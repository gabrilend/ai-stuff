shanna-lib is a library for text input using a joypad direction stick which
supports multiple different graphics backends and is easily hot-swappable in-or
out with whichever type of programming the user is likely to perform.

in this case, raylib with C, love with Lua, Bevy with Rust, and HTML5 with web.

#each of these should have importable versions of this library which primarily
#acts as an input translation layer for inputting text using only a control stick
#input device. By default, the system doesn't use buttons, preferring instead to
#use a time-out based approach with specific spots holding values as both
#code and data, but if buttons are provided then the code can be brought out and
#more of the input possibilities can be used for data.
#
#the data in this case being whichever text you wanted to input, by default only
#the english letters but with button presses or by selecting a specific field in
#the display able to switch to any other keyboards.

that part above is garbage don't listen to it

listen to this part instead:

shanna-lib is a portable joystick-to-keyboard emulation solution. It fits into
all of your favorite games, essentially allowing you to add text-input
capabilities to any handheld game console. Or others too but I'm focusing on the
handheld consoles for now.
