when compiling, prefer using multiple steps, each with their own error and
validation checks. As it's building, save a state of it in each part of it's
path. Trustwise, it'll make it easier to change the system later on if they
can watch how it's unfolding.

data storage is cheap. use it. change it if it's on HDD. on SD cards and flash
                                                         drives and such it's
                                                         better to write slowly
                                                         or rather bit-by-bit
                                                         with a timer on it
                                                         to show battery balance
                                                         and health

I took an oath

I will never dissuage it.
