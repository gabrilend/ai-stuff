# Healer-TD Project Directory Structure

This document outlines the organization and usage of directories in the 
healer-td project.

## Directory Structure

### `/docs/`
**Purpose**: Documentation generated by AI assistant  
**Usage**: Contains all AI-generated documentation including game design 
documents, technical specifications, user manuals, and other project 
documentation. This directory should not contain human-written files.

### `/notes/`
**Purpose**: Human-created files and notes  
**Usage**: Contains vision documents, design notes, meeting notes, and other 
human-authored content. The primary source of truth for project direction 
and requirements.

### `/src/`
**Purpose**: Source code  
**Usage**: Contains all game source code, libraries, and implementation 
files. Organized by functionality and following the project's coding 
conventions.

### `/issues/`
**Purpose**: Issue tracking and task management  
**Usage**: Contains ticket files for features, bugs, and tasks to be worked 
on. Each issue should be implemented as a separate file.

#### Issue File Naming Convention
Issues should be named with the following format:
```
{ID}-{brief-description}
```

**Examples**:
- `135-highlighted-statistic-print-debugging`
- `042-tower-placement-validation`
- `088-multiplayer-sync-protocol`

#### Issue File Contents
Each issue file should contain:
- Problem description
- Current behavior (if applicable)
- Expected behavior
- Suggested implementation approach
- Acceptance criteria
- Priority level

### `/issues/completed/`
**Purpose**: Completed issues archive  
**Usage**: When an issue is resolved and implemented, move the issue file 
from `/issues/` to `/issues/completed/` to maintain a record of completed 
work.

## Workflow

1. **Planning**: Create issue files in `/issues/` for any changes or 
   features to be implemented
2. **Implementation**: Work on issues by referencing the files in `/issues/`
3. **Documentation**: AI-generated documentation goes in `/docs/`
4. **Completion**: Move completed issue files to `/issues/completed/`
5. **Notes**: Human insights and design decisions go in `/notes/`

## File Management Rules

- **Never delete completed issues** - move them to `/issues/completed/`
- **One issue per file** - keep issues focused and atomic
- **Update issue files** during implementation if requirements change
- **Reference issue IDs** in commit messages and documentation
- **Keep `/docs/` current** - regenerate documentation when vision or 
  requirements change

## AI Assistant Guidelines

When working on this project, the AI assistant should:
- Create issue files before implementing any changes
- Generate documentation in `/docs/` based on `/notes/` content
- Follow the directory structure strictly
- Reference existing issues when making changes
- Update documentation when implementation deviates from original design
