the trick to reality is you only observe what has been erased from your mind by
temporality. if your mind was continually being erased [while you're stoned]
you could learn anything you want. you'd instantly know it. hence, why you have
to encode it in matter. it's so, so hard. but you are optimized for it, it's
what truly is you.
