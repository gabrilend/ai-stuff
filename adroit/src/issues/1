split up the video file in /video-inspiration/ into parts large enough
to analyze either directly by an LLM (not ideal, lots of wasted bits) or with
a transcription style programming device. image recognition probably, with text
and speech recognition as well. Alternatively, if the 12 hour video is split
into 0.12 hour chunks, there'll only be 100 of them. These can be analyzed more
concretely and with smaller junctions of separated timethoughtspace.
