# Architecture Overview

## Current Implementation Status

### Phase 1 Implementation Complete
- ✅ Rolling Memory System - Implemented in Lua with sinusoidal heartbeat mathematics
- ✅ Local LLM Integration - Using Ollama with existing infrastructure patterns
- ✅ Heartbeat-based Processing - Autonomous daemon with V(t) = Vmax sin(2πft) cycles
- ✅ "Think twice to remember" mechanism - Functional importance scoring and persistence
- ✅ File-based conversation logging - Continuous output and state management

### Transition from Vision to Implementation
**Original Vision**: Text-based concept requiring local LLM with rolling context and memory persistence
**Current Reality**: Functional autonomous system with mathematical heartbeat cycles, running daemon processes, and persistent memory states across sessions

### Decision: Unsorted Requirements Location
The unsorted directory is located in the issues directory inside the root directory of the project. The potential unsorted requirements mentioned are indeed the sort of suggested implementations to examine in the /home/ritz/programming/ai-stuff/ directory, in addition to any other locations found by examining notes, scripts, or document files somewhere in the project directory.
