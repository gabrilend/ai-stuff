# Issue 003: File Output Management System

## Current Behavior
No system exists to save LLM outputs to files or manage the accumulation of conversation data.

## Intended Behavior
Create a file management system that saves LLM outputs, manages file rotation, and maintains conversation continuity through file-based storage.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design file naming and organization scheme
2. Implement automatic file creation for new conversations
3. Create file rotation logic based on size or time limits
4. Develop conversation threading across multiple files
5. Implement file cleanup and archival strategies
6. Create file recovery and restoration mechanisms
7. Test file integrity and conversation continuity

## Priority
Medium - Important for data persistence but not blocking other development

## Estimated Effort
Medium - Standard file I/O with some complexity in rotation logic
