# Issue 002: Rolling Context Window Implementation

## Current Behavior
No context management system exists to maintain conversation history across multiple interactions.

## Intended Behavior
Implement a rolling context window that maintains conversation history, automatically manages context length limits, and preserves important information through "think twice to remember" mechanism.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design context window data structure
2. Implement context length monitoring
3. Create importance scoring algorithm for content retention
4. Develop context pruning strategies
5. Implement "remember twice" persistence mechanism
6. Create context serialization for file storage
7. Test context continuity across sessions
