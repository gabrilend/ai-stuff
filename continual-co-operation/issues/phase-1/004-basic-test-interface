# Issue 004: Basic Test Interface

## Current Behavior
No user interface exists to interact with the rolling memory system or test its functionality.

## Intended Behavior
Create a simple command-line or basic GUI interface that allows users to interact with the LLM, observe the rolling memory behavior, and test the system's functionality.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design simple command-line interface
2. Implement basic chat functionality
3. Add memory status display (context window state)
4. Create debugging and monitoring features
5. Implement session save/load functionality
6. Add configuration options for testing different parameters
7. Create basic help and documentation system
