# Issue 005: Memory Persistence Mechanism

## Current Behavior
No mechanism exists to persist important memories or maintain state across system restarts.

## Intended Behavior
Implement a robust memory persistence system that can save and restore conversation state, important memories, and system configuration across restarts and sessions.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design memory serialization format
2. Implement state save/restore functionality
3. Create important memory tagging system
4. Develop incremental backup strategies
5. Implement memory verification and integrity checking
6. Create memory migration and upgrade paths
7. Test persistence across system restarts and failures
