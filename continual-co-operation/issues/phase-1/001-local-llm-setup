# Issue 001: Local LLM Setup and Configuration

## Current Behavior
No local LLM is currently configured or running in the system.

## Intended Behavior
A local Large Language Model should be set up and accessible for the rolling memory system to use for generating responses and maintaining context.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Research and select appropriate local LLM (Ollama, LM Studio, or similar)
2. Create installation and setup scripts
3. Configure model parameters for optimal memory usage
4. Implement basic API interface for model interaction
5. Create configuration management system
6. Test model responsiveness and output quality

## Priority
High - This is a foundational component for the entire system

## Estimated Effort
Medium - Requires research and configuration but well-documented tools exist

## Dependencies
- System hardware requirements for LLM hosting
- Network configuration for local model access
