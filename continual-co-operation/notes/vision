hi can you make a program that runs a local LLM and saves the output to a file
and the next output that is saved adds it in as context until it reaches it's
max context limit and then the next one is the next one plus all but the last
one, essentially creating a "rolling memory" system where if you want to
remember anything, you gotta think about it twice. Then, when one falls out of
context, write it again. As long as you think it's important... Important things
can be written to ram with a simple bash script call. This call is never
actually run, instead an interpreter scans through the document, finds all of
the function calls, and then runs them and writes the result there.

then, design it around the principles in the projects related to heartbeats, and
that one circular oracle dice result, and the golem project in chatGPT.

that should just about do artificial intelligence. then, do the new digging
implement design to create thin robots that are surrounded by a material like
clay

give them a processing center, and they're good and find and okay.

give them a personality center like I've outlined above, and they're alive and
unique and okay.

give them imaginative intuition by building in Scratch,

and suddenly your program is accessible to children, the most imaginative ones
around.

let THEM program it lol
