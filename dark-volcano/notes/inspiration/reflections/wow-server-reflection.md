# Reflection on wow-server

## Document Design Analysis

The wow-server document provides comprehensive modification specifications
with clear sectional organization and detailed mechanical explanations.
Demonstrates understanding of both original World of Warcraft systems
and collaborative gameplay design principles. Technical, systematic
writing balances idealistic goals ("cogs in a machine" philosophy)
with practical constraints (level caps, standardized systems).

## Relationship to Dark Volcano Project

This document tests multiplayer mechanics that inform Dark Volcano:

- **Faction Cooperation**: Shared resource pools test concepts for Dark
  Volcano's party-based cooperation and formation coordination systems
- **Simplified Combat**: Standardized, rhythmic combat informs Dark
  Volcano's tick-based damage calculation with predictable timing
- **Economic Integration**: Profession-to-military pipeline demonstrates
  how Dark Volcano's building inputs/outputs create player interdependence

The "cogs in a machine" philosophy aligns with Dark Volcano's indirect
control where players guide rather than directly command units.

## Connections to Other Notes

- **symbeline-aspects**: Faction resource management tests three-aspect
  economic systems in multiplayer environment
- **symbeline**: Implements communal focus design philosophy in constrained,
  testable environment  
- **majesty-ai**: NPC faction systems require sophisticated AI for patrol
  and raid coordination similar to Dark Volcano's unit personalities
- **symbeline-structures**: Tests economic circulation and profession
  integration concepts in multiplayer context

## Valuable Insights

• **Communal Resources**: Shared faction pools create investment in
  collective success rather than individual advancement

• **Simplified Systems**: Reducing complexity (standardized speeds,
  limited levels) enhances strategic depth through predictability

• **Rhythmic Combat**: Predictable timing enables coordination and
  satisfying tactical exchanges

• **Economic Integration**: Connecting crafting to military effectiveness
  creates meaningful interdependence between gameplay systems

• **Temporal Dynamics**: Different faction timing (day/night raids)
  creates natural pacing and strategic considerations

• **Automated Systems**: NPC patrols and raids create persistent world
  activity independent of player actions
