# Reflection on symbeline-structures

## Document Design Analysis

The symbeline-structures document presents a modern fantasy reinterpretation
of Majesty mechanics, centered on heroes keeping gold at home rather
than guilds. Uses clear categorical thinking (three encounter options,
multiple resource approaches) while maintaining thematic consistency
with "mordaunts" instead of monsters. Combines practical design with
philosophical world-building elements.

## Relationship to Dark Volcano Project

This document explores alternative approaches to Dark Volcano systems:

- **Single Unit Type**: Simplifies Dark Volcano's FFTA class complexity
  while maintaining depth through equipment and personality variation
- **Economic Circulation**: Gold circulation concept aligns with Dark
  Volcano's resource flow where items never truly disappear, just move
  between systems or sink to the volcanic core (Issue 004)
- **Encounter Philosophy**: The three-option approach (invite, farm, slay)
  could inform Dark Volcano's strategic map location interaction systems

The library communication system suggests innovative multiplayer
information sharing that could enhance Dark Volcano's strategic depth.

## Connections to Other Notes

- **symbeline**: Simplified version of core city-building concepts
- **symbeline-aspects**: Three encounter options mirror diplomatic
  aspect's nuanced interaction systems
- **majesty-ai**: Single adventurer type simplifies AI requirements
  while maintaining behavioral complexity through personality matrices
- **wow-server**: Economic circulation concepts inform faction resource
  sharing and balance systems

## Valuable Insights

• **Simplified Depth**: One flexible unit type with equipment variation
  can create complexity without overwhelming class management systems

• **Moral Encounters**: Three-option monster interactions (invite/farm/slay)
  create meaningful strategic and ethical choices

• **Resource Circulation**: Preventing economic resource loss creates
  dynamic flow-based gameplay rather than scarcity management

• **Spiritual Reframing**: "Spirits convinced otherwise" opens redemption
  and conversion mechanics beyond simple combat resolution

• **Hidden Networks**: Library-based communication suggests creative
  asynchronous multiplayer interaction and community building systems
