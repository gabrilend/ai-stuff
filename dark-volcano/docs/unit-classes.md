# Dark Volcano - Unit Classes

## Overview
Dark Volcano's unit class system draws extensively from Final Fantasy Tactics Advance (FFTA), adapting the deep job progression and diverse tactical roles to fit the game's Tron-inspired aesthetic and procedural combat mechanics. Each class maintains the relative strengths and strategic roles from FFTA while being reimagined as energy-wielding warriors in the Dark Volcano universe.

## Comprehensive Class Analysis

The class system preserves FFTA's fundamental design philosophy where different races excel at different types of combat roles, creating natural synergies and tactical specializations.

### Class Synergy and Equipment Integration

#### **Stat-Based Synergies**
Rather than class-specific bonuses, Dark Volcano emphasizes stat-based synergies that emerge naturally from equipment and formation choices. Units with high magic power amplify each other's spell effects, while high-speed units create tactical positioning advantages that benefit the entire formation.

#### **Equipment-Driven Abilities**
All special abilities are tied to equipment rather than being inherent to classes. This allows for greater customization flexibility while maintaining class identity through stat preferences and equipment compatibility. A Black Mage wearing fire-enhancing robes gains fire magic abilities, while the same robes on a Red Mage create hybrid magical effects.

#### **Formation Interactions**
Classes interact differently within the three formation types. Circle formations benefit classes that enhance each other's capabilities (like multiple mages amplifying magical power), while Box formations allow for specialized roles (like placing a Defender in the center to protect surrounding attackers).

#### **Tron Integration Principles**
- **Visual Distinction**: Each class has unique energy signatures and light patterns
- **Procedural Animation**: Class characteristics influence procedural movement and combat animations
- **Equipment Visualization**: Equipment effects are immediately visible through energy patterns and geometric effects
- **Combat Integration**: Class abilities create unique visual effects that enhance the Tron aesthetic while providing clear tactical feedback

This comprehensive class system maintains FFTA's strategic depth while adapting to Dark Volcano's innovative technical architecture and visual design philosophy.
