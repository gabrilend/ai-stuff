# Issue 001: Project Setup and Engine Selection

## Current Behavior
Project exists only as vision document and initial documentation structure.

## Intended Behavior
Complete game development environment setup with chosen game engine, build tools, and project structure ready for development.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Set up Raylib development environment for prototype
2. Create basic triangle/quad model rendering system
3. Implement vibrant edge rendering with glow effects
4. Set up dark background with bright neon outlines
5. Configure version control and build pipeline
6. Establish coding standards and conventions
7. Create basic scene/level setup with camera system

## Priority
High - Blocking all other development

## Estimated Effort
1-2 weeks

## Dependencies
None
