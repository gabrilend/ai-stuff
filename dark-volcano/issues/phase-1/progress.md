## Progress Status
- **Issues Created**: 12/12 ✓
- **Issues Completed**: 0/12
- **Phase Completion**: 0%

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Visual Transformation)
1. **Issue 011** (Git Repository Setup) - Required before making permanent changes
2. **Issue 012** (Art Style Transformation) - Core visual transformation planning
3. **Issue 001** (Project Setup) - Engine assessment for art asset requirements

### Core System Development (with Fantasy Art)
4. **Issues 003/005** - Unit system and visual style (implement with fantasy theme)
5. **Issues 002, 006, 007, 008** - Core gameplay systems with fantasy aesthetics
6. **Issues 004, 009, 010** - Advanced systems with fantasy visual integration

**Revised Priority**: 011 → 012 → 001 → 003/005 → 002/006/007/008 → 004/009/010

## Phase 1 Success Criteria

### Visual Transformation Requirements

- [ ] AI personality matrix functional (existing 4-color system)

### Technical Systems
- [ ] Fantasy art assets integrated without performance loss
- [ ] All existing gameplay mechanics preserved unchanged
- [ ] GPU rendering architecture operational with fantasy assets
- [ ] Procedural animation system working with fantasy themes

## Estimated Timeline
16-20 weeks for complete Phase 1 implementation with 1-2 developers.
(Timeline includes visual transformation requirements and integration of fantasy assets with existing systems)
