Issue Lifecycle:
1. When an issue is completed, move it here from its source location
2. Update the relevant progress.md file
3. Update docs/table-of-contents.md
4. Commit the changes to version control

Demo Scripts:
Each completed phase should have a demo script in demos/ that:
- Demonstrates the functionality developed in that phase
- Shows statistics and datapoints where applicable
- Can be run with a simple bash command
- Uses tools from previous phases in new ways

See: issue-029-demo-runner-script.md for the demo runner utility.
