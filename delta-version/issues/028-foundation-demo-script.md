# Issue 028: Foundation Demo Script

## Current Behavior
No demonstration capability exists to showcase the Phase 1 foundation infrastructure features and validate that all core utilities are working properly.

## Intended Behavior
Create a comprehensive demo script that showcases all Phase 1 features including project discovery, structure validation, metadata management, and basic reporting capabilities.

## Suggested Implementation Steps

1. **Demo Script Architecture**
   - Design interactive demo workflow
   - Create modular demo components for each feature
   - Implement demo data preparation and cleanup

2. **Feature Demonstrations**
   - Project listing and discovery showcase
   - Repository structure validation demonstration
   - Project metadata display and management
   - Basic reporting examples

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - User-driven demo navigation
   - Real-time feature execution
   - Visual output formatting and display
   - Performance metrics and statistics

4. **Demo Integration**
   - Integrate all Phase 1 utilities
   - Create seamless workflow between features
   - Implement error handling and graceful degradation
   - Add comprehensive demo documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Demo script runs all Phase 1 features
- [ ] Interactive navigation functional
- [ ] Visual output properly formatted
- [ ] Demo showcases practical utility of all features
