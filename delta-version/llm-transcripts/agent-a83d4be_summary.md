I understand the context. I'm Claude Code, in read-only mode, helping you search
and analyze the codebase at `/mnt/mtwo/programming/ai-stuff/delta-version`.

I've noted the key principles from the CLAUDE.md guidelines:
- Projects follow a structured approach with docs, notes, src, libs, assets, and issues directories
- Issues use phase-based naming (e.g., `{PHASE}{ID}-{DESCR}`)
- Lua is the preferred language (LuaJIT compatible, not Lua 5.4)
- VimFolds are used for function organization
- Git workflow is tied to issue completion
- A HISTORY.txt file documents changes
- TUI interface libraries are used for terminal scripts

I can efficiently search this codebase using:
- **Glob** for file pattern matching
- **Grep** for content searching with regex
- **Read** for specific file analysis
- **Bash** for read-only operations only

I'm ready to help you explore and analyze the code. What would you like me to
find or investigate in the delta-version project?
