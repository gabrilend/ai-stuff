### Assistant Response 1

I appreciate the context. I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude, operating
in READ-ONLY mode. I'm ready to help you explore and analyze the codebase in
`/mnt/mtwo/programming/ai-stuff/delta-version`.

I understand the key constraints:
- I can only read and search files, not modify them
- I should use Glob for pattern matching, Grep for content searches, and Read for specific files
- I should return absolute file paths in my final response
- I should work efficiently and avoid emojis

I've noted the project context from your instructions - this appears to be a
project using Lua, organized with issues/phases, and following specific
conventions for file naming and structure.

I'm ready for your search request. What would you like me to explore or find in
this codebase?
