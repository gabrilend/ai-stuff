### User Request 1

hi, can you familiarize yourself with the project and then format the two
unformatted issue files in /issues/?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 1

Done! I've formatted both issue files according to the project's template:

## Files Created

| Original File | New Issue File |
|---------------|----------------|
| `pricing-shanna.md` | `033-creator-revenue-sharing-system.md` |
| `pricing-shanna-2.md` | `034-bug-bounty-reward-system.md` |

## Issue Summaries

**Issue 033 - Creator Revenue Sharing System**
- Enables monetization of derivative content (like Warcraft 3 maps)
- Revenue portions held in escrow for original IP creators
- Funds held indefinitely until claimed—never spent unilaterally
- Original creators can redirect funds to "new projects for users"

**Issue 034 - Bug Bounty Reward System**  
- Auto-creates bounties for bugs with 3+ failed revision attempts
- Tracks solvers in an expert registry for future consultation
- Token economy indexed to company stock value
- "Poker chip return kiosk" model for exchanging tokens → dollars

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- Both issues share a philosophy of **consent-based distribution**—rewards are offered but not forced, attention signals interest without creating obligation
- The expert registry concept is interesting: it creates a meritocratic knowledge base where expertise is proven through demonstrated problem-solving rather than credentials
- The stock-indexed token model aligns contributor incentives with project success, creating ownership without the legal complexity of actual equity

The progress file has also been updated with the new issues. The old unformatted
files have been removed.
