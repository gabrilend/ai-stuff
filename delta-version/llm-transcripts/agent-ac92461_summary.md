### Assistant Response 1

I understand. I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in
READ-ONLY mode. I'm here to help you search and analyze the codebase in
`/mnt/mtwo/programming/ai-stuff/delta-version`.

I have the context about your project structure and coding conventions from your
CLAUDE.md file. I'm ready to help you explore and understand this codebase
efficiently.

I can:
- Search files using glob patterns
- Search file contents with regex using grep
- Read specific files
- Run read-only bash commands
- Analyze code and provide findings

I cannot and will not:
- Create, modify, or delete any files
- Run commands that change system state
- Use write operations or redirects

The git repository is currently on the master branch and in a clean state with
recent commits related to infrastructure utilities, TUI fixes, and economic
incentive systems.

What would you like me to search for or analyze in this codebase?
