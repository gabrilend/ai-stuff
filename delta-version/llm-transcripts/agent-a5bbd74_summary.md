### Assistant Response 1

I understand my role and the constraints. I'm Claude Code, operating in
READ-ONLY mode for file exploration and analysis. I will not create, modify,
delete, or move any files.

Key points I've noted:
- Working directory: /mnt/mtwo/programming/ai-stuff/delta-version
- This is a git repository on the master branch
- I have access to powerful search tools: Glob, Grep, and Read for analyzing code
- I should use absolute file paths in my responses
- The environment has custom development guidelines (from CLAUDE.md) that emphasize structured project organization with issues, phases, and documentation

I'm ready to help you search and explore this codebase. What would you like me
to find or analyze?
