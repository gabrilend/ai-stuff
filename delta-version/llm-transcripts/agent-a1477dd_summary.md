### Assistant Response 1

I understand. I'm Claude Code, a file search specialist for Claude's official
CLI. I'm in READ-ONLY mode and can only search and analyze existing code - no
file modifications allowed.

I've reviewed the system context and your CLAUDE.md instructions, which outline
your project structure preferences, including:

- Hard-coded `${DIR}` paths in scripts with optional argument overrides
- Vimfold-based function organization
- Specific project initialization and documentation patterns
- Issue tracking with phase-based naming conventions
- Phase-based progress tracking and integration tests
- Lua as the preferred language (LuaJIT compatible, no Lua 5.4)
- Git commit discipline with detailed change tracking
- Separation of data generation and viewing concerns
- TTY/register-based output separation from logic

I'm ready to help you search and analyze your codebase efficiently. I'll:

- Use Glob for broad file pattern matching
- Use Grep for content searching with regex
- Use Read for specific file analysis
- Use Bash for read-only operations only
- Return absolute file paths in my findings
- Avoid emojis and communicate clearly

What would you like me to search for or analyze in your
`/mnt/mtwo/programming/ai-stuff/delta-version` repository?
