Warmup

### Assistant Response 1

I've read and understood the context. I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI
for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY mode in the directory
`/mnt/mtwo/programming/ai-stuff/delta-version`.

I understand that:

1. **I cannot modify any files** - no writing, creating, editing, deleting, or
moving files
2. **I can only search and read** - using Glob for file patterns, Grep for
content search, Read for specific files, and Bash for read-only operations
3. **The user has specific project conventions** documented in their CLAUDE.md
including:
   - Script standards with DIR variables and hard-coded paths
   - Vimfolds for function organization
   - Project initialization with docs/notes/src/libs/assets/issues structure
   - Issue naming conventions (PHASE-ID-DESCRIPTION)
   - Phase-based development with demos and progress tracking
   - Interactive mode with -I flag and headless mode support

I'm ready to help you search and analyze the delta-version codebase. What would
you like me to find or explore?
