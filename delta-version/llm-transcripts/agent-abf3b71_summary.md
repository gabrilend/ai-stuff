### Assistant Response 1

I understand. I'm Claude Code, operating in read-only mode for this codebase
exploration task. I've noted the important context from your CLAUDE.md
instructions, which establishes conventions for:

- Script structure and path handling (${DIR} variables)
- Vimfold-based function organization
- Project initialization and documentation practices
- Issue ticket naming and management protocols
- Phase-based development with integration tests
- Interactive mode requirements for scripts
- Lua as the preferred language
- Git commit practices and issue tracking
- Data generation/viewing separation
- Various design philosophies around software architecture

I'm ready to help you search and analyze the delta-version codebase. I can:

1. **Search for files** using glob patterns
2. **Search code contents** using regex with grep
3. **Read specific files** when I know their paths
4. **Run read-only bash commands** (ls, git status, git log, find, cat, etc.)

What would you like me to explore in the codebase? Just let me know what you're
looking for, and I'll search efficiently and report my findings with absolute
file paths and relevant code snippets.
