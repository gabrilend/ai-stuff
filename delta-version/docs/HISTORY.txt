[4] Issue 035a: Implement project detection and external import
    2025-12-17

    Adds unified workflow for project onboarding to reconstruct-history.sh:
    Project Detection:
    - is_in_monorepo(): Detects if project is inside monorepo
    - has_flat_history(): Identifies projects with few commits but many files
    - has_good_history(): Checks if commit/file ratio is healthy
    - determine_project_state(): Classifies as external/no_git/flat_blob/sparse_history/good_history
    Blob Boundary Detection:
    - find_blob_commits(): Identifies large file-dump commits
    - get_blob_boundary(): Finds where "real" development starts
    - count_post_blob_commits(): Counts commits to preserve
    External Import:
    - import_external_project(): Copies with timestamp preservation (cp -a)
    - Supports --name override and --move mode
    - Removes existing .git after import
    Unified Workflow:
    - process_project(): Routes each state to appropriate action
    - Preserves post-blob commits (warns if present, --force required)
    - Enhanced dry-run report shows state and planned actions
    Parent issue 035 defines full reconstruction strategy with sub-issues
    035b-035f for remaining features (dependency graph, date estimation,
    file association, history rewrite, LLM integration).

[5] Issue 036: Create commit history viewer specification
    2025-12-17

    Defines a terminal-based viewer for browsing project git history as a
    readable narrative, presenting commits like pages of a book.
    Core Features:
    - Project selection (integrates with list-projects.sh)
    - Left/right navigation flips between commits
    - Up/down navigation scrolls within commit content
    - Double-tap up/down jumps to top/bottom
    - Position preserved when flipping commits
    Content Display Order:
    1. Commit message (always at top)
    2. Changed files from notes/ directory
    3. Completed issues (issues/completed/)
    4. Documentation (docs/)
    5. Other markdown files
    Sub-issues planned:
    - 036a: Project selection interface
    - 036b: Git commit traversal
    - 036c: Content extraction and ordering
    - 036d: Paginator TUI component
    - 036e: Navigation and input handling
    - 036f: Session state management
    Blocked by Issue 035 (Project History Reconstruction) - projects need
    meaningful reconstructed history before viewing makes sense.

[6] Issue 037: Create project history narrative generator specification
    2025-12-17

    Defines a script to generate readable HISTORY.txt files from git log,
    presenting project development as a story readable from top to bottom.
    Output Format:
    - Chronological order (oldest commit first, like reading a book)
    - Numbered commits with clean date display
    - Full commit messages (subject + body)
    - Visual separation with dashes and newlines
    - Header with project name, footer with commit count
    Features:
    - Process single project or all projects (--all)
    - Configurable output location and filename
    - Multiple formats: txt (default), md, html
    - Skip projects with few commits (--min-commits)
    - Date range filtering (--since, --until)
    Related to CLAUDE.md requirement: "git log should be appended to a
    long history file... prettified... that can be grepped through easily.
    Or, printed and read like a book."

[7] Issues 036, 037: Clarify completed vs new issue handling
    2025-12-17

    Both viewer scripts should focus on COMPLETED issues (actual work done),
    not newly-added issue specifications (just planning).
    Key distinctions:
    - issues/completed/*.md → Show these (completed work)
    - issues/*.md (root) → Skip these (just plans/specs)
    - Retroactive tickets (added directly to completed/) → Treat as completed
    Issue 036 changes:
    - Updated content display to exclude issues/ root
    - Added explicit skip logic for issues/*.md in extraction algorithm
    - Clarified that issues/completed/ represents done work
    Issue 037 changes:
    - Added "Commit Classification" section with narrative value ratings
    - Added --completed-only and --skip-specs filtering options
    - Documented retroactive ticket handling
    Rationale: Creating an issue spec is planning; moving/adding to
    issues/completed/ is documentation of actual implementation work.
    The narrative should reflect work done, not intentions.

[8] Add issue prioritization document
    2025-12-17

    Creates PRIORITY.md with analysis of all open issues based on:
    - Blocking relationships
    - Immediate utility
    - Complexity
    - Foundation vs feature work
    Priority Tiers:
    TIER 1 (HIGH): 035 sub-issues, 037 narrative generator, 008 docs
    TIER 2 (MED-HIGH): 036 viewer, 013-015 gitignore chain, 024 external dirs
    TIER 3 (MEDIUM): 026 metadata, 027 reports, 016-022 ticket system
    TIER 4 (LOW): 032-034 economic incentive systems
    Key insight: Issue 035 (history reconstruction) is the critical path -
    it blocks the commit viewer (036) and improves all downstream tools.
    Issue 037 (narrative generator) can proceed in parallel as low-hanging fruit.
    Includes blocking diagram and "what to work on" quick reference.
