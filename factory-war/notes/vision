Factory War is a game about creating factories and defeating your opponents.
The gameplay is similar to Supreme Commander, but without any of the micro.
Units move without being prompted, and if without orders will self destruct.
Therefore, it is important to give them orders if you wish to defeat your foes.

the gameplay involves building factories to help scale faster and better than
your opponent, while also using those factories to create units which will
reinforce frontlines and push your foes back, thus securing resource nodes for
you or your team. By claiming a larger portion of the map, you increase your
resources, and in doing so help secure a victory for yourself and your team.

The game has air, land, and naval combat. The land combat is implemented first,
while air and naval are supplementary.

land units include tanks,
