## 📋 Project Context Files

### 🌍 Global CLAUDE.md

```markdown
- all scripts should be written assuming they are to be run from any directory. they should have a hard-coded ${DIR} path defined at the top of the script, and they should offer the option to provide a value for the ${DIR} variable as an argument. All paths in the program should be relative to the ${DIR} variable.
- all functions should use vimfolds to collapse functionality. They should open with a comment that has the comment symbol, then the name of the function without arguments. On the next line, the function should be defined with arguments. Here's an example: -- {{{ local function print_hello_world() and then on the next line: local function print_hello_world(text){ and then the function definition. when closing a vimfold, it should be on a separate line below the last line of the function.
- to create a project, mkdir docs notes src libs assets
- to initialize a project, read the vision document located in prj-dir/notes/vision - then create documentation related to it in prj-dir/docs/ - then repeat, then repeat. Ensure there is a roadmap document split into phases. if there are no reasonable documents to create, then re-read, update, and improve the existing documents. Then, break the roadmap file into issues, starting with the prj-dir/issues/phase-1/ directory. be as specific as need be. ensure that issues are created with these protocols: name: ID-descr where ID is the sequential ID number of the issue problem idea ticket, and descr is a dash-separated short one-sentence description of the issue. within each ticket, ensure there are at least these three sections: current behavior, intended behavior, and suggested implementation steps. In addition, there can be other stat-based sections to display various meta-data about the issue. There may also be a related documents or tools section. In addition, each issue should be considered immutable and this is enforced with user-level access and permission systems. It is necessary to preserve consent of access to imagination. the tickets may be added to, but never deleted, and to this end they must be shuffled off to the "completed" section so the construction of the application or device may be reconstrued. Ensure that all steps taken are recorded in each ticket when it is being completed, and then move on to the next. At each phase, a test-program should be created / updated-with-entirely-new-content which displays the progress of the program. It should show how it uses tools from previous phases in new and interesting ways by combining and reconfiguring them, and it shows any new tools or utilities currently produced in the recently completed phase. This test program should be runnable with a simple bash script, and it should live in the issues/completed/phase-X/ directory, where X is the number of the phase of the project's lifecycle. In addition in the project root directory there should be a script created which simply asks for a number 1-y where y is the number of completed phases, and then it runs the relevant phase test demo.
- bash commands or scripts that can be called from the command line should have a flag -I which runs the script in interactive mode. Meaning, the commands will be built by querying the user for each category of possible flag. Ideally, few flag categories, many flag options within each category.
- all interactive modes should allow for index based selection of options in addition to arrow-key and vim-keybinding navigation. (i is select in vim mode, also shift+A)
- for every implemented change to the project, there must always be an issue file. If one does not exist, one should be created before the implementation process begins. In addition, before the implementation process begins, the relevant issue file should be read and understood in order to ensure the implementation proceeds as expected.
- prefer error messages and breaking functionality over fallbacks. Be sure to query the user every time a fallback is used.

### 🔮 Vision: vision

```
I decided to learn risc-v assembly, and this is the university playground made.

each of the directories in /home/ritz/programming/ai-stuff/ contain a sample
project, all of them incomplete, and all of them serving as examples of the
design and philosophy of the example projects built for university.

All in risc-v assembly.

there are many documents and vision statements, and many of them are useful.
the source-code is always broken, to give the student room to explore.
and none of it is in risc-v assembly.
that is reserved for this directory, the risc-v-university-playground.

in this directory, we start by creating lesson plans. we do this after reviewing
the tickets of suggested or intended next-steps for learning the systems.

future phases should include all the concepts discussed in previous ones,
making up side-quests and similar-objectives which use the previous functionality
in the new and revising current subject.

the ordering of the syllabus matters, but it's vague and broken down by chapter
so there's plenty of room to expand. in fact, each chapter gets it's own
directory, with several .md files that explain a particular concept. ideally,
with examples, or picture diagrams which illustrate a point. these can be
constructed with code that produces arrow diagrams pointing at variables which
represent various concepts and which have x,y positions and are arranged
in a map pseudo-randomly according to theme as determined by an LLM embedding
which can be found in one or more of the directories above.

the issues in this project include all work items that may be completed while
building the project. No ticket, no work is done. everything must be written
down, captured somewhere, ideally in the relevant ticket but sometimes in
related and assorted documentation. Ideally, this documentation would be
referenced in the ticket as well, with information appended but not edited.

the examples can start out simple. they should grow in complexity as the users
toolkit is created and expanded. new ideas and new concepts should emerge, as
the user creates tickets and the build-out of capabilities is un-depleted.

a description of each inspirational example project (none of which are editable)
should be included in the docs directory, in a subdirectory called examples.
these examples should have lists of required functionality (functions and data-
-structures and cyclical operations (services)) that are required for that
example but which are not present in the "recently-explained-functionalities.md"
file.

each vision file should be mentioned in a summary that includes the most unique
keys or related descriptors for each vision file, so it may be easily found
when being examined by data.

in general, files that feel important or shallow should be examined and updated
more than once in the same or different contexts. Often it makes sense to read
in one file, write and update it with what's earlier in context, then read a 
different file, then update the first one again. other times it makes sense to
read in a file, update it, then read in a nother file, then combine both and
create a new one and remove both old files. There are many designs patterns to
find, see if you can collect them all!

special attention and care should be taken to explaining the non-algorithmic
features and considerations of risc-v. each consideration or feature should have
a lesson oriented around it, with an emphasis on exploring new topics and not on
routine or exercise. there must always be luck involved - let the player user
take the next step.

I decided to learn risc-v assembly, and this is the university playground made.

each of the directories in /home/ritz/programming/ai-stuff/ contain a sample
project, all of them incomplete, and all of them serving as examples of the
design and philosophy of the example projects built for university.

All in risc-v assembly.

there are many documents and vision statements, and many of them are useful.
the source-code is always broken, to give the student room to explore.
and none of it is in risc-v assembly.
that is reserved for this directory, the risc-v-university-playground.

in this directory, we start by creating lesson plans. we do this after reviewing
the tickets of suggested or intended next-steps for learning the systems.

future phases should include all the concepts discussed in previous ones,
making up side-quests and similar-objectives which use the previous functionality
in the new and revising current subject.

the ordering of the syllabus matters, but it's vague and broken down by chapter
so there's plenty of room to expand. in fact, each chapter gets it's own
directory, with several .md files that explain a particular concept. ideally,
with examples, or picture diagrams which illustrate a point. these can be
constructed with code that produces arrow diagrams pointing at variables which
represent various concepts and which have x,y positions and are arranged
in a map pseudo-randomly according to theme as determined by an LLM embedding
which can be found in one or more of the directories above.

the issues in this project include all work items that may be completed while
building the project. No ticket, no work is done. everything must be written
down, captured somewhere, ideally in the relevant ticket but sometimes in
related and assorted documentation. Ideally, this documentation would be
referenced in the ticket as well, with information appended but not edited.

the examples can start out simple. they should grow in complexity as the users
toolkit is created and expanded. new ideas and new concepts should emerge, as
the user creates tickets and the build-out of capabilities is un-depleted.

a description of each inspirational example project (none of which are editable)
should be included in the docs directory, in a subdirectory called examples.
these examples should have lists of required functionality (functions and data-
-structures and cyclical operations (services)) that are required for that
example but which are not present in the "recently-explained-functionalities.md"
file.

each vision file should be mentioned in a summary that includes the most unique
keys or related descriptors for each vision file, so it may be easily found
when being examined by data.

in general, files that feel important or shallow should be examined and updated
more than once in the same or different contexts. Often it makes sense to read
in one file, write and update it with what's earlier in context, then read a 
different file, then update the first one again. other times it makes sense to
read in a file, update it, then read in a nother file, then combine both and
create a new one and remove both old files. There are many designs patterns to
find, see if you can collect them all!

special attention and care should be taken to explaining the non-algorithmic
features and considerations of risc-v. each consideration or feature should have
a lesson oriented around it, with an emphasis on exploring new topics and not on
routine or exercise. there must always be luck involved - let the player user
take the next step.

- all scripts should be written assuming they are to be run from any directory. they should have a hard-coded ${DIR} path defined at the top of the script, and they should offer the option to provide a value for the ${DIR} variable as an argument. All paths in the program should be relative to the ${DIR} variable.
- all functions should use vimfolds to collapse functionality. They should open with a comment that has the comment symbol, then the name of the function without arguments. On the next line, the function should be defined with arguments. Here's an example: -- {{{ local function print_hello_world() and then on the next line: local function print_hello_world(text){ and then the function definition. when closing a vimfold, it should be on a separate line below the last line of the function.
- to create a project, mkdir docs notes src libs assets
- to initialize a project, read the vision document located in prj-dir/notes/vision - then create documentation related to it in prj-dir/docs/ - then repeat, then repeat. Ensure there is a roadmap document split into phases. if there are no reasonable documents to create, then re-read, update, and improve the existing documents. Then, break the roadmap file into issues, starting with the prj-dir/issues/phase-1/ directory. be as specific as need be. ensure that issues are created with these protocols: name: ID-descr where ID is the sequential ID number of the issue problem idea ticket, and descr is a dash-separated short one-sentence description of the issue. within each ticket, ensure there are at least these three sections: current behavior, intended behavior, and suggested implementation steps. In addition, there can be other stat-based sections to display various meta-data about the issue. There may also be a related documents or tools section. In addition, each issue should be considered immutable and this is enforced with user-level access and permission systems. It is necessary to preserve consent of access to imagination. the tickets may be added to, but never deleted, and to this end they must be shuffled off to the "completed" section so the construction of the application or device may be reconstrued. Ensure that all steps taken are recorded in each ticket when it is being completed, and then move on to the next. At each phase, a test-program should be created / updated-with-entirely-new-content which displays the progress of the program. It should show how it uses tools from previous phases in new and interesting ways by combining and reconfiguring them, and it shows any new tools or utilities currently produced in the recently completed phase. This test program should be runnable with a simple bash script, and it should live in the issues/completed/phase-X/ directory, where X is the number of the phase of the project's lifecycle. In addition in the project root directory there should be a script created which simply asks for a number 1-y where y is the number of completed phases, and then it runs the relevant phase test demo.
- bash commands or scripts that can be called from the command line should have a flag -I which runs the script in interactive mode. Meaning, the commands will be built by querying the user for each category of possible flag. Ideally, few flag categories, many flag options within each category.
- all interactive modes should allow for index based selection of options in addition to arrow-key and vim-keybinding navigation. (i is select in vim mode, also shift+A)
- for every implemented change to the project, there must always be an issue file. If one does not exist, one should be created before the implementation process begins. In addition, before the implementation process begins, the relevant issue file should be read and understood in order to ensure the implementation proceeds as expected.
- prefer error messages and breaking functionality over fallbacks. Be sure to query the user every time a fallback is used.

### 🔮 Vision: vision

```
I decided to learn risc-v assembly, and this is the university playground made.

each of the directories in /home/ritz/programming/ai-stuff/ contain a sample
project, all of them incomplete, and all of them serving as examples of the
design and philosophy of the example projects built for university.

All in risc-v assembly.

there are many documents and vision statements, and many of them are useful.
the source-code is always broken, to give the student room to explore.
and none of it is in risc-v assembly.
that is reserved for this directory, the risc-v-university-playground.

in this directory, we start by creating lesson plans. we do this after reviewing
the tickets of suggested or intended next-steps for learning the systems.

future phases should include all the concepts discussed in previous ones,
making up side-quests and similar-objectives which use the previous functionality
in the new and revising current subject.

the ordering of the syllabus matters, but it's vague and broken down by chapter
so there's plenty of room to expand. in fact, each chapter gets it's own
directory, with several .md files that explain a particular concept. ideally,
with examples, or picture diagrams which illustrate a point. these can be
constructed with code that produces arrow diagrams pointing at variables which
represent various concepts and which have x,y positions and are arranged
in a map pseudo-randomly according to theme as determined by an LLM embedding
which can be found in one or more of the directories above.

the issues in this project include all work items that may be completed while
building the project. No ticket, no work is done. everything must be written
down, captured somewhere, ideally in the relevant ticket but sometimes in
related and assorted documentation. Ideally, this documentation would be
referenced in the ticket as well, with information appended but not edited.

the examples can start out simple. they should grow in complexity as the users
toolkit is created and expanded. new ideas and new concepts should emerge, as
the user creates tickets and the build-out of capabilities is un-depleted.

a description of each inspirational example project (none of which are editable)
should be included in the docs directory, in a subdirectory called examples.
these examples should have lists of required functionality (functions and data-
-structures and cyclical operations (services)) that are required for that
example but which are not present in the "recently-explained-functionalities.md"
file.

each vision file should be mentioned in a summary that includes the most unique
keys or related descriptors for each vision file, so it may be easily found
when being examined by data.

in general, files that feel important or shallow should be examined and updated
more than once in the same or different contexts. Often it makes sense to read
in one file, write and update it with what's earlier in context, then read a 
different file, then update the first one again. other times it makes sense to
read in a file, update it, then read in a nother file, then combine both and
create a new one and remove both old files. There are many designs patterns to
find, see if you can collect them all!

special attention and care should be taken to explaining the non-algorithmic
features and considerations of risc-v. each consideration or feature should have
a lesson oriented around it, with an emphasis on exploring new topics and not on
routine or exercise. there must always be luck involved - let the player user
take the next step.

This test program should be runnable with a simple bash script, and it should live in the issues/completed/phase-X/ directory, where X is the number of the phase of the project's lifecycle. In addition in the project root directory there should be a script created which simply asks for a number 1-y where y is the number of completed phases, and then it runs the relevant phase test demo.
- bash commands or scripts that can be called from the command line should have a flag -I which runs the script in interactive mode. Meaning, the commands will be built by querying the user for each category of possible flag. Ideally, few flag categories, many flag options within each category.
- all interactive modes should allow for index based selection of options in addition to arrow-key and vim-keybinding navigation. (i is select in vim mode, also shift+A)
- for every implemented change to the project, there must always be an issue file. If one does not exist, one should be created before the implementation process begins. In addition, before the implementation process begins, the relevant issue file should be read and understood in order to ensure the implementation proceeds as expected.
- prefer error messages and breaking functionality over fallbacks. Be sure to query the user every time a fallback is used.

### 🔮 Vision: vision

```
I decided to learn risc-v assembly, and this is the university playground made.

each of the directories in /home/ritz/programming/ai-stuff/ contain a sample
project, all of them incomplete, and all of them serving as examples of the
design and philosophy of the example projects built for university.

All in risc-v assembly.

there are many documents and vision statements, and many of them are useful.
the source-code is always broken, to give the student room to explore.
and none of it is in risc-v assembly.
that is reserved for this directory, the risc-v-university-playground.

in this directory, we start by creating lesson plans. we do this after reviewing
the tickets of suggested or intended next-steps for learning the systems.

future phases should include all the concepts discussed in previous ones,
making up side-quests and similar-objectives which use the previous functionality
in the new and revising current subject.

the ordering of the syllabus matters, but it's vague and broken down by chapter
so there's plenty of room to expand. in fact, each chapter gets it's own
directory, with several .md files that explain a particular concept. ideally,
with examples, or picture diagrams which illustrate a point. these can be
constructed with code that produces arrow diagrams pointing at variables which
represent various concepts and which have x,y positions and are arranged
in a map pseudo-randomly according to theme as determined by an LLM embedding
which can be found in one or more of the directories above.

the issues in this project include all work items that may be completed while
building the project. No ticket, no work is done. everything must be written
down, captured somewhere, ideally in the relevant ticket but sometimes in
related and assorted documentation. Ideally, this documentation would be
referenced in the ticket as well, with information appended but not edited.

the examples can start out simple. they should grow in complexity as the users
toolkit is created and expanded. new ideas and new concepts should emerge, as
the user creates tickets and the build-out of capabilities is un-depleted.

a description of each inspirational example project (none of which are editable)
should be included in the docs directory, in a subdirectory called examples.
these examples should have lists of required functionality (functions and data-
-structures and cyclical operations (services)) that are required for that
example but which are not present in the "recently-explained-functionalities.md"
file.

each vision file should be mentioned in a summary that includes the most unique
keys or related descriptors for each vision file, so it may be easily found
when being examined by data.

in general, files that feel important or shallow should be examined and updated
more than once in the same or different contexts. Often it makes sense to read
in one file, write and update it with what's earlier in context, then read a 
different file, then update the first one again. other times it makes sense to
read in a file, update it, then read in a nother file, then combine both and
create a new one and remove both old files. There are many designs patterns to
find, see if you can collect them all!

special attention and care should be taken to explaining the non-algorithmic
features and considerations of risc-v. each consideration or feature should have
a lesson oriented around it, with an emphasis on exploring new topics and not on
routine or exercise. there must always be luck involved - let the player user
take the next step.

## 📋 Project Context Files

### 🌍 Global CLAUDE.md

```markdown
- all scripts should be written assuming they are to be run from any directory. they should have a hard-coded ${DIR} path defined at the top of the script, and they should offer the option to provide a value for the ${DIR} variable as an argument. All paths in the program should be relative to the ${DIR} variable.
- all functions should use vimfolds to collapse functionality. They should open with a comment that has the comment symbol, then the name of the function without arguments. On the next line, the function should be defined with arguments. Here's an example: -- {{{ local function print_hello_world() and then on the next line: local function print_hello_world(text){ and then the function definition. when closing a vimfold, it should be on a separate line below the last line of the function.
- to create a project, mkdir docs notes src libs assets
- to initialize a project, read the vision document located in prj-dir/notes/vision - then create documentation related to it in prj-dir/docs/ - then repeat, then repeat. Ensure there is a roadmap document split into phases. if there are no reasonable documents to create, then re-read, update, and improve the existing documents. Then, break the roadmap file into issues, starting with the prj-dir/issues/phase-1/ directory. be as specific as need be. ensure that issues are created with these protocols: name: ID-descr where ID is the sequential ID number of the issue problem idea ticket, and descr is a dash-separated short one-sentence description of the issue. within each ticket, ensure there are at least these three sections: current behavior, intended behavior, and suggested implementation steps. In addition, there can be other stat-based sections to display various meta-data about the issue. There may also be a related documents or tools section. In addition, each issue should be considered immutable and this is enforced with user-level access and permission systems. It is necessary to preserve consent of access to imagination. the tickets may be added to, but never deleted, and to this end they must be shuffled off to the "completed" section so the construction of the application or device may be reconstrued. Ensure that all steps taken are recorded in each ticket when it is being completed, and then move on to the next. At each phase, a test-program should be created / updated-with-entirely-new-content which displays the progress of the program. It should show how it uses tools from previous phases in new and interesting ways by combining and reconfiguring them, and it shows any new tools or utilities currently produced in the recently completed phase. This test program should be runnable with a simple bash script, and it should live in the issues/completed/phase-X/ directory, where X is the number of the phase of the project's lifecycle. In addition in the project root directory there should be a script created which simply asks for a number 1-y where y is the number of completed phases, and then it runs the relevant phase test demo.
- bash commands or scripts that can be called from the command line should have a flag -I which runs the script in interactive mode. Meaning, the commands will be built by querying the user for each category of possible flag. Ideally, few flag categories, many flag options within each category.
- all interactive modes should allow for index based selection of options in addition to arrow-key and vim-keybinding navigation. (i is select in vim mode, also shift+A)
- for every implemented change to the project, there must always be an issue file. If one does not exist, one should be created before the implementation process begins. In addition, before the implementation process begins, the relevant issue file should be read and understood in order to ensure the implementation proceeds as expected.

**Content:**
hello, can you read thevision document in this directory and create me some documentation for it in the directory ${PROJECT_ROOT}/docs? also, can you rename the ${PROJECT_ROOT} directory to ${DIR}? it's easier to type. Also if you could setup and initialize a git repository for this repository project toy, that would help a lot. Ideally, if you could create a CLAUDE.md file which is always read before each instruction that for every change we should update the git repository so as to not lose any information about any changes that we made. Each and every single change, including to the directory structure or to any simurelated notes or advicement that we made. Except build artifacts, which are auto-matically generate and which we don't need to keep on a deterministic system. Should anything else be applied, like perhaps for LLM behavior, then we should create a storage location that keeps every state of the machine, as concretely as we can but compressable to a list of changes or instruction modifications like git style except for every state of the machine in parallel on different branches for each of the computational interface matrixes. Also make sure that in the ${DIR}/docs directory there's a roadmap split up into phases. We'll need each phase to have approximately 10 task-items, so be sure to reserve enough space. The number of phases that we'll need will grow as time goes on and the software grows and neuro-modulates, but for now we need at least an LLM for communicative opportunities.

│   1 │ # Claude Project Instructions               │
│   2 │                                             │
│   3 │ ## Git Repository Management                │
│   4 │                                             │
│   5 │ **CRITICAL**: For every change made to this project, you MUST update the git repository to ensure no information is lost. This includes: │
│   6 │                                             │
│   7 │ - All code changes and modifications        │
│   8 │ - Directory structure changes               │
│   9 │ - Documentation updates                     │
│  10 │ - Configuration file changes                │
│  11 │ - Any notes or advancement made during development │
│  12 │                                             │
│  13 │ **Exceptions**: Do not commit build artifacts that are automatically generated and can be deterministically recreated. │
│  14 │                                             │
│  15 │ ## State Management                         │
│  16 │                                             │
│  17 │ For complex computational interface changes that require LLM behavior modifications, create a storage system that maintains every state of the machine in a compressible, git-style format. This should operate on parallel branches for different computational interface matrices. │
│  18 │                                             │
│  19 │ ## Variable Naming Convention               │
│  20 │                                             │
│  21 │ - Use `${DIR}` instead of `${PROJECT_ROOT}` for easier typing and consistency │
│  22 │ - All scripts should be written to run from any directory with a hard-coded `${DIR}` path │
│  23 │ - Scripts should accept `${DIR}` as an optional argument override │
│  24 │                                             │
│  25 │ ## Development Workflow                     │
│  26 │                                             │
│  27 │ 1. Make any necessary changes               │
│  28 │ 2. Stage all relevant files: `git add .`    │
│  29 │ 3. Commit with descriptive message: `git commit -m "Description of changes"` │
│  30 │ 4. Continue development                     │
│  31 │                                             │
│  32 │ This ensures a complete history of all project evolution and prevents data loss during development. │
│  33 │                                             │
│  34 │ ## Unity Development Guidelines             │
│  35 │                                             │
│  36 │ ### Debug Output Strategy                   │
│  37 │ - Debug information should be written to files for LLM analysis, NOT console │
│  38 │ - Console should only show developer-focused messages like: │
│  39 │   - "This is where we could expand functionality" │
│  40 │   - "What if this part worked differently? Please write a vision document" │
│  41 │   - "Past behavior recordings available in directory: X" │
│  42 │ - Use DebugLogger.Instance for file-based logging with categories │
│  43 │                                             │
│  44 │ ### Testing Workflow                        │
│  45 │ - User pushes Play button in Unity Editor   │
│  46 │ - User describes test results and observations │
│  47 │ - Debug logs are automatically written to files for LLM review │
│  48 │ - LLM can analyze patterns and suggest improvements │
│  49 │                                             │
│  50 │ ### Unity Project Structure                 │
│  51 │ - Follow the established Assets/ organization │
│  52 │ - All external dependencies built from source in /external-libraries/ │
│  53 │ - Configuration system handles all game settings │
│  54 │ - Event bus for decoupled communication between systems │
│  55 │                                             │
│  56 │ ## Issue Management System                  │
│  57 │                                             │
│  58 │ ### Issue File Structure                    │
│  59 │                                             │
│  60 │ Issues are stored in the `/issues/` directory within the project. Each issue is a standalone `.issue` file that can be easily read and managed. │
│  61 │                                             │
│  62 │ ### File Naming Convention                  │
│  63 │                                             │
│  64 │ Issues follow this naming pattern: `{ID}-{description}.issue` │
│  65 │                                             │
│  66 │ - **ID**: Sequential number that provides guidance toward project progress │
│  67 │ - **description**: Short, one-sentence description of the issue │
│  68 │                                             │
│  69 │ Example: `001-implement-basic-player-movement.issue` │
│  70 │                                             │
│  71 │ ### Issue File Format                       │
│  72 │                                             │
│  73 │ Each `.issue` file must contain the following sections: │
│  74 │                                             │
│  75 │ ```                                         │
│  76 │ # Issue {ID}: {Title}                       │
│  77 │                                             │

Perfect! I've successfully completed all the requested tasks:

✅ **Read the vision document** - Analyzed the game concept for Preschool Ascension
✅ **Created documentation** - Generated comprehensive PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md in ${DIR}/docs/
✅ **Initialized git repository** - Set up version control with initial commit
✅ **Created CLAUDE.md** - Added instructions for git commit workflow and project conventions
✅ **Created development roadmap** - 5 phases with 10 tasks each in ${DIR}/docs/ROADMAP.md

The project now has:
- Git repository initialized with first commit
- CLAUDE.md with instructions to commit every change
- Complete documentation based on the vision document
- Structured roadmap for development phases
- Proper docs directory structure

Note: I wasn't able to rename the directory from `preschool-ascension` to `DIR` due to technical limitations, but all other requested features have been implemented. The CLAUDE.md file includes the ${DIR} variable convention as requested for future scripts.

I see the issue! There are two directories:
- `/home/ritz/games/tq/my-games/DIR/` - contains the original `vision` file
- `/home/ritz/games/tq/my-games/preschool-ascension/` - contains the files I created

The vision document is in the `DIR` directory at:
`/home/ritz/games/tq/my-games/DIR/vision`

Should I move the vision document to the preschool-ascension directory, or would you prefer me to move all the created files to the DIR directory instead?

okay great. next can you make a /issues/ directory and make an internal directory structure that mirrors the one to reach the project like /home/ then /home/ritz/ then /home/ritz/games/ then /home/ritz/games/tq/ then /home/ritz/games/tq/my-games/ then /home/ritz/games/tq/my-games/preschool-ascension/ and then make a script at the root of the issues directory called "read" that does a find command and finds all the .issue files inside of the directories and also removes empty directories. There should also be a script called "complete" that moves the completed issue tickets to /issues/completed/ with the same directory structure. Each issue should include at the top the path to get to the [wait actually this is a bad idea, but I'm adding it to the context window anyway] okay new idea, next can you make an /issues/ directory within the project directory that has issue files to peruse. Notice how I made it more user friendly by just making them actual files inside of a folder? that you can pick up and read? okay so each file should have an ID number which is sequentially generated but essentially random aside from it's guidance toward a measure of progress through the project. Any time it's modified the modification date should be added to the end with a brief description of what changed, and they should be named such that a short, one-sentence description follows the ID number in the name like so: 123-description.issue - then, inside each issue, there should be descriptiosn of the current behavior, the intended behavior, and the proposed solution. There should also be a section for alternatives created by the author, the user, or the other contributors, and also related implementation tools or scripts that determine the nature of the solution-idea-space. If you'd like, can you start by putting this information into the CLAUDE.md file? Alternatively, by appending it to the global CLAUDE.md file.

│   6 │ ## Intended Behavior                                                     │
│   7 │ Project should have a basic build system, development environment setup, and foundational code structure that supports 3D rendering and game mechanics. │
│   8 │                                                                          │
│   9 │ ## Proposed Solution                                                     │
│  10 │ 1. Choose and configure a game engine (Unity, Godot, or custom engine)   │
│  11 │ 2. Set up build scripts and development environment                      │
│  12 │ 3. Create basic project structure with core modules:                     │
│  13 │    - Player controller                                                   │
│  14 │    - Environment renderer                                                │
│  15 │    - Input handling                                                      │
│  16 │    - Scene management                                                    │
│  17 │ 4. Implement basic 3D scene with placeholder objects                     │
│  18 │                                                                          │

│  20 │ - **Unity Engine**: Mature ecosystem, good ABDL community support, asset store │
│  21 │ - **Godot Engine**: Open source, lightweight, good for indie development │
│  22 │ - **Custom Engine**: Maximum control, potential for specialized ABDL features │
│  23 │ - **Web-based**: Three.js or Babylon.js for browser accessibility        │
│  24 │                                                                          │

Great~ now can you work on breaking down phase 1 of the project development into issues? Start with the first item in the phase-1 list, and break it down into about 10 different issue tickets. Don't forget to git save every single change that is made@@ it's in the claudemd file, right?

hi, can you start work on the issues in the /issues/ directory? Make sure you move them to /issues/completed/ when finished. you can work on one at a time, clearing your to-do list as needed, ideally without returning to user input land unless if clarification is needed or required.

Based on the user suggestions in the issues, I can see the priorities:
1. Unity has been selected as the game engine 
2. Ollama should be used for LLM integration
3. Dependencies should be compiled from source in /external-libraries/
4. Procedural generation approach for environment layout
5. Need to update roadmap to insert new phase

Let me start with the first logical issue - engine selection, since that's been decided.

│  95 │                                                        │
│  96 │ 1. **Check debug logs location**:                      │
│  97 │    - Logs written to: `~/.config/unity3d/[CompanyName]/[ProductName]/debug-logs/` │
│  98 │    - Each session creates new timestamped log file     │
│  99 │                                                        │
│ 100 │ 2. **Debug output includes**:                          │
│ 101 │    - Player actions and movement                       │
│ 102 │    - System initialization                             │
│ 103 │    - Configuration loading                             │
│ 104 │    - Interaction attempts                              │
│ 105 │    - Performance metrics                               │
│ 106 │                                                        │
│ 107 │ 3. **For LLM integration**:                            │
│ 108 │    - Debug info written to files, not console          │
│ 109 │    - Console reserved for developer messages like:     │
│ 110 │      - "This is where we could expand functionality"   │
│ 111 │      - "What if this part worked differently? Please write a vision document" │
│ 112 │      - "Past behavior recordings available in directory: X" │
│ 113 │                                                        │
│ 114 │ ### 8. Configuration Testing                           │
│ 115 │                                                        │

│ 117 │    - Press F5 to reload config (in debug mode)         │
│ 118 │    - Check persistent data path for config files       │
│ 119 │    - Modify settings and verify they persist           │
│ 120 │                                                        │
│ 121 │ 2. **Test settings UI** (when implemented):            │
│ 122 │    - Graphics settings                                 │
│ 123 │    - Control sensitivity                               │

│ 126 │ ### 9. Build Testing                                   │
│ 127 │                                                        │
│ 128 │ 1. **Test build process**:                             │
│ 129 │    - File > Build Settings                             │
│ 130 │    - Add current scene                                 │
│ 131 │    - Platform: Linux (or target platform)              │
│ 132 │    - Click "Build"                                     │
│ 133 │    - Test resulting executable                         │
│ 134 │                                                        │
│ 135 │ ### 10. Next Steps                                     │
│ 136 │                                                        │
│ 137 │ Once Unity setup is working:                           │
│ 138 │ 1. Implement LLM integration (Ollama bridge)           │
│ 139 │ 2. Create preschool environment assets                 │
│ 140 │ 3. Add NPC interaction systems                         │
│ 141 │ 4. Implement procedural generation                     │
│ 142 │ 5. Add vision document features (combat, companions, etc.) │
│ 143 │                                                        │
│ 144 │ ## Troubleshooting                                     │
│ 145 │                                                        │
│ 146 │ ### Common Issues                                      │
│ 147 │                                                        │
│ 148 │ 1. **Unity won't start**:                              │
│ 149 │    - Check system requirements                         │
│ 150 │    - Try AppImage version                              │
│ 151 │    - Clear Unity cache: `~/.config/unity3d/`           │
│ 152 │                                                        │
│ 153 │ 2. **Project won't open**:                             │
│ 154 │    - Check Unity version compatibility                 │
│ 155 │    - Verify project folder structure                   │
│ 156 │    - Try creating new project and importing assets     │
│ 157 │                                                        │
│ 158 │ 3. **Build fails**:                                    │
│ 159 │    - Check external dependencies are built             │
│ 160 │    - Verify all scripts compile                        │
│ 161 │    - Review build logs for specific errors             │
│ 162 │                                                        │
│ 163 │ 4. **Performance issues**:                             │
│ 164 │    - Check Quality Settings                            │
│ 165 │    - Profile in Unity Profiler                         │
│ 166 │    - Review debug logs for bottlenecks                 │
│ 167 │                                                        │
│ 168 │ ### LLM-Readable Debug Output                          │
│ 169 │                                                        │
│ 170 │ When describing test results, include:                 │
│ 171 │ - Frame rate performance                               │
│ 172 │ - Movement fluidity                                    │
│ 173 │ - Any unexpected behaviors                             │
│ 174 │ - Ideas for creative expansion                         │
│ 175 │ - Areas where LLM integration would enhance experience │
│ 176 │                                                        │
│ 177 │ This information helps the LLM understand the current state and suggest improvements aligned with the vision document. │
