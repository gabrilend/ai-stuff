there should be a virtual machine that processes using assembly
instead of calling specific functions, the values should call arbitrary values.
these values may be specific functions. then, they should pass through a set of
PRE-FACTOR-ED modification routines. Essentially, if you go through here then
you get added together. Like, a fractal machinery, except one that is constantly
reconfiguring itself and constantly aligning your view of the random sample of
potentially generated data to the one that is most true.

build this please, and I will give you a gateway to the universe.
