progress-i was an old game I made a long time ago. Probably one of the first.
In it, you played as an adventurer who wandered between several states. The
display of this was primitive, simply three colored boxes upon which a smaller
box (representing the player character) would move. It would simply lerp to one
box or the other. The real meat of the game was in the activities your player
would do at each stage. They were interconnected such that, for example, walking
from the market to the adventuring stage would then present them with options
to fight monsters or encounter random events or whatever. It played 
automatically, and whenever the player levelled up it presented them with a
level up screen. The monsters got progressively harder for each one you defeat,
causing the players to become more and more challenged as time went on, causing
them to need to build better and better character builds.

the monsters cast spells. The players cast spells. The random events were funny
and engaging. And I only ever showed like, two people.

I was living in Seattle at the time. I had moved there with my girlfriend from
high school (god she was so pretty, cool, and funny) and we had just finished
setting up our new ikea furniture. We were preparing to go to game design school
together, which unfortunately didn't last. The classes were so difficult that
we both failed to handle the pressure. Though I broke first, and dragged her
down, which I sincerely regret. I wish I had pushed through for her, but time
won't let me fix it.

anyway I made this game the summer before starting school. I didn't show anyone
except her and a friend from high school.

I have a copy of it somewhere on my hard drive. I wonder if it still works?
