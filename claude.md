use git for every change, no matter how minor

save text transcripts of all communication about it, and use it to build the
documentation.

build libraries locally, and keep a copy for each computer it might locally be
installed upon. quite easy, just moving a directory. [folder, they say folder]

try and write your own abstract scripts. once you have a category, make one
category for each type of thing. split a group in two and describe one one way
and the other the other. then it's just a matter of memorizing config flags and
bam, all your scripting needs are you-dling.

why not let a computer design itself? that's kinda what it means to be human.

use rust, bash, and lua. rust for efficiency, lua for orchestration,
      and bash for gluing it all together.

use static HTML pages. Don't use javascript or CSS. If you need it, HTML5, but
that's a whole program on it's own, just accessed from the web.

not streamed, but copied, streamed virtual-machine-instructions style.

there was this game... Overwatch... when they saved a recording of the match, it
was like, all they had to do was recall the movements and they could recreate
the whole scene. It was beautiful!

I want to make a feeling like that. the idea that software can be.. just bits??
that we can do whatever we want with??

like sure yeah there's 500 wheat fields over there, now hwere's a dragon and a
                                                                       stormin'

text on the gameboy advanced should be right justified, with only the first
line reaching across the page.
                              it should form an L shape, except... a line across
                              the top and down the right side.
                              then, the next line,
                                                  displayed along the left-side
                                                  and then the bottom.
                              when vertical, the shape should be of a
                                                                      line, so
                                                                      one
                                                                      word
                                                                      per
                                                                      line.
                                                                      then, line

then, the next line, when the user moves on, is displayed in mirrored fashion.

if you wanted you could buy up an entire subdivision as it was being built and
put whatever kind of infrastructure inside of it you want. rockets, spaceships,
heck you could even turn it into a massive clock. [probably easiest with robots]

... right as I was saying, you can backup conversation transcripts with this
bash command:

```bash
source /home/ritz/scripts/claude && backup-conversations
```
this will put the relevant text information into the project directory in
/llm-transcripts/.
