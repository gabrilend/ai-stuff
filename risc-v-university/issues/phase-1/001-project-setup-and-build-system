# Issue 001: Project Setup and Build System

## Current Behavior
No build system or project structure exists for the RISC-V University platform.

## Intended Behavior
A complete project setup with build system, dependency management, and development environment configuration should be established.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Initialize package.json with project dependencies
2. Set up build system (webpack/vite/rollup)
3. Configure development server with hot reload
4. Set up linting and code formatting (ESLint, Prettier)
5. Configure TypeScript compilation
6. Set up testing framework (Jest/Vitest)
7. Create development and production build scripts
8. Set up environment configuration

## Priority
High

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Dependencies
None
