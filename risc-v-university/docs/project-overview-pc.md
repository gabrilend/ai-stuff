# RISC-V University - Personal Playground (PC) Version

## Project Overview
A personal learning playground for exploring RISC-V assembly programming through hands-on experimentation and incremental skill building.

## Philosophy
- **Exploration over routine:** Emphasize discovery and new concepts rather than repetitive exercises
- **Broken by design:** Source code intentionally incomplete to encourage student exploration
- **Iterative learning:** Each phase builds upon previous concepts while introducing new challenges
- **Luck and discovery:** Always leave room for serendipitous learning moments

## Learning Approach

### Ticket-Driven Development
- Every work item requires a corresponding issue ticket
- No work done without proper documentation
- Tickets are immutable records moved to "completed" sections
- Comprehensive step recording during implementation

### Chapter-Based Structure
- Each concept gets its own directory with multiple .md files
- Visual diagrams and examples illustrate key points
- Arrow diagrams with x,y positioned variables
- LLM embedding-based thematic arrangement

### Progressive Complexity
- Start with simple examples
- Grow complexity as toolkit expands
- New ideas emerge from capability build-out
- Side-quests and similar objectives using previous functionality

## Architecture

### Directory Structure
```
src-pc/           # Personal playground source code
libs-pc/          # Personal learning libraries
assets-pc/        # Learning resources and diagrams
issues-pc/        # Personal learning tickets
chapters/         # Concept-based learning modules
examples/         # Inspirational project references
```

### Example Projects Integration
- Reference incomplete projects from /home/ritz/programming/ai-stuff/
- Extract required functionality lists
- Document missing capabilities in "recently-explained-functionalities.md"
- Use as inspiration rather than direct implementation

## Non-Algorithmic Focus
Special emphasis on explaining RISC-V features and considerations that go beyond pure algorithms:
- Instruction encoding and decoding nuances
- Register usage conventions
- Memory access patterns
- Pipeline considerations
- Interrupt handling concepts
- System-level programming aspects

## Learning Methodology
- **Pattern collection:** Identify and document design patterns encountered
- **Iterative refinement:** Re-read and update important files multiple times
- **Context switching:** Read, update, combine files in different contexts
- **Discovery orientation:** Let the learner take the next step with guidance

## Success Metrics
- Depth of understanding achieved
- Number of concepts successfully explored
- Ability to recognize and apply patterns
- Confidence in RISC-V assembly programming
- Enjoyment and engagement with the learning process
