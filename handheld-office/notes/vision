imagine a text editor word document but on a gameboy advance SP.
the typing would work like this: there'd be a hierarchical tree, maybe 2 or 3
layers deep that you could navigate through with an 8 way radial menu controlled
with the D-pad. The user could push A or B and it'd pick between one of two
options at that intersection, maybe L and R too but I think they should be for
switching to a different keyboard with like, emoticons and visual effects.

then, anyone you're talking to would just receive a big stream of text and
emojis. nobody would use it for writing stalin.

or maybe each L and R shoulder button could be another option like A and B, and
double or quadruple I forget the number of options. Could even require both,
so it's encoded like LA or BR

then it'd write it to a notepad, and any of your friends (connected to wifi)
could see it pop up on their screen.

would be cool if you could customize the icons or messages. So, a unique control
style suited to performing a unique task. We only have ONE WAY of typing after
all...

also, it'd be on a notepad, so you could scroll through it.

could even connect to your computer over LAN wifi or LAN ethernet and interface
with it there. Would just need ~~SSH FOREWORDING~~ NO! bad prophet, no misbelieving.
it shouldn't be SSH forewording, it should just be X11 protocol receiving. Like,
instructions to a different type of compositor. Except it's a display manager
I think? Like i3 or something - no no it's a running shell, see here's this
picture of a shell with legs [no confusing her, she's still learning.]

why don't we just treat the LAN as the computer and run everything over the
network? I'd sure pay for faster bandwidth. Maybe more high quality routers...

anyway, *prophet*, how about this?

paint program, but you can only draw lines.
slow, at first, until you get the angle right,
then fast until you let go or reach the max.
then, it can be wiggled around with A and B
and rotated around with L and R (only one point of the two in the line would
orbit, the other would stay fixed, like raising or lowering the slice of a pie

       __
    _*`  |
  _*     |
/`_______|

or another one that magically turned any paint-drawing into ascii
to put it in text-boxes, queering the normative

each character is like a stencil that is used with different strokes
with paint, you only get what, 16 colors?

*excellent*, limitations breed creativity.
besides, the goal is to make these quickly and ad-hoc.

could have an achievement system, like "added tentacles to 2 different bears"
