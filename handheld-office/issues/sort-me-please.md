steam hardware x4
design the next generation
"steam deck mini"
with handheld office OS
and all steam games that can run on it
and a new badge in steam "mini certified" if it works
comes with two screens
and a dedicated input flip switch
because it's actually two computers, synced with one-way ethernet cabling
and input wired to both
here's a demo running on an anbernic
it's only one board, so, this isn't an OS it's a portmaster game... but it's
just a prototype
the real one needs mega engineering
oh it also can take calls on any electromagnetic spectrum
and send on most
some are reserved for like, national use and such
or like, air traffic safety controller radio or such

"they aren't getting layed off, they're just being replaced"

bonus: hand tracking could be faster than a keyboard if you treat the motion
assessment design as a martial artistry with all five fingers if desired,
usually for intensity or change of sign. [binary registers as scale rather than
encoding-ment]
