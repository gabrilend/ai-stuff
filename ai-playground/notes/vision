# AI Playground Vision Document

## Project Overview
An interactive Love2d-based visualization tool for understanding neural network training processes, specifically focusing on gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms.

## Core Objectives
1. **Educational Visualization**: Create an intuitive visual representation of neural networks that shows the flow of data, weights, and gradients
2. **Interactive Learning**: Allow users to modify network parameters, weights, and activation functions in real-time
3. **Step-by-Step Training**: Provide granular control over the training process, enabling step-by-step execution of forward pass, loss calculation, and backpropagation
4. **Formula Transparency**: Display and allow modification of mathematical formulas used in each step of the training process

## Target Features
- Visual representation of neurons with adjustable weights and biases
- Real-time modification of network parameters through GUI controls
- Step-by-step execution controls (pause, step forward, step backward)
- Live display of gradients, loss values, and parameter updates
- Customizable activation functions and loss functions
- Interactive formula editing for mathematical operations
- Visual gradient flow during backpropagation
- Training data visualization and manipulation

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: Love2d (Lua-based game engine)
- **Graphics**: 2D visualization with clear neuron representations
- **Interactivity**: Mouse and keyboard controls for parameter adjustment
- **Performance**: Real-time updates without lag
- **Modularity**: Clean separation between neural network logic and visualization

## Educational Goals
- Demystify the "black box" of neural network training
- Provide hands-on understanding of gradient descent optimization
- Illustrate the mathematical foundations of backpropagation
- Enable experimentation with different network architectures and parameters
- Foster intuitive understanding of how neural networks learn

## Success Metrics
- Users can visually track how gradients flow backward through the network
- Parameter changes result in immediate visual feedback
- Training process can be paused and inspected at any step
- Users can modify formulas and see the impact on network behavior
- Clear visualization of convergence and learning dynamics
