# Issue 002: Implement Basic Neuron Class

## Current Behavior
No neuron implementation exists.

## Intended Behavior
A Neuron class should be implemented with:
- Weights and bias storage
- Forward propagation calculation
- Activation function support
- Basic getter/setter methods for parameters

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Create libs/neural/ directory structure
2. Implement Neuron class with constructor
3. Add weight and bias initialization methods
4. Implement forward propagation method
5. Add support for different activation functions (sigmoid, relu)
6. Create unit tests for neuron functionality

## Priority
High - Core component

## Estimated Effort
4-6 hours

## Dependencies
- Issue 001 (Love2d setup)
