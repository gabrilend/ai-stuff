# Issue 005: Basic Network Visualization

## Current Behavior
No visual representation of neural networks exists.

## Intended Behavior
A basic network renderer should display:
- Neurons as circular nodes
- Connections between neurons as lines
- Basic layout algorithm for positioning nodes
- Simple color coding for different layers

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Create src/visualization/network_renderer.lua
2. Implement basic node positioning algorithm
3. Add circle drawing for neurons
4. Implement line drawing for connections
5. Add basic color scheme for layers
6. Create rendering interface for Network class
7. Integrate with main Love2d rendering loop

## Priority
High - Core visualization requirement

## Estimated Effort
6-8 hours

## Dependencies
- Issue 001 (Love2d setup)
- Issue 003 (Network class)
