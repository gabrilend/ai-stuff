# Issue 001: Setup Love2d Project Structure

## Current Behavior
No Love2d project exists. The basic directory structure has been created but no Love2d-specific files are present.

## Intended Behavior
A functional Love2d project should be set up with:
- main.lua entry point
- Basic Love2d callbacks implemented
- Window configuration
- Basic rendering loop

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Create main.lua with Love2d callbacks (love.load, love.update, love.draw)
2. Set up window configuration (resolution, title)
3. Implement basic rendering system
4. Test that Love2d can run the project successfully
5. Create conf.lua for Love2d configuration

## Priority
High - Foundation requirement

## Estimated Effort
2-4 hours

## Dependencies
None
