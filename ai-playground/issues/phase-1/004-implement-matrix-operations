# Issue 004: Implement Matrix Operations Library

## Current Behavior
No mathematical foundation exists for neural network computations.

## Intended Behavior
A Matrix operations library should provide:
- Basic matrix arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply)
- Matrix transpose operations
- Element-wise operations
- Matrix creation and initialization utilities

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Create libs/math/matrix.lua
2. Implement Matrix constructor and basic properties
3. Add arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
4. Implement transpose and other common operations
5. Add element-wise function application
6. Create utility functions for matrix creation
7. Add validation and error handling

## Priority
High - Required for network calculations

## Estimated Effort
4-6 hours

## Dependencies
None
