# Issue 006: Activation Functions Library

## Current Behavior
No activation function implementations exist.

## Intended Behavior
An activation functions library should provide:
- Common activation functions (sigmoid, ReLU, tanh)
- Derivative calculations for backpropagation
- Function registration system for easy extension
- Numerical stability considerations

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Create libs/neural/activation_functions.lua
2. Implement sigmoid function and its derivative
3. Implement ReLU function and its derivative  
4. Implement tanh function and its derivative
5. Create function registry system
6. Add numerical stability improvements
7. Create activation function selector interface

## Priority
Medium - Required for functional neurons

## Estimated Effort
3-4 hours

## Dependencies
- Issue 002 (Neuron class)
