# Issue 003: Implement Network Class

## Current Behavior
No network implementation exists to organize neurons into layers.

## Intended Behavior
A Network class should be implemented with:
- Layer management system
- Network topology definition
- Forward pass through entire network
- Input/output handling

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Create Network class in libs/neural/network.lua
2. Implement layer addition methods
3. Add network topology validation
4. Implement forward pass through all layers
5. Create methods for network state inspection
6. Add network serialization/deserialization support

## Priority
High - Core component

## Estimated Effort
6-8 hours

## Dependencies
- Issue 002 (Neuron class)
