### Running the Application
```bash
love ./ai-playground
```
or
```bash
cd ai-playground
love .
```

## Interface Overview

### Main Window Layout
- **Left Panel**: Neural network visualization area
- **Right Panel**: Parameter controls and formula editors
- **Bottom Panel**: Training controls and status information
- **Top Panel**: Menu bar with save/load options

## Core Features

### 1. Network Visualization
- **Neurons**: Circular nodes representing individual neurons
- **Connections**: Lines between neurons showing weights (thickness = magnitude)
- **Data Flow**: Animated particles showing information flow during forward pass
- **Gradient Flow**: Color-coded arrows showing gradient direction during backpropagation

### 2. Interactive Parameter Editing
- **Weight Sliders**: Drag to adjust connection weights in real-time
- **Bias Controls**: Modify neuron bias values
- **Learning Rate**: Adjust the speed of parameter updates
- **Activation Functions**: Dropdown to select different activation functions

### 3. Training Controls
- **Play/Pause**: Start or stop the training process
- **Step Forward**: Execute one training iteration
- **Step Backward**: Undo last training step (limited history)
- **Reset**: Return network to initial state

### 4. Formula Editing
- **Activation Functions**: Edit mathematical expressions for neuron activation
- **Loss Functions**: Customize how error is calculated
- **Custom Derivatives**: Define gradient calculations for custom functions

## Step-by-Step Training Walkthrough

### Phase 1: Forward Pass
1. Click "Step Forward" to begin
2. Watch input data propagate through the network
3. Observe how each neuron processes its inputs
4. See the final output and loss calculation

### Phase 2: Loss Calculation
1. View the difference between predicted and target output
2. Understand how the loss function quantifies the error
3. See the initial gradient of the loss with respect to output

### Phase 3: Backpropagation
1. Watch gradients flow backward through the network
2. Observe how each layer's gradients are calculated
3. See the chain rule in action as gradients combine

### Phase 4: Parameter Updates
1. View how gradients affect weight and bias updates
2. See the learning rate's effect on update magnitude
3. Observe the network's new state after updates

## Common Use Cases

### Experimenting with Learning Rates
1. Set a high learning rate (e.g., 0.1)
2. Observe oscillating or divergent behavior
3. Reduce learning rate (e.g., 0.01) for stable convergence

### Understanding Activation Functions
1. Start with sigmoid activation
2. Switch to ReLU and observe differences
3. Create custom activation functions

### Visualizing Gradient Issues
1. Create a deep network (5+ layers)
2. Use sigmoid activation throughout
3. Observe vanishing gradients in early layers

## Tips and Best Practices

### For Beginners
- Start with a simple 2-layer network
- Use the step-by-step mode extensively
- Focus on understanding one concept at a time

### For Advanced Users
- Experiment with custom activation functions
- Try different optimization algorithms
- Create complex network architectures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Network not learning**: Check learning rate and data scaling
- **Exploding gradients**: Reduce learning rate or add gradient clipping
- **Slow performance**: Reduce network size or disable animations

### Performance Tips
- Disable animations for large networks
- Use simplified visualization mode for better performance
- Save configurations to avoid re-setup
