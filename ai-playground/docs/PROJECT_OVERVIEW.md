# AI Playground - Project Overview

## What Is This?

The AI Playground is a **comprehensive neural network visualization and analysis system** that transforms abstract machine learning concepts into **intuitive, interactive, visual experiences**. It combines cutting-edge 3D visualization with AI-powered narration to make neural networks understandable at a deep, intuitive level.

## Core Innovation: Mind-Heart Encoding

The project's central breakthrough is the **stereographic 3D visualization** that enables "mind-heart encoding" - the ability to perceive and remember neural network structures as **spatial relationships, icons, and memorable shapes**. This transforms abstract mathematics into concrete visual understanding.
