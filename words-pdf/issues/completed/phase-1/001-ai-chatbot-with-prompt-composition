# Issue 001: AI Chatbot with Prompt Composition

## Current Behavior
No AI chatbot system exists in the current words-pdf project.

## Intended Behavior
Create an AI chatbot system that:
- Composes prompts with 40% previous conversation (user responses only)
- Includes 50% randomly sampled content from words.pdf or compiled.txt
- Appends 10% user's next prompt and system status information
- Uses Ollama for chat interface
- Limits responses to exactly 80 characters
- Provides computation speed feedback when system is idling

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Integrate Ollama chatbot framework into the project
-- partial implementation already complete
2. Create conversation history management system
-- such system already exists, check out the project directory
3. Implement random sampling from compiled.txt content
-- be sure to split on the separation marks. but include them, top and bottom,
   for each submission, to better delineate.
-- make separate issues from this point below
4. Build prompt composition engine with specified percentages
5. Add 80-character response limiting functionality
6. Implement system status monitoring for computation speed
7. Create chat interface with proper formatting
8. Test prompt composition ratios and response length constraints

- Complexity: High
- Dependencies: Ollama, system monitoring tools
- Estimated effort: Large (multiple components)
