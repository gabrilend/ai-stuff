# Issue 003: HTML5-Only Web Interface

## Current Behavior
Current web interface relies on JavaScript for Ollama integration and file processing.

## Intended Behavior
Create a pure HTML5 web interface that:
- Uses only HTML5 features (no JavaScript)
- Provides form-based interaction for chat
- Displays randomized inspiration content statically
- Uses server-side processing for Ollama integration
- Maintains 80-character response formatting

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Create pure HTML5 interface with forms and semantic elements
2. Design server-side script to handle form submissions
3. Implement Lua-based web server for Ollama integration
4. Build static content generation from compiled.txt
5. Create form-based chat flow with page refreshes
6. Implement response length limiting on server side
7. Add CSS-only styling for terminal appearance
