# Issue 002: HTML5 Web Ollama Interface

## Current Behavior
No web interface exists for interacting with Ollama or sampling from input files.

## Intended Behavior
Create an HTML5 web application that:
- Runs Ollama client directly from the browser
- Randomly samples content from compiled.txt for each prompt
- Generates new inspirational content for every user interaction
- Provides real-time web-based chat interface
- Integrates with the prompt composition system from Issue 001

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Create HTML5 base structure with modern web standards
2. Implement JavaScript Ollama client integration
3. Build file reader for compiled.txt with dash-delimiter parsing
4. Create random sampling algorithm for inspiration generation
5. Design responsive chat interface with real-time updates
6. Integrate prompt composition engine (40% conversation, 50% samples, 10% new)
7. Add 80-character response limiting in web interface
8. Test cross-browser compatibility and performance
