# Issue 004: Theme Artwork Patterns

## Current Behavior
The current theming system (if it exists) does not include artwork patterns for tier 2 themes or color associations for tier 3 themes.

## Intended Behavior
Enhance the theming system to include:
- Artwork patterns for tier 2 themes
- Color associations for tier 3 themes
- Integration with embedding-based color assignment
- Pattern and color coordination across theme tiers

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Research existing theme system structure and tiers
2. Define artwork pattern specification format
3. Create pattern generation or selection algorithms
4. Implement tier 3 color association system
5. Integrate with existing embedding-based color assignment
6. Create pattern and color coordination logic
7. Test theme consistency across different content

## Implementation Notes
This appears to build upon existing theming infrastructure. Investigate the current theme system before implementing enhancements.
