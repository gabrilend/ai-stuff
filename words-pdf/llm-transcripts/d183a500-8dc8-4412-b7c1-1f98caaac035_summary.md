### User Request 1

hi, quick issue update, can you add an issue to make it so that the poems are
organized backwards? meaning, the first poem is the last, the last poem is the
first, and the second to first and second to last poems are swapped by going
through an intermediary, etc etc until they get to the middle one (which is
validated by check cross compiling starting at the middle and going to the top
before going to the end and then to the middle) and then they first try writing
to the middle one, and then they evaluate if what the middle one has is their
own, and if so then they take down the alternative if it's different than theirs
and they examine it with their current one and they try to generate a shared
conclusion that includes both of them.

### Assistant Response 1

Created issue 001 for reverse poem ordering with cross-compilation validation at
`/mnt/mtwo/programming/ai-stuff/words-pdf/issues/phase-1/001-reverse-poem-ordering-with-cross-compilation-validation.md`

### User Request 2

can you add an issue that's a toggle button for that one? you should reference
each other in both tickets. toggle button meaning the user can request either or
both.

### Assistant Response 2

Created issue 002 for the poem ordering toggle interface at
`/mnt/mtwo/programming/ai-stuff/words-pdf/issues/phase-1/002-poem-ordering-toggle-interface.md`
and updated issue 001 with cross-references. Both issues now reference each
other properly.
