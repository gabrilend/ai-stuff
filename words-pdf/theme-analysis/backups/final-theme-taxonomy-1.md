## Analysis Notes for Pass 2
- **Resistance** and **Technology** themes overlap significantly and should be expanded into sub-themes exploring techno-politics, digital resistance, and programming as activism
- **Identity** theme needs subdivision into neurodivergence, gender/sexuality, and authenticity categories
- **Connection** and **Isolation** form natural dialectical pair that could inform artistic tension algorithms
- **Chaos** theme appears both as content and structural element in writing style itself
- **Systems** theme could expand into economic, social, and technical sub-categories
- Consider cross-theme algorithms where multiple themes influence single visual elements
- Stream-of-consciousness writing style suggests temporal/sequential visual generation approaches
