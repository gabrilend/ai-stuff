## Analysis Notes for Pass 3
The following themes need further subdivision for Tier 3:

1. **Resistance** → Direct Action, Electoral Politics, Cultural Resistance
2. **Technology** → Programming Philosophy, AI Ethics, Digital Infrastructure  
3. **Identity** → Neurodivergent Masking, Trans Experience, Authentic Self
4. **Connection** → Online Communities, Real-World Organizing, Intimate Relationships
5. **Systems** → Economic Critique, Social Organization, Technical Architecture

The corpus demonstrates strong theme intersectionality - most passages contain 2-3 simultaneous themes, suggesting algorithms should blend multiple theme influences rather than discrete categorization.
