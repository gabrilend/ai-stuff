**Keywords:** trapped, prisoner, wall-staring, disconnected, alone, failing, helplessness, withdrawn, stuck, empty, abandoned, void  
**Visual Style:** Muted grays and blues, isolated geometric shapes, empty spaces, fragmented patterns, sparse compositions, single points of light in darkness  
**Prevalence:** High (~30%)  
**Art Notes:** Cellular automata with dying cells, sparse particle systems, voronoi diagrams with large empty regions, isolated object placement algorithms

**Theme Name:** fragmentation  
**Description:** Mental states shifting between different perspectives and identities, stream-of-consciousness writing that jumps between topics, broken narrative flow.  
**Keywords:** switching, moods, shades, parts, scattered, overflow, stack, different, multiple, fragments, pieces, broken  
**Visual Style:** Fractured compositions, overlapping transparent layers, glitch aesthetics, jagged edges, interrupted patterns  
**Prevalence:** High (~25%)  
**Art Notes:** Perlin noise with sharp cutoffs, recursive subdivision with random breaks, layered transparency effects, mesh distortion algorithms

**Theme Name:** gaming  
**Description:** Extensive references to video games as escapism, strategy, performance, and social interaction. Games as windows into other worlds and ways of being.  
**Keywords:** strategy, performance, MMO, video-games, play, tactical, mechanics, balance, competition, escapism, virtual, digital  
**Visual Style:** Pixel art aesthetics, geometric grid patterns, neon colors on dark backgrounds, HUD-like overlays, retro gaming palettes
