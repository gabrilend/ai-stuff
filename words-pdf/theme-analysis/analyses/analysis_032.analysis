**Keywords:** revolution, fascism, organize, liberty, tactics, caravan, mutual aid, antifa, democracy, uprising, strategy, solidarity
**Visual Style:** Red and black angular patterns, flowing banners, interconnected networks, sharp geometric forms breaking apart, cascading chains being shattered
**Prevalence:** ~35% of slice content
**Art Notes:** Use L-systems for network growth patterns, particle systems for breaking chains, cellular automata for spreading resistance movements

**Theme Name:** vulnerability  
**Description:** Deep personal struggles with depression, financial hardship, and identity conflicts. Expresses rawness about mental health, poverty, and feeling useless or disconnected.
**Keywords:** depression, broke, useless, spiral, lonely, scared, pain, anxiety, exhausted, worry, poverty, struggle
**Visual Style:** Muted grays and blues, fragmented forms, torn textures, scattered particles, erosion patterns, dim lighting with occasional warm spots
**Prevalence:** ~20% of slice content  
**Art Notes:** Perlin noise for erosion effects, probability fields for scattered elements, inverse lighting gradients, procedural tearing algorithms

**Theme Name:** connection
**Description:** Yearning for community and meaningful relationships despite isolation. References to cats, friends, shared experiences, and finding one's place in social networks.
**Keywords:** cat, friends, community, trust, love, together, connection, lonely, network, relationship, mutual, care
**Visual Style:** Warm oranges and soft purples, organic flowing lines, circular patterns radiating outward, gentle curves connecting distant points
**Prevalence:** ~15% of slice content
**Art Notes:** Bezier curves for flowing connections, voronoi diagrams for community cells, particle attraction systems, organic growth algorithms

**Theme Name:** systems
**Description:** Fascination with technological solutions, alternative economics, and infrastructure. References to programming, distributed computing, and organizational frameworks.
**Keywords:** system, technology, computing, infrastructure, network, programming, economic, organization, distributed, framework, machine, code
**Visual Style:** Cool blues and metallic silvers, grid patterns, circuit-like connections, geometric precision, modular structures
**Prevalence:** ~15% of slice content

**Theme Name:** memory
**Description:** Nostalgic reflections on past relationships, childhood experiences, and personal history. Bittersweet recollections with regret and longing.
**Keywords:** remember, past, childhood, memory, nostalgia, Boulder, Wyoming, college, friendship, regret, history, reflection
**Visual Style:** Sepia tones and faded pastels, ghostly overlays, semi-transparent forms, vintage film grain effects, soft focus elements
**Prevalence:** ~10% of slice content
**Art Notes:** Alpha blending for transparency effects, vintage filter algorithms, time-based fade functions, layered composition techniques

**Theme Name:** philosophy
**Description:** Abstract contemplations on consciousness, identity, and the nature of existence. Metaphysical musings about machines, humanity, and spiritual concepts.
**Keywords:** consciousness, machine, human, identity, existence, philosophy, spiritual, metaphysical, reality, awareness, being, purpose
**Visual Style:** Deep purples and ethereal whites, flowing abstract forms, mandala-like patterns, infinite regression effects, cosmic imagery
