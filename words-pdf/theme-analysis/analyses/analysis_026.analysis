**Keywords:** programming, linux, scripts, servers, hardware, debugging, automation, compilation, terminals, configuration, optimization, syntax
**Visual Style:** Monospace typography patterns, circuit board aesthetics, green/amber terminal colors, geometric grids, pixelated textures, binary flows
**Prevalence:** ~35% of slice
**Art Notes:** ASCII art generation, cellular automata patterns, code-like geometric structures, glitch aesthetics, terminal-inspired color schemes

## **Theme Name:** nostalgia
**Description:** Wistful reflections on retro gaming, childhood experiences, and the passage of time. Deep longing for simpler experiences and authentic connections with media and people.
**Keywords:** gameboy, retro, childhood, memories, classics, old-games, friendship, fantasy, textures, triangles, meshes, aging
**Visual Style:** Pixelated forms, warm sepia tones, CRT scanlines, 8-bit color palettes, fuzzy/soft edges suggesting memory
**Prevalence:** ~15% of slice  
**Art Notes:** Pixel art algorithms, procedural sprite generation, retro dithering patterns, memory distortion effects

## **Theme Name:** domesticity
**Description:** Intimate details of daily life including food preparation, apartment organization, cleaning routines, and creature comforts. The sacred mundane of personal space.
**Keywords:** nachos, cooking, cleaning, organizing, piles, apartment, comfort, recipes, ramen, space, furniture, cozy
**Visual Style:** Warm earth tones, organic shapes, layered textures, kitchen tile patterns, fabric weaves
**Prevalence:** ~20% of slice
**Art Notes:** Texture mapping algorithms, organic shape generation, domestic pattern libraries, warmth gradients

## **Theme Name:** paranoia
**Description:** Anxious observations about surveillance, political tensions, security concerns, and feeling watched. The weight of invisible systems and power structures.
**Keywords:** watching, surveillance, activity, paranoia, feds, infiltration, SSH-ports, encryption, privacy, precaution, subtle
**Visual Style:** Sharp contrasts, surveillance camera angles, glitch patterns, fragmented compositions, stark black/white/red
**Prevalence:** ~12% of slice

## **Theme Name:** transformation
**Description:** Personal evolution, gender transition, physical changes, and the complex relationship between identity and embodiment. Bodies as sites of change and agency.
**Keywords:** hormones, transition, werewolf, transformation, shape-shifting, mirrors, exhaustion, identity, form, body, change
**Visual Style:** Fluid morphing shapes, gradient transformations, mirror/reflection effects, metamorphic patterns
**Prevalence:** ~8% of slice
**Art Notes:** Morphing algorithms, gradient field generation, reflection/refraction effects, fluid dynamics simulation

## **Theme Name:** isolation
**Description:** The experience of being alone, misunderstood, or different. Autism, social difficulties, and the challenge of parallel play and neurotypical social expectations.
**Keywords:** autistic, alone, parallel-play, sincere, different, out-of-place, large, non-neurotypical, space-to-breathe
**Visual Style:** Negative space emphasis, single focal points, muted colors, geometric isolation, sparse compositions
