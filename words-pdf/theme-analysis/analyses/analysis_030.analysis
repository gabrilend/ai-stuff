**Keywords:** fascism, socialism, cooperation, organizing, community, defense, collective, revolution, activism, democracy, voting, solidarity
**Visual Style:** Bold angular shapes in red and black, raised fist silhouettes, geometric patterns suggesting unity and strength
**Prevalence:** ~20% of slice content
**Art Notes:** Voronoi diagrams for community boundaries, wave interference patterns for collective action, tessellating shapes for solidarity

### **3. witchcraft**
**Description:** Personal identity centered around witchcraft, magic, and mystical practices. Includes practical applications and spiritual metaphors.
**Keywords:** witch, magic, spells, enchantments, blessing, hat, protection, ritual, mystical, supernatural, manifestation, intuition
**Visual Style:** Organic spirals, crystalline structures, aurora colors (purple, green, gold), flowing lines suggesting energy patterns
**Prevalence:** ~12% of slice content
**Art Notes:** Perlin noise for magical energy fields, golden ratio spirals, particle trails representing spell casting, luminescent effects

### **4. anticapitalism**
**Description:** Sharp critique of economic systems and advocacy for alternative economic models. Focuses on wealth inequality and worker exploitation.
**Keywords:** capitalism, profit, workers, resources, exploitation, labor, wealth, corporations, economics, inequality, collective-ownership, value
**Visual Style:** Industrial imagery with rust colors (red-orange, brown), broken chains, geometric grids being disrupted or reformed
**Prevalence:** ~15% of slice content
**Art Notes:** Grid deformation algorithms, breaking/reforming patterns, decay/growth transitions, stark contrasts between rigid and organic forms

### **5. isolation**
**Description:** Loneliness, social disconnection, and the struggle to maintain relationships. Often interweaves with digital themes.
**Keywords:** lonely, friends, missing, connection, talking, communication, sadness, separation, distance, contact, relationships, community
**Visual Style:** Sparse compositions with single points of light, gradual color transitions from cold to warm, empty spaces with small focal elements
**Prevalence:** ~10% of slice content
**Art Notes:** Voronoi cell isolation, distance field visualization, scattered particle systems with occasional clustering

### **6. metamorphosis**
**Description:** Transformation, change, and personal evolution. Includes references to chrysalis, growth, and becoming.
**Keywords:** transformation, change, growth, chrysalis, evolution, becoming, journey, progress, development, breakthrough, zenith, beauty
**Visual Style:** Flowing organic forms, gradient transitions, cocoon-like shapes expanding into wing patterns, iridescent colors
**Prevalence:** ~8% of slice content
**Art Notes:** Morphing algorithms, gradient flows, butterfly effect visualizations, organic growth patterns using L-systems

### **7. technosophia**
**Description:** Philosophy of technology, programming concepts, and the intersection of human consciousness with digital systems.
**Keywords:** programming, computers, code, systems, technology, AI, algorithms, digital, software, hardware, network, data, encryption
**Visual Style:** Circuit-board aesthetics with flowing data streams, matrix-like patterns in green/amber, geometric precision mixed with organic curves
**Prevalence:** ~10% of slice content
**Art Notes:** Conway's Game of Life variants, circuit generation algorithms, binary tree visualizations, data flow representations

This slice demonstrates high thematic density with complex interweaving of digital critique, political resistance, and personal identity exploration. The visual potential is strong across geometric and organic forms, making it excellent for mixed algorithmic approaches combining structured patterns with natural growth systems.
