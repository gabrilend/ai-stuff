**Visual Style:** Sharp angular forms, breaking chains, red/black/white palette, geometric fragmentation, explosive bursts, torn/shattered patterns

**Prevalence:** ~25% - Appears throughout political commentary and philosophical discussions

**Art Notes:** Use Voronoi diagrams for fracturing/breaking effects, particle systems for explosive liberation, constraint-based algorithms that "break free" from boundaries

---

## **Theme 2: fragmentation**
**Description:** Mental, social, and digital fragmentation - scattered thoughts, broken connections, identity dissolution. References to "dissolving into puddles," intrusive thoughts, and disconnected online interactions.

**Keywords:** fractal, oblivion, sphere, dissolve, acid, scatter, intrusive, fragments, pieces, breakdown, dissociation, void

**Visual Style:** Fractal patterns, particle dispersion, acid-like dissolution effects, broken glass aesthetics, scattered points becoming unified forms

**Prevalence:** ~20% - Evident in mental health discussions and digital identity exploration

**Art Notes:** Implement recursive fragmentation algorithms, use perlin noise for organic dissolution, create systems where scattered elements occasionally coalesce

---

## **Theme 3: connection**
