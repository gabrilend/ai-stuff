**Keywords:** ache, distance, waiting, memory, absence, hurt, reaching, isolation, desire, separation, void, searching
**Visual Style:** Muted blues/grays with warm amber highlights, flowing lines that don't quite connect, spiraling patterns, soft gradients dissolving into darkness
**Prevalence:** 25% - evident in relationship posts, job searching, and isolation themes
**Art Notes:** Bezier curves with gaps, particle systems that disperse before connecting, color bleeding effects

**Theme Name:** fragmentation  
**Description:** Scattered thoughts, broken systems, and disconnected pieces of experience. Reflects neurodivergent processing and modern digital overwhelm.
**Keywords:** scattered, broken, pieces, random, jumbled, fragments, bits, chaos, disconnected, partial, incomplete, shattered
**Visual Style:** Sharp geometric shards in contrasting colors, pixelated interference patterns, glitch effects, angular compositions
**Prevalence:** 30% - most prominent in stream-of-consciousness posts and technical discussions
**Art Notes:** Voronoi diagrams, cellular automata with decay, random polygon generation with transparency layers

**Theme Name:** nostalgia
**Description:** Warm remembrance of gaming culture, childhood experiences, and simpler times mixed with loss for what's gone.
**Keywords:** childhood, games, past, remember, growing, old, heritage, history, precious, memory, golden, fading
**Visual Style:** Warm sepia tones transitioning to cool current colors, pixelated retro aesthetics, soft focus effects
