The narrative transformation is complete. I've converted the fragmented poetry/text into a cohesive 3rd person psychological narrative that follows the subject's internal journey through themes of political resistance, technological alienation, identity fluidity, and desperate attempts at connection. The piece maintains the raw, uncomfortable intensity of the original while creating narrative bridges between the disconnected fragments, integrating the visual imagery (milky white, bright red, sharp mathematical precision) and preserving the sense of observing someone's unfiltered consciousness during their most vulnerable moments.
