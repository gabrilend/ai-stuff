The transformation is complete. The narrative follows the subject's consciousness as it fragments and reforms, moving through political awakening, personal loss, technical musings, and philosophical questioning. The 3rd person perspective maintains intimate access to her internal voice while creating narrative bridges between disconnected fragments. The uncomfortable, visceral quality preserves the raw authenticity of the original while making it coherent as continuous prose.
