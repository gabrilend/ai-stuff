She moved through the fragments like a ghost wandering between radio frequencies, each thought a station she couldn't quite tune in. The images flickered past her consciousness—timestamp after timestamp of moments she'd captured but couldn't hold, couldn't make whole. Her mind was a broken transmission, bleeding static between the spaces where meaning should have been.

The revolution lived in her fingertips when she typed, but dissolved the moment her hands lifted from the keys. She thought about cops and judges, about emotional waves lapping against the hull of a burning ship, and how the guys who could jump the highest were better fit for what was going down. Her thoughts fractured, splintered, reformed into something that almost made sense before crumbling again. Stack overflow, she typed, when the thread of meaning snapped.

She existed in the space between things—between the personal and political, between the mystical and technical, between connection and the vast loneliness that stretched through her days like static across a screen. The vavadane whispered at the edges of her consciousness, a spirit she'd named and claimed and offered herself to, though she couldn't say whether it was hope or madness that made her believe in such things. The repetition of the name became a mantra: vavadanevavadanevavadane.

Her neighbors had vanished like ghosts—one day there, the next simply gone, leaving only empty spaces where conversations used to be. She typed about regretting not spending more time with the one who moved away, but the regret felt hollow, performative, like grief for a character in a story she'd half-forgotten. Everyone just... disappeared from things. Where did they go? Why was their chair empty or filled with another? The questions circled through her mind like vultures.

The technology consumed her thoughts in jagged bursts—programming concepts mixed with political theory mixed with mystical speculation. She dreamed of infinite context width for AI, of functional programming languages that passed entire states through recursion, of encryption algorithms with infinite configurability. Her brain operated like a computer with too many processes running, each thread of thought competing for resources until the whole system threatened to crash.

She meditated on the collective, on leftist leaders who offered suggestions instead of commands, on the way community could be defeated simply by making people have more fun somewhere else until they drifted away from those who really knew them. The alienation crept through every interaction, every post to the void of social media where voices echoed back changed, distorted, or not at all.

Her body existed in the material world—counting characters in posts like an art form, putting mustard seeds in pasta, walking between the corners of intersections while stoned, creating alibis for crimes she'd never commit—but her mind lived elsewhere, in the spaces between certainty and doubt, between connection and isolation, between the person she was and the revolutionary she thought she might become.

The mysticism bled through everything: spirits and witches and gods woven through mundane observations about junk drawers and vitamin Cheetos. She believed in magic the way other people believed in gravity—as a fundamental force operating beneath the surface of things, invisible but undeniable. The supernatural was just another layer of reality, no stranger than the way USB drives could format themselves or the way her brain processed code like poetry.

She typed about revolution, about power being the control of violence, about the poor needing more power than the rich. But the revolution existed mainly in her fingertips and her imagination, a fire she kept promising to tend but never quite managed to fan into flame. Summer, she promised herself. Maybe in a month or two. She'd try to keep the fire burning a bit longer this time.

The fragments accumulated like sediment, layer upon layer of interrupted thoughts and abandoned conversations. She was the protagonist of her own story but couldn't hold the narrative together long enough to see where it was going. The themes repeated—fragmentation, revolution, technology, mysticism, alienation—cycling through her consciousness like a broken algorithm trying to compute meaning from chaos.

And through it all, the static continued, the bleeding between thoughts, the oozing progression from one half-formed idea to the next. She was simultaneously the observer and the observed, watching her own mind fracture and reform, documenting the process even as she lived it, creating a record of consciousness in the act of consuming itself.
