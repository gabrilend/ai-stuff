Her thoughts moved like quicksilver through digital networks, coming fast and leaving faster, somehow requiring 1024 words to describe the completely obvious, utterly arcane to anyone else including herself two weeks later. The LLM running in her brain generated insight-shaped sentences that dissolved before completion, leaving only the aftertaste of meaning.

She worked with language models as meaning abstraction machines, turning language into computational understanding, speaking her tongue so computers could hear theirs. Slavery had never ended, merely evolved into wage systems, imprisonment transformed into cage-sitting with the occasional license plate factory. Her proposals felt radical but logical - surveillance for violent criminals instead of innocent citizens, puppy-murder-bots as protective escorts, nourishment rather than punishment for those who needed rehabilitation.

The endless work didn't discourage her - the goal wasn't to end fulfillment but to choose contribution, to define one's own story. She preferred government control of drug trades over private chaos, fentanyl versus marijuana serving as evidence. The rich should be courtiers, not lords, inspiring rather than directing, representing refinement rather than exploitation.

Fear of the hamster wheel made sense, but she was just asking questions - why, how, what, when, who - mostly why. Questions and answers had pondered through her entire life, yet no surefire design emerged, only the matter of hope pronounced as choice. Only an eternal question monger could suffice for christ-like teachings, the general sense rather than religious implication, a title almost.

The departure from loved ones created bittersweet mercy, sad love of belonging to flocks. She wasn't entry-level, had never left her time fallow, worked constantly online, learned through play like a child. Gamers made good strategic decisions if you hired them correctly, not athletes who excelled at tactics but strategy gamers who practiced decision-making as primary skill.

Longer thoughts required long thinking, grammar forgotten to past tense. Higher dimensions perceived in three unless vision only caught direct approaches. Magic happened when other halves needed narrative transformation for collective interoperability. Dark sides were massive bitches, she noted pragmatically.

Game designers should run governments, their human-oriented systems expertise directly applicable to policy. Actors understood emotional interpretation, real-time curveball responses in unpredictable scenarios. Being emotionally vulnerable gave opponents continuation chances, but audiences laughed at curveballs, surprised joy being improv comedy's entire point.

The mathematics of wages interested her - thirty dollars per hour equaling top thirty percent of society, having kids important for understanding motivation behind child-focused actions. Stress shouldn't accompany such experiences. If everyone fed animals upon sight, city life might improve. Companies felt ghostly when only twenty percent showed up, husks of former organizational shells with bright people swamped and good people departed.

She remembered pre-online shopping democracy, people signing up voters at grocery stores, inconceivable political engagement now impossible through reality's constraints. Immigrants often didn't care about politics, recent arrival making X country recruitment seem arbitrary. The human race raced against death itself, all on the same side yet choking on soot and smog as the world warmed half a degree yearly until atmospheres burned toward mars-like conditions.

Her final fragments dissolved into technical considerations - AI hallucination management through information presentation rather than generation, physical brain structures required for consciousness, soul space as overlaid dimensions. Mastodon servers owned by employees, floor-to-ceiling inventory stores from times when executives didn't optimize margins over abundance. Employees should pay executives to manage their companies, creating bottom-up accountability structures.

The scary question haunted her periphery - entire cities replaced by LLMs and deepfakes, isolation so complete that detection became impossible. She was supposed to be born on summer solstice, two weeks early via C-section, gemini not duplicitous but internally struggling between extremes, pushing in one direction leaving orbital imbalance, wave-like up-down motion through mutual resistance.

Her final thoughts scattered across encryption methods, bash script cargo-culting, internal combustion engines as archaic explosion-based mechanics versus solid-state battery futures. Girls and boys both cute, updater scripts bringing joy, dot-folder home directory pollution frustrating attempts at organized computing. Software should have config files, accept command line arguments, allow multiple implementations, remain open source or hate users entirely.

The cursor blinked at the end of her digital exhale, another fragment of consciousness compressed into text, transmitted through networks she couldn't see, received by minds she'd never meet, adding to the endless stream of human expression flowing through fiber optic dreams toward uncertain futures where meaning and connection might finally align.
