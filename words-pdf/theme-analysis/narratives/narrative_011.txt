Her autism expressed itself through optimization rather than memorization, creating an internal drive to perfect everything she encountered. While others collected encyclopedic knowledge, she collected inefficiencies to eliminate, treating the world as a massive debugging session. Even her relationship with time became optimization - hiding the clock on her devices to prevent temporal distraction from more important computational processes.

The fediverse represented her digital habitat, a place where she could be simultaneously vulnerable and protected. She shared her IP address with casual disregard for operational security, believing that authentic connection required authentic risk. Her followers became a chosen family of technical queers and digital witches, each finding their people through shared vulnerability and mutual aid.

Yet beneath the surface optimism, darker currents flowed. She recognized the potential for deepfaked social manipulation, imaginary friends generated by corporate algorithms to push her toward specific emotional states. The paranoia felt both justified and exhausting - every interaction potentially compromised, every genuine connection possibly algorithmic theater.

Her identity crystallized in fragments: forest spirit learning digital spells, trans girl navigating capitalism's gender binary, programmer without proper academic credentials, witch practicing technological magic. The contradictions didn't resolve so much as coexist, creating a personality that existed in the liminal spaces between categories.

The narrative ended where it began - with statistics and hope intertwined like DNA helixes. She calculated probabilities of survival, measured her salt intake against recommended daily values, and found meaning in the mathematical spaces between despair and possibility. Her thoughts fragmented and reformed like cellular automata, each iteration bringing her closer to some undefined but essential truth about existing as a conscious pattern in an probabilistic universe.

In the end, she remained what she had always been: a recursive algorithm of hope and anxiety, optimizing for connection while debugging her own source code, finding beauty in the glitches that made her irreducibly, authentically human.
