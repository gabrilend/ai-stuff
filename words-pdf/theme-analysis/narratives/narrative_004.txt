**The Mathematics of Dissolution**

She stared at the equation again, her mind circling like a trapped animal around the concept of division by zero. The problem gnawed at her—why wouldn't 1/0 be zero? Division was just inverse multiplication, and multiplying anything by zero yielded zero. The logic carved itself into her thoughts like a blade through butter, each consideration sharp and precise, yet somehow missing the mark. She understood the mathematical orthodoxy, knew about limits approaching different infinities from left and right, but her heart clung to the elegant wrongness of zero as the answer. It felt like standing at the exact center of infinity's contradictions.

Her credentials haunted her—better at leading than the technical work that might actually get her hired. The irony tasted bitter, like vinegar slowly eroding her teeth. She was caught between worlds: too theoretical for practical work, too practical for pure theory. The thought spiraled through her consciousness, joining the endless parade of inadequacies that marched through her awareness each day.

In the darkness of her apartment, she imagined giving friends glowstick bracelets, color-coordinated beacons in suburban twilight. The image crystallized something about vulnerability—how children understood boundaries better than adults because their existence depended entirely on others' goodwill. She felt this fragility in her bones, the knowledge that her safety was perpetually conditional, always one misunderstood word away from dissolution.

Her mind wandered to religion as a configuration file, sensible defaults passed from parent to child like inherited code. Different people needed different settings for different use cases, she reasoned, but the metaphor collapsed under its own weight when she considered her own spiritual emptiness. What defaults had she inherited? What corrupted values were running in her background processes?

The mathematical obsessions returned like waves. Complex infinity—what would that look like? If the second dimension was i, what came next? Her thoughts spiraled through dimensional space, seeking patterns in the chaos of her existence. The questions multiplied like fractals, each answer spawning new incomprehensions.

She thought about games, about shared experiences creating cohesion among friends and family. But her own gameplay was solitary, fragmented across different platforms and genres. She played alone while others built communities, watched others learn lessons together while she solved puzzles in isolation. The toughest opponents were the ones that weren't aggressive, she realized—the ones who let you grow uncontested, like trees that reached higher when branches were cleanly cut.

Her writing consumed character limits with surgical precision, leaving no room for content warnings. She lived fifteen different lives simultaneously, thoughts crisscrossing and wandering like an untrained neural network. The apologies came automatically now—sorry for what you thought, sorry for how it made you feel—but the words felt hollow, performed rather than felt.

Climate change and nanobots occupied the same mental space as her gender transition and mathematical paradoxes. She envisioned programmable matter guided by ethical constraints, but the ethics themselves seemed as undefined as division by zero. Her thoughts drifted through scenarios of collective purpose and individual agency, seeking coherence in a world that felt increasingly synthetic.

The paranoia crept in like morning fog. License plates in her apartment complex, never seeing the same people twice at the grocery store despite religious attendance to routine. Was she being hypnotized? The questions carved themselves deeper, statistical fuzziness bleeding between moments of clarity. She felt observed, documented, analyzed by intelligences she couldn't quite grasp.

Her cat required constant vigilance against the sound of impending vomit—the one thing she never procrastinated. Even her pet's distress demanded immediate response, unlike the mounting tasks that accumulated in her consciousness like sediment. She needed a maid more than a therapist, she thought, but the world insisted on fixing her mind rather than addressing her immediate needs.

The job fantasies played through her awareness: maximum net worth requirements, fuzzy animal assignments, compensation that actually covered living expenses plus dignity. Mythical positions that closed before they were posted, opportunities that existed only in the space between what was and what could be.

She wondered about hiring everyone regardless of qualifications, about the tools they might create and lives they might change. But that was communism, wasn't it? The thought tasted like forbidden fruit, sweet and dangerous in equal measure.

Gaming during work hours felt like qualification enough for software development. The logic was sound, even if the world disagreed. She played the same amount as working developers, solved similar problems, just without the formal structures and social validation.

Disney movies had taught her that kindness could change villains' minds, but reality proved more resistant to narrative convenience. Her cat knew when she was being difficult but continued anyway, understanding it was how love was expressed in their strange household. Ethical decisions emerged from proximity to others, she realized—values crystallizing through relationship rather than isolation.

The fragments of her digital existence scattered across platforms like breadcrumbs in a dark forest. She apologized for potentially harmful content while simultaneously revealing the architecture of her psychological vulnerabilities. Each post was simultaneously confession and performance, authentic expression filtered through the mathematical precision of character limits.

Her thoughts circled back to division by zero, to the space between infinities where she felt most at home. Complex numbers had positive and negative sides—why not infinity? Why not zero? Why not the precise center of everything she couldn't understand?

The narrative of her existence felt increasingly like observing someone else's life through thick glass. She could see the patterns, trace the mathematical relationships between input and output, but the meaning remained elusive, hovering just beyond the reach of her comprehension like an equation that refused to resolve.
