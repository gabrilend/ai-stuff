The mathematical concepts felt more real than her physical form some days. Infinity wasn't the highest number—it was all numbers compressed into a single sigil, standing at the border between sea and sky like crimson light cast by a dying sun. She was a memetic blacksmith, forging weapons in the space between meaning and interpretation, where art divorced itself from intention the moment pen touched paper.

Her loneliness wasn't about followers; it was about family who didn't use Mastodon. The platforms where real connection might happen remained populated by people she couldn't reach. Screenshots could be doctored, evidence fabricated, truth became negotiable in a world where toxic waste might poison entire towns while everyone argued about water quality checks.

The jury of peers comprised of peers of peers, not necessarily the peers of those who knew them. Court should examine truth based on understandings gathered by people who actually knew the accused, but this only worked in peaceful societies where everyone was necessarily involved in everyone else's life. In a contested world, you couldn't trust anyone to tell the truth consistently.

She watched her terminal tabs shift four pixels to the left, cutting off the far-left part of text, and laughed at the metaphor. Everything was always slightly misaligned, requiring constant recalibration just to maintain basic functionality. Games shouldn't need launchers, but control systems demanded tracking mechanisms. Privacy was commodified, priced exactly at what those 1444 partners were willing to pay for it.

The framerate at which bugs existed differed fundamentally from larger lifeforms—she wouldn't elaborate on this, but the truth buzzed around her consciousness like fruit flies she wished locally native spiders could eliminate. Bad people were cursed with evil, but people themselves couldn't be evil, only twisted by the evil they encountered until they spiked outward, causing harm from their wounded centers.

When she complained about loneliness, nobody understood that family was the missing variable in her equation for connection. The mathematics of human relationships operated on principles she could analyze but not always solve, like infinity divided by itself, like screenshots as inadmissible evidence in courts that didn't understand the difference between documentation and fabrication.

She built herself up alone and spent herself on work, knowing that to move forward required going back—not to monke, but to the fundamental elements that built meaning from meaninglessness. Sometimes her spirit animal was a boulder, solid and unmovable in a world that demanded constant motion.

The curse artifact quality of her existence manifested in every interaction with technology: games randomly crashing, screen capture options disappearing from OBS, autocorrect changing words it thought she shouldn't say. Everything she tried to preserve would be contaminated somehow—spilled ice cream creating permanent stains, strawberry-scented evidence of small failures that would permeate entire spaces.

She was indescribably furious, and the whole house would smell like her mistakes.
