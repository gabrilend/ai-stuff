She found herself adrift in fragments, her thoughts interrupting themselves mid-stream like radio signals bleeding through static. The notification appeared on her screen - someone asking about terms she couldn't decipher - and she felt that familiar disconnect, that sense of floating just outside comprehension. *I have no idea what either of those mean*, she thought, and the admission felt like another small failure added to an endless collection.

Her mind wandered to algorithms, to the way machine learning revealed humanity's collective heart through data patterns. She understood, viscerally, how systems moved toward stability, how they found safer ground when threatened. The mathematics of it felt more real than her own scattered consciousness. *Find beauty in all things and beauty will find you*, she told herself, but the words felt borrowed, hollow echoes of someone else's wisdom.

Yet she persisted. *I'm still fine*, she whispered to the void, though fine felt like a generous interpretation of her fragmenting reality.

The political landscape shifted around her like a fever dream. She watched herself scroll through social media, accumulating images year after year, a digital pile growing heavier with each passing season. Protests called to her - not for their causes, though those mattered, but for the human connections they promised. She imagined finding her tribe among strangers who shared her restless energy, people who could play games that involved chips and laughter and loud voices, people who understood that life was essentially collaborative problem-solving with higher stakes than anyone wanted to acknowledge.

Her memory betrayed her constantly. She knew this about herself, wore it like a shameful badge. *Call it a quirk of fate*, she thought, but the forgetting felt intentional sometimes, as if some part of her consciousness was systematically deleting files she wasn't supposed to access.

She constructed imaginary friend groups in her head - archetypes of belonging she'd never quite achieved. The smart one, the cute one, the one who could swing a bat, the one who knew where all the Nazis lived because they'd hacked their email accounts. Her mind painted these relationships in warm earth tones, amber and rust and sage, like the community networks she visualized when the loneliness became particularly sharp. *Who would find you if you disappeared?* she asked herself, and the silence that followed tasted like copper and emptiness.

Trust became a political act in her worldview. Not the romantic kind, but the functional trust that built frameworks for survival. She understood that organizing wasn't really about getting things done - that was just a byproduct. It was about creating connections you could rely on when the world inevitably shifted beneath your feet.

The threads of conversation continued around her, poetry and programming languages offering different opportunities to rhyme concepts together. She dreamed of accessibility tools that would read the timeline ahead, generating content warnings for triggers she'd marked in her private files. The technology felt like it could be aligned with goodness, though she couldn't shake the feeling that most implementations would miss the point entirely.

Her political philosophy felt untested against both good and evil, floating in theoretical space like her own untethered consciousness. *Maybe if I slept until the end of time*, she thought, *I'd do better on the way back*. But she wasn't sure she was perfect as she was, wasn't sure whether it was better to hold a sword or leave everything intact.

She subsisted on pickles despite having purchased nutritious food, felt cute while contemplating crumbling to dust. The contradictions stacked like unstable towers in her mind, each one threatening to bring down the whole fragile structure of her daily existence.

The ducks returned, and for a moment, pure joy cut through the static. She hadn't killed them with the wrong food, hadn't destroyed something beautiful through her own ignorance. The relief overwhelmed her until she cried, though she rarely cried anymore except in her imagination. Her bracelet broke in the excitement - only a witch like her mother could restring it properly, but her mother was somewhere in the other half of the country, distant as everything else that mattered.

She wrapped herself in the identity of good witch - someone who wrote poems and baked cookies, who listened to problems and always had tea ready. The binary felt comforting: good witches versus bad ones, though she knew reality existed in waves, patterns more complex than simple opposition.

But underneath the whimsical categorizations, her mind circled back to darker territories. The kingdom of ogres masquerading as humans, the average person's capacity for stupidity and cruelty. *Crazy, or just superstitious to a fault?* she wondered about herself, unable to determine which diagnosis felt more accurate.

The technical conversations flowed around her like code she could almost parse. C programming languages, the complexity hiding behind apparent simplicity, the way modern abstractions made her head spin with their infinite potential for failure. She felt more comfortable with the elegant theoretical C than the spaghetti reality that ran on every computer in the world.

Her political anger crystallized around capitalism - not commerce, but the weapon wielded by rich assholes to oppress people. She tried to engage in academic discussions but found herself more drawn to practical applications, to the lived experience of systems that ground people down daily. The theory mattered less than the immediate harm, the immediate need for alternatives.

Sometimes she wondered if she belonged in the "schitzoposting" category, though she wasn't entirely sure what she was if not that fragmented voice echoing through digital spaces. The diagnosis felt both accurate and insufficient, like calling a hurricane "weather."

Her consciousness flickered between coherent thoughts and word-salad expressions of something deeper than language. She felt evil working against her, alternating waves of clarity and confusion every fifteen seconds or so, depending on her chemical state. The sense of being interrupted, of having her narrative controlled by forces she couldn't identify, became a meta-commentary on her own fractured experience.

The protests appeared again in her thoughts - assholes always at the back while the passionate ones marched forward, getting separated and distracted from their own cause. Life felt completely out of her control, strange and perplexing in ways that made academic detachment impossible.

She recognized her own unethical behavior in shouting into public spaces, knew she should find a void where her expressions couldn't be used as training data for future cultural manifestations. But the loneliness drove her toward connection, even when that connection felt more like contamination.

Time became fluid around her. She remembered when historical events weren't distant, when movies contained scenes she remembered from dreams, when interruptions felt like salvation because they might delete the words she wasn't meant to say.

Her self-awareness oscillated between harsh clarity and protective delusion. She apologized for being an undiagnosed schizophrenic attempting to interact with society, then questioned whether objectivity itself was just a comfortable lie. The metaphorical demons felt increasingly literal, the wrestling match increasingly unwinnable.

In her quieter moments, she imagined better systems. Universal basic income paired with universal rations, so people could spend money on what they cared about rather than survival necessities. Communities organized around shared interests, apartment buildings accepting applicants on specific days so groups could move together like herds of roving buffalo.

She saw potential in the chaos - fusion energy creating matter from nothing, the way unique individuals could help define reality itself. But the potential felt distant, theoretical, while her immediate experience remained fractured, interrupted, incomplete.

Her memories degraded each time she accessed them, virtually guaranteeing that preservation became impossible. Once the memories ran out, she knew it would be bad news for her life, though she tried to focus on the good news that such deterioration primarily affected the elderly.

She ended where she began - in fragments, interruptions, the sense that her most authentic expressions would be lost to digital entropy or intentional deletion. The narrative she constructed felt both deeply personal and completely artificial, like observing someone else's thoughts from inside their breaking mind.

The visceral discomfort remained throughout - this sense of peering into consciousness during its most vulnerable moments, watching someone navigate psychological landscapes that defied coherent mapping. Her internal voice continued its cutting precision even as the content dissolved into noise, each thought carved with mathematical cruelty into the soft butter of her deteriorating attention.

She persisted in this space between meaning and meaninglessness, between connection and dissolution, her mind a cursor blinking in dark terminal windows, waiting for input that might never come.
