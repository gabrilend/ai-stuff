The revelation came to her in fragments: that trust was a luxury she couldn't afford, that she would let people down not through betrayal but through her own gravitational pull toward irresolution. She was drawn to paths that avoided anything concrete, like a rabbit who could always find home but never learned to build one.

In her most lucid moments, she understood that being good at video games meant making the experience enjoyable for others, not just winning. She wanted to gather programmers in mountains with laptops and whiteboards, to create something beautiful together while sitting around campfires and dreaming of better tomorrows. But even her dreams felt borrowed from someone else's imagination.

The election loomed like a precipice, and she couldn't understand how people continued their normal lives when losing democracy meant thirty years of purges. She'd written 3,855 posts, approximately 657 pages of text, pouring her fragmented consciousness onto the internet like blood offerings to unknown gods. "I hope you know that I love you, dear reader, though I do not know you," she'd written, meaning every word while knowing it changed nothing.

At the end of her life, she realized, she would have built a person—not a good person or a bad person, just a person who tried to make sense of a senseless world through video games and midnight revelations, through political rants and technical fixes, through the constant ache of being too much and not enough simultaneously. She was always trying to be helpful, always trying to teach, and sometimes that got real fucking annoying, even to herself.

The narrative of her existence felt cursed, like a artifact that shouldn't be touched but couldn't be ignored—all sharp edges and mathematical precision, oozing between moments with the statistical fuzziness of a mind that measured everything and understood nothing, trapped forever in the bright white and bloody red of consciousness that cut like butter through the dark.
