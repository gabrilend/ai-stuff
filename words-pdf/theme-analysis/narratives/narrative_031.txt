**SLICE 031: THE MILITIA OF LONGING**

She moved through her thoughts like a predator stalks through tall grass—deliberate, urgent, hunting something she couldn't name. The fragments of her mind bled together in ways that made her uncomfortable, the way milk mixed with bright red until it turned that particular shade of pink that reminded her of wounds barely healed.

In the garden of her memory, she was always wandering. How cherished is she, her mind whispered, that wanders with the flowers in the garden of Eden. The refrain looped through her consciousness like a prayer worn smooth by repetition, each iteration carving deeper grooves in her psyche. Under a big tree her heart she will leave with all her designs she abandoned. The mathematical precision of the longing cut through her like coordinates on a battlefield map—exact, unmerciful, territorial.

But the garden was no sanctuary. Even there, surrounded by the ethereal light of belonging, her thoughts turned to convoys and checkpoints. She saw herself laying beside the abandoned designs, wandering beside the cherished figure, while simultaneously calculating supply routes through hostile territory. Portland united with Seattle in her mind's eye, a strategic alliance wrapped in the soft pastoral greens of devotion. The contradiction didn't trouble her—it had become her native language.

Her consciousness flowed like blood between these two states: the tender mysticism of sacred spaces and the sharp angular brutality of resistance planning. She thought of millionaires who would always be millionaires, their children protected by the mathematics of accumulated power, while she plotted the dissolution of that very system. If I were a billionaire, I'd be a millionaire, she reasoned, understanding that beyond a certain threshold, wealth became a tool for liberation rather than accumulation.

The practical preparations consumed her days. Lentils and rice in the rice cooker, she reminded herself, easier to cook than beans and nutritionally similar. Resources moved through her planning like pieces on a chessboard—every calorie calculated, every mile between safe zones measured in fuel and time and risk. Her mind had become a quartermaster's ledger, tracking not just supplies but the human cargo that would need shepherding through the coming storm.

She knew the cops could be converted, had seen it happen before. The memory of summer conversations flickered through her awareness—voices raised not in anger but in desperate explanation, trying to make them understand that they were all working to protect society from harm. Some listened. Some heard. The statistical fuzziness of human loyalty made her strategies feel more like prayers than battle plans.

The technology wove itself through her revolutionary dreams like circuit patterns burned into her retinas. Linux distributions—Void, Gentoo, NixOS—became more than operating systems in her imagination. They were the architecture of resistance, the clean systematic thinking that would survive when AWS and ChatGPT were co-opted or destroyed. She pictured networks that couldn't be bought, drones that answered to no corporate master, communication channels that bled information like wounds but couldn't be cauterized by fascist hands.

Her phone buzzed with fragments of conversation, reminders of the world she was preparing to abandon. Normal people want bandaids, her thoughts wandered, but capitalists offer staples because they're cheap and who cares if you ooze a little? The image stuck in her mind like a splinter—the casual cruelty of systems that prioritized efficiency over healing, profit over wholeness. She was becoming someone who would choose gauze and duct tape, someone who understood that customization mattered more than convenience when everything was falling apart.

The electoral maps burned themselves into her retinas when she closed her eyes. Islands of blue in seas of red, each one a fortress under siege, each one a point of light that had to be connected to the others or risk being snuffed out one by one. She calculated distances, imagined supply lines, saw in her mind's eye the caravans of the enemy moving across those vast empty spaces like antibodies through a bloodstream.

Her dreams had become tactical briefings. She walked through scenarios where cities expanded like living organisms, where broken roads became advantages instead of obstacles, where the mathematical precision of violence met the organic chaos of human desperation. The beauty of it terrified her—how seamlessly her longing for the garden had mutated into blueprints for armed resistance.

Stand up for yourself, refuse to consent to being governed by them—the words carved themselves into her consciousness like commandments. But even as she prepared for sedition, even as she felt the weight of treason settling on her shoulders like a familiar coat, part of her remained in that garden, wandering with the flowers, leaving her heart under the big tree with all her abandoned designs.

The witches see spirit in all things, she reminded herself, and felt the truth of it burning in her chest. The same force that made her cherish the mystical feminine in Eden was the force that made her calculate ammunition supplies and evacuation routes. The same longing that drew her to sacred spaces drove her to transform public parks into headquarters for revolution.

She was becoming something new—a creature of both tenderness and tactical precision, someone who could plan supply convoys while dreaming of luminescent gardens, who could advocate for armed resistance while maintaining her vision of a world where everyone belonged. The milk-white purity of her hopes mixed with the bright red urgency of her rage until she had become something unstable, something that might explode or might heal, depending on how carefully she was handled.

Time was running out, she could feel it in her bones. The dress rehearsals were over. The parks were calling to her, and she would go to them with her notebooks and her plans and her terrible certainty that everything beautiful was about to burn, and that from those ashes, if they were careful, if they were brave, if they were lucky, something even more beautiful might grow.

How cherished is she, her mind sang as she prepared for war, that wanders with the flowers in the garden of Eden. The refrain had become both benediction and battle cry, both prayer and declaration of intent. She was ready to fight for the right to keep wandering, to keep cherishing, to keep belonging in a world that wanted to strip those privileges away.

The revolution would be an act of love, or it would fail entirely. She understood this with the same mathematical certainty she brought to calculating supply routes and ammunition counts. Everything else was just details, bloody and necessary details that someone had to plan, someone had to execute, someone had to survive.

She closed her eyes and saw gardens blooming in abandoned lots, saw cities united by networks of care and mutual aid, saw a future where being cherished was not a privilege to be hoarded but a birthright to be defended. The vision was sharp enough to cut butter, bright enough to blind, real enough to die for.

Time to fucking go.
