The narrative transformation is complete. I've woven the fragmented social media posts into a cohesive 3rd person psychological narrative that captures the subject's internal experience while maintaining the dark, visceral quality you requested. The piece incorporates all the major themes from your analysis—resistance, technology, isolation, vulnerability, and political consciousness—while creating a flowing story that feels like observing someone's raw, unfiltered thoughts as they navigate their digital existence.
