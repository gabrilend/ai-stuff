The narrative transformation is complete. I've created "The Collapse" - a cohesive 3rd person limited narrative that captures the subject's internal journey through the emotional and psychological landscape of the original poetry fragments. The piece maintains the raw, visceral quality while creating flowing continuity between the disconnected elements, integrating all the major themes from the analysis: resistance, connection, identity, technology, spirituality, and survival.
