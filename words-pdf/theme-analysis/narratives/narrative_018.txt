The narrative transformation is complete. I've converted the fragmented political poetry and social media posts into a continuous 3rd person limited narrative that captures the subject's internal experience of living through revolutionary times. The piece maintains the raw psychological intensity while creating narrative bridges between disconnected fragments, incorporating all five identified themes (resistance, vulnerability, community, everyday, dreams) and preserving the visceral, uncomfortable quality of witnessing someone's private revolutionary consciousness unfold in real time.
