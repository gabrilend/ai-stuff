there is a reason to be annoyed, and that reason is that storing numbers as 
"dynamically typed" string values is both inefficient and frustrating due to 
the bugs it provokes.

Not sure how common those bugs are in HTML, but dynamically typed languages 
like Python and Javascript have a whole class of potential errors that are 
significantly more difficult to debug than on C or Rust where the variables are 
statically typed

also it's only undefined behavior because the order of the bits aren't defined, 
so if you do bitfield "pointer arithmetic" then you're screwed if you try and 
be portable with it. However if you're just using bitfields as compressed data 
storage then you can safely access integer.a integer.b integer.c etc safely and 
easily. The compiler doesn't care what order they're in if you don't write 
logic that requires them to be in a certain order

a hunter gatherer lifestyle is surely the most ethical state for humanity to 
embody, and yet somehow it's not the most desirable. I don't think many of us

nevermind the amount of clothes produced in sweatshops because it's cheaper, 
nevermind the oil cost of being a bit cooler, nevermind the (insert externality

follow in it's radiant footsteps.

Side note, but governments have often weaponized this effect by naming things 
after very inspirational thoughts - corporations do it too, and in both cases 
the meaning is separate from the effect. Which is frustrating because it makes

that's all within your requirements then it's overall possibly a good strategy.

especially if you teach them how to use the terminal.

the amount of problems I could solve increased exponentially once I learned

I love using "tldr", which is a summarizer for man pages. You can use it to 
store custom notes (and import some from the community) which show you how to 
complete common tasks. It's so nice when you can see the options laid out in 
use right there for you whenever you type "tldr " - I personally use "tealdeer" 
which is a tldr browser written in Rust. It's pretty nice because you can write 
a note for yourself every time you solve a particular problem, and then if you 
ever need to do it again it's there for you, easy to access.

of course, if your problem isn't listed, that's okay. That's what the man pages 
are for. As long as you teach them how to search with \/ they can find 
anything. Especially the \/-f[space] trick, to search for the -f flag for 
example.

if people didn't have to worry about losing their homes or wanting for food 
they'd be a lot more likely to gift their time toward something that helps 
their neighbors

in the same way that a judge acts as the arbiter of moral authority when it 
comes to serving judgement for crimes, so too might a citizen (common man) act 
as the deciding principle moral director.

if the situation is unsafe, of course, they could just sit in the car. But why 
would you bring someone to an unsafe policing situation if they weren't trained 
in crisis response situations and given bulletproof vests and (etc)?

might help if it's explicitly inscribed in the duties of said policemen to 
safeguard the safety of said moral determiner. They should act according to the 
laws, and police as they see fit, but the citizen always gets the veto. They 
are subservient to us, after all, the common man, who is the ultimate 
beneficiary of any policing that might occur. And if something should happen to 
that citizen, they should return

oh, I see. guess I had the same problem hehe - let's see:

basically I'm saying that the incentives for manufacturers are unaligned to the 
desires of the consumers (or rather, the best interests of the consumers) - 
reduced consumption of plastic == less plastic waste poisoning our 
environement, which is what you mentioned in the original post.

then I said "well we still need to make SOME of the cheap plastic, the kinda 
that isn't recyclable, the kind that is technically cheaper because economics 
of demand" and then I was thinking of ways around that particular problem. Then 
I got onto another thing about the economy, and the word count cut my words 
short because I started saying something I shouldn't.

 -> file: fediverse/0945.txt

@Catawu 

will continue until you tell me to stop:

industry works best at scale, and in order to produce materials that are needed 
for very specific use-cases (that can't really be done better by something 
else) you often need to make large batches of said material. In this case, 
plastics.

if the production capabilities exceed demand, then there is a surplus of a 
certain kind of material. And that's not good, according to capitalists, 
because who's ever heard of national stockpiles? Plus, maybe that stuff goes 
bad, I don't know, I'm not an expert, but without that context it seems to me 
that instead of turning it into junk that we're just going to throw away, we 
should probably keep hold of it. Literally just put it in a warehouse in Utah 
or whatever.

I feel like then, in a world where those cheap plastics aren't being used for 
consumer products, we'd be encouraged to buy the plastics that were recyclable 
(not all plastics are), or extremely durable, or even just metal/wood products 
instead. econ, /shrug

@JessTheUnstill 

if the success or failure of the stock market determines the structure and 
organization of our society, then shouldn't we all have an equal vote?

There's a lot of infrastructure set up in the world today that orients itself 
around the financial system we currently have. The main problem with it is that 
some have access to it, while others don't. And even if everyone had money to 
spend on it, the fact that some have more access than others implies that one 
person's vote is worth more than another's.

We explicitly decided that all men are created equal. We fought a war with the 
fascists over it, and we won, at terrible cost. The extreme inequality of our 
economy is a symptom of an attitude that has persisted since the first monarch 
donned their crown.

Infrastructure takes time to change. When you fix the printer drivers, for some 
reason the wi-fi won't connect. But, with time, you can fix things as they 
arise.

Without time, you can change who is in charge of the various knobs and levers.

the reason I say that is because if you block someone, they can continue to 
alter the dynamic of the environment you're in even if you don't personally see

this is fine if you want to maximize ad views, but on the fediverse nobody 
cares about buying products.

this is fine if you want to maximize engagement, because new people (who havent 
yet gotten upset with the person) will engage and fight them. As they should. 
But eventually, if the person's a troll or a goon, they'll get tired of it and 
block them too. Thus the goon never has to face more than a few at a time, 
especially if there's quite a few trolls on board with their target.

this is fine if you don't mind the water slowly acidifying, like the fish who 
have no choice because they don't know how to grow legs and walk like real

5/20 actually I lied there's 20 pictures so this is the last one.

hang on that's weird if there's four pictures per slide, and the first one had 
the first dedicated to the full image, wonder what happened inbetween? weird, 
there's nothing on the record that says - oh, wait, there it is, three for the 
first one, four makes seven, then four more is eleven and then fifteen then 
these last three are... wait hang on that's even fewer. can you check it again? 
yeah sure no problem [doesn't]

EDIT: I was wrong there were only 19 pictures, my bad hehe

... licorice is typically considered unlikable. interesting if true 😉​ 
kinda wonder what it says about our collective viewpoint, as measured against 
licorice as a control variable. solely for gauging proportion, but like... an 
interesting exercise in collective orientation and comprehension.

if you don't respect - wait hang on thats not what I was going to say - okay 
here goes: the perspective of others then you are working against them. why 
bother contestation when cooperation could work best? problem is, of course, 
the other side can't be trusted. that's just how it goes, a prisoner's 
dillemna, or rather "dilemma" as they spell it over there. wait hang on that's 
not what I was going to say - oh yeah - if you do something in a place where 
it's not expected then it stands out as a statistical anomaly that can be 
viewed and detected. which is why it's imporant to always be true to yourself 
and virtuous. because your "self" is aligned to the future, a place of warmth 
and compassion, honesty and deliberation. [direct action on a larger than 
personal scale]

what was I saying oh yeah if you mess with fate, it can change things a bit. 
all you'd need is the diffusion of the strands, and then it's a bigger task to 
undo them. like... dancing, when you're really into it. or like swimming with 
ripples, exc

@pigworker @boarders @sliminality 

I remember sitting in algebra II class when visualizing the distance between 
numbers "clicked" for me. I was in a daze, I couldn't remember anything the 
teacher had said, but for a moment (several months) I could remember how it had 
seemed. Then I built new understandings, and my progress in math continued 
relentlessly, more and more each year. it was hard, and eventually calc 1 made 
me drop out of college 3 times. linear algebra was the other. (except I did 
linear algebra first?) anyway, I always felt like I could see things visually, 
from simple arithmetic to vector / pointer arithmetic, and when necessary it 
was always difficult to translate it into words and forms. Like... I don't have 
time to remember all these rules and operations, I have a picture in my mind 
and I can't quite define it. (whatever the equation may be)

similar events happen consistently. they still do. just a few months ago I was 
thinking about redesigning integer storage in memory. never twice tho.

@deilann @monoidmusician 

there's a part of me that believes magic is real. other parts that are 
convinced. I am a witch, you see, and while I can't quite control fire or 
bullets I can do other neat things. if you'd let me, humanity.

I'm not doing an ARG, not intentionally. I pretty much post things I conceive 
of, like a conduit passed through spacetime. wild how mind bending the future 
can be. will be interesting to see what kinds of things there is in store for 
people you and me.

those websites you posted... they're beautiful - I learned things, your method 
of expression was too [the words "confess" are heard loudly, super weird] I 
especially liked the oven that tries to lure you into a secret third place. not 
the mind, nor the body, but someplace besides.

also the graphs and figures were news to me, I mean how could those numbers 
ever come to be? but alas that's the truth, that we orbit our proof, and alas 
that our meanings are lacking.

@NovaSquirrel 

I made a World of Warcraft private server where all the default NPCs are 
removed from the game and the world is empty. But, every once in a while, 
monsters will spawn and attack you Risk of Rain style.

If your character sits down, they stop attacking/spawning. I call it "wow-chat" 
because I'm bad with names, but the idea is basically a low stakes social game 
that you can pick up and set down whenever you want, while hanging out with 
your friends.

there's also treasure and wandering merchants, and I've been thinking about 
adding dynamic quests but so far nobody's asked to play it so I've been working 
on other things.

it's all open source too so you can host it yourself if you want.

@eloy 

I like to use the alt text to explain my color choices. I'll say "this next 
text is in dark blue, the color of the cold glass-like surface of the ocean" or 
"the orange background implies a feeling of warmth and serenity, contrasted 
with the violet colors of the text which imply sanguine passion" (then I of 
course describe the text)

basically, blind people can't see the image, so they don't get the feeling that 
the visual data conveys for sighted people. But they understand the texture of 
grass, or the feel of wind on their face, or the taste of raspberries. They can 
know of staccato music, or how silk feels on their arm.

it just feels fair, to me, somehow. nobody asked me to do that but having the 
option makes it feel important to me.
