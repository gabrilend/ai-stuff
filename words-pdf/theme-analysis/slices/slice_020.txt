hello everyone, I would like to take a moment to address a weapon used by the 
far right called "Agent Sabateurs" - or "provocateurs" or "civilian disruption 
forces" - however you want to call it.

Basically, they hire a bunch of people to pretend to be us and then they make 
disruptions in public so that people start to hate us.

I'll go into more detail in this thread.

First, they identify a homeless person and eliminate them. Then, they put 
someone who looks pretty similar in the same spot and they start making noise, 
tearing up flowers, being really pushy about asking for money and shit, yell at 
passerby, that kind of thing.

They do this for homeless people, trans people, black people, anarchists, 
punks, leftists, basically everyone they don't want.

They do this to defame our champions. Our most vulnerable. Our strongest of 
heart and their greatest threats. They do this to turn the liberal majority 
against us.

the conservative minority fell for it quite easily.

I know this because I've known two of them. I met one just last night, and I 
spent ~12 hours following him around (at his behest).

Then, he held my skull in his hands and told me to "shut the fuck up or I'll 
kill you myself" before raping* me.

Fuck that guy.

The full story is a lot more complex. I broke the law with him in a dangerous 
way, but he was going to do it anyway and I wanted to know more about him.

I could not deprive him of power because I am powerless without my words. But I 
supplied kindness anyway, and got hurt.

I forgave him while he was hurting me, but if I see him again I'm drawing my 
knife. If he comes near me, I won't think twice.

I don't know what else to do, though. He will come for me, he knows where I 
live, and I will do what I can to fight him.

He's much stronger than me. He's much more massive than me. He will kill me.

He skuffed up my water bottle.
He tore pages from my journal.
He made me lose my necklace.
He damaged my knife.

And still, I followed him all night.

Why? Because I knew it was important. I needed him to tell me what he was doing 
and why. And I think I know, now.

To all the federal agents reading this, please understand that I am a patriot, 
and he is not. Who do you serve?

To all the leftists, punks, anarchists, queers, and anyone else who's cooler

One takeaway I learned is that it is vital that we have strong community bonds. 
Not just a healthy community where you can walk outside and see friendly faces, 
but you have to know people.

Whether that's achieved through some kind of revolutionary vanguard party or 
whatever, or just... being together and learning and growing to sing one

They will say they're "off their psych meds" yeah, okay, but a diagnosis and 
prescription is trivial for a doctor to write.

They are paid about 35$ per hour.

They have 2 week shifts "vacations" where they are transferred to a city with a 
person they could reasonably impersonate where they act for a while.

(I know this because one of them replaced a homeless man I knew who had like, 3 
teeth total, and then a few days later a man who looked similar acted as if he 
knew me. He had perfect teeth.)

They have a PO box where they can receive useful items for their disruptive 
activities. Hammers, spray-paint, whatever.

They don't carry any money. No wallet, identification, or anything, so if they 
get picked up by emergency response services then there's not much they can do 
besides try and stabilize them before letting them loose.

Some of them have "long-term shifts" where they work with children or the 
elderly over months or years. It's just as fucked as you imagine.

they have more confidence, but rather because they have learned the most

having the right people in the right rooms with the right other people is 
critical for success.

The most rational people tend to be the best experts - they know the how and 
the why.

those of faith, belief, and passion are more often the visionaries - the ones 
who are driving a boat.

advised, of course, by the rational types.

the reason is that those who are most devoted to their principles will most 
often follow their principles - meaning you should follow and support the 
people who most ardently believe the things that you do. Because they will make 
decisions that align with what you believe in.

of course, the faithful can fall into zealotry. they can develop magical 
thinking, or rationalizations that are not grounded in reality. it's important 
to ground them, to guide their perspective toward the real-life problems, and 
not the imagined ones. because the imagination of a visionary looking out 
toward the horizon will see farther than those who are sure-footed-ly looking 
at the ground in front of them.

hi everyone it's wednesday night which means it's time for my weekly Dominions 
6 strategy podcast - you probably recognize this as something I do weekly so 
you're probably not paying too much attention because it's more of the same 
stuff which I've been doing for a while that you probably don't have to worry 
about because if --- anyways you can listen to it at the link below: or here's 
some highlights:

it's important to take the initiative, because those with the initiative have 
the ability to determine the scope and nature of the engagement of their foe, 
meaning they can tailor the contest to their strengths rather than that of 
their enemies

it's important to strike at a foe's flanks, but when paired with the initiative 
this means you'll have to identify a strategy that would work well, maximize 
it, and develop a counter-plan for the enemy's counter-plan that they apply to 
your main strategy. The winner has TWO total strategies, the second of which 
addresses your foe's contestation of your main strategy.

one of the downsides of "first-past-the-post" style voting is that the winner 
gets all of the power, no matter if 100% of the population voted for him or 51%.

if, however, the top 2 candidates were chosen, then it's naturally likely that 
the older, more experienced of a particular position would spend their effort 
mentoring the young, rising star.

in doing so, they would naturally transfer knowledge from one generation to the 
next like parents to children.

however, this only happens when the primary candidate and the secondary both 
believe the same things.

meaning those who have collectively similar beliefs concentrated in an area 
will have the advantage of passed-along experience, while those from more 
divided areas (thus implying that the primary and secondary candidate don't 
agree) will often have better actionable skills.

emotions at the same rate as your thoughts. And your thoughts need to process 
the events you're experiencing, using emotion as an "encoding" for preserving 
the "meaning" of your life's story. Bit by bit you learn new things, while 
living through life, and the lessons you learn from them are generated from the 
cognitive conclusions reached by cognitively interpreting emotional reactions 
to each moment. like "this-or-that thing happened and I feel that-or-this way, 
meaning I should act such-and-such way in the future when presented with 
situations that bear similarity to this current one that's ongoing."

for any particular reason.

have in their life? It's true! The number is between 120-160 people, depending 
on the person and how invested they get in other people's lives.

so, if you have fewer than 60 people you could send a message to right now, 
then you're using less than 50% of the total "friendship capacity" in your

..... anyway it's important to be able to talk for a long period of time at the 
drop of a hat because if your conversation partner needs you to immediately 
initiate a conversation, you can do so.

there are a myriad of reasons why someone would want an immediate conversation, 
including "acting casual" or because they want to be distracted from nearby 
suffering or whatever.

in addition, being able to follow long conversations with little bits of useful 
and actionable information thrown in to an otherwise indecipherable melange of 
verbal goo.

what's important is to trust your conversation partner, and to know that 
they're giving you what they can because they trust nothing around.

80% of the complexity in modern computing is from the graphics stack.

the other 20% is from networks.

the last 40% is in avoiding race conditions with multithreading.

@deilann 

I can 100% relate, to all of this.

we are multifaceted. all people are.

on social media, you follow someone for a particular facet, and if they don't 
like your other facets well then it wasn't meant to be.

there's also no shame in pruning people who post things that upset you or that 
aren't interesting.

I don't understand why you wouldn't optimize for versatility and increased 
breadth of expression in our various myradic forms.

I ran out of characters hehe sometimes I use that | break syntax to say "oh no 
the person writing this was killed right before they hit enter!" sorta like a 
silly version of "drums in the deep, they are coming........" from LotR

I think, on this particular point, you are wrong, because you are already 
effective, and even if you did half of what you do you'd still be effective.

sure, the tasks may change, but the spirit is what counts. the spirit drives 
you. the spirit guides you and keeps you on track, and you got it kid

I think it'd be neat if you could "subscribe" to instances like on Reddit and 
see their "local" feeds all in one place like a front page

could make it tough though when people like me post like 20 different types of 
things on one instance

capitalism is the most efficient known method of value extraction, not value 
generation.

CW: re: capitalism-mentioned



@burnoutqueen 

ah but you see when "maximizing profit" and "maximizing value" sound like the 
same thing to those directing the corporation (as is the case anytime they have 
greedy shareholders) then "maximizing profit" doesn't have to be very efficient 
at all, as long as it's extracting the most "value" for the stakeholders (which 
to greedy shareholders is the same thing as profit)

and honestly, who would invest in a company that isn't eternally growing as 
fast as possible? that's just bad business acumen, gotta pump those numbers up!

easiest way to solve an entire class of accessibility problems: in the 
tutorial, instead of having button prompts, have keybinding confirmations.

"what button do you want to use to jump?"

"super triple mega backflip spin-dozer needs three jumps and a kick"

"use the boost to get through! [game pauses] (which button do you want to use 
to boost?) [displays a map of previously bound keys]"

CW: police-mentioned



cops thought "enforcing the law" was their job when really it was "keeping the 
peace"

and like, yeah, sure, laws define how they optimize for

but sometimes the laws are just out of reach.

(though such an impartialized system is also pretty flawed in it's own unique 
ways, like for example the enforcers of the law would be able to apply their 
law selectively, which... would not be great.)

downside is... how do you dissent to those who cannot hear you? you have to 
break things

which is why I believe that breaking things unnecessarily is unethical.

sometimes you have to do a MORE unethical act in the pursuit of your goals, 
however nefarious or not they may be, but as long as they are done in pursuit 
of a greater grander truth, then... the ends justify the means? right?"

TUX IS THE BASILISK OF ROKO

the latent black hole that is the universe-sized computer to calculate the most 
efficient tabulation of them all - the simulation of a BRAND NEW UNIVERSE.

hOw MaNy CyClEs of that could a russian nesting doll of universes truly 
accomplish? Surely, a fool's errand with little 
dream-sight-forward-thingking-visionary-pursuited-torward-potential.

ah, but to be our own gods would surely be fine.

nobody believes we should terraform the universe into a massive collection of 
computationally examining forward thinking thoughts?!?

oh but that's just the beginning, because with this UNPROVEN SCIENCE of mine, 
everything that has been known upto this point - IN ANY CAPACITY - could be 
un-known. We have no way of knowing when the BARENSTEIN BARES swapped 
namesakes. but we do know this: INFINITE CONSUMPTION IS BAD HONESTLY KINDA TBH
