The supreme court is the institution which protects our most sacred of 
documents. It is a court most supreme, but their word is not law - they protect 
and adapt the law to fit our new societal conclusions.

The constitution is law, and they broke it at the behest of a tyrant king we 
shouldn't need to vanquish.

They broke the law. They are criminals.

The constitution is a document which bears our most precious of human rights. 
It has been amended many times, to include additional protections and 
guidelines for the standards we owe to each other.

The one standard that stands above all is that your rights end where another's 
begin. This law is universal, it Trumps all else.

When rights are deprived, liberty dies. Liberty, the freedom to be, to do as 
you will and exist in our society. Liberty, that most sacred of trees, the 
branches that shade us and the roots that [support us, but pronounced like 
chain, shame, profane, contain, something like that]

One standard that exists alongside many others is the right to be as you are in 
public society. Public is defined as something we share, and to deny the right 
to be for any other is to deny them liberty.

In cities, the streets are public. In rural areas, the commercial spaces 
(outdoor malls) aren't, but probably should be. In the distant past of last 
week, they could harass you until you left. Now, jail.

The judges prevent the politicians from harming the people who elect the 
politicians who select the judges. Sounds like it should work well, no?

well... the people are divided, but the politicians it seem are hardly so. So, 
the politicians elect their judges, who allow the passage of such laws which 
contradict the will of the people.

The keys to power should rest in the hands of those who deserve it, not those

It's worked well enough for several hundred years, but now that it's crumbling 
I think we can see that the foundation was cracked. The founding fathers owned 
slaves! Everyone did! And yeah, we've updated our views a bit, but... did we 
really?

I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.

A shaky foundation's no good. The entire structure needs to be torn down and 
built up again, deciding with intention which pieces we should bear forth from 
the past, and which were just not made to last.

From those pieces, we might forge new documented standard understandings, 
regulations which define our societal proceedings. A contract, between a 
consenting person and the state's protected institutions.

But that's for tomorrow, or the next day, or perhaps another day still. Today 
we are busy, as revolutions are quite a big thrill.

Except what they really did was split us. For apparently after we turned from 
the commercial section, toward the bridge toward the university, the other half 
went south instead. Toward the commercial section. Or perhaps it was just 
because we had stopped.

Down there, it became the riot which was shown on TV. I can't help but wonder 
how much more peaceful we would be if we were led where our leaders intended. 
Alas.

When we split, some of us followed toward the east. But then they stopped 
coming, and the little blob faded into the background as everyone returned or 
went home.

I stayed and watched, because I wanted to know how the cop with shaky hands 
would react.

After a bit, the tear gas started flying, and then I saw the cops moving in 
from the sides, like Alexander's companion cavalry, and that's when I slid 
through the cracks.

Then, I went home. The next couple days the protests had significantly fewer

At BLM in Philadelphia, we allowed the police to surround us. We had a massive

I was near the front, and as our fellows moved ahead and started 
spray-painting, I looked at those around me who were beginning to realize it 
wasn't a protest.

A few hundred heads ahead was the front of the line, and we turned when 
directed - toward the north, away from the commercial district, toward the 
bridge that would take us to the universities. Well, Temple at least. Not the 
old historic kind.

They stopped us at the bridge, and told us we couldn't go ahead. I sidled my 
way to the front after a few minutes of standing around, and I saw a cop almost 
reach for his gun. With shaking hands he steadied himself, but frankly it was 
hardly his fault - the people in front of him were feinting a punch.

But that didn't matter, his instincts won out. Then someone lit a car on fire, 
and the organizers moved us on out.

I think every law or policy should be required to be labelled as "short term" 
or "long term"

the short term ones are meant to gather information, to try things out, and to 
reassess after stated conditions have been met. Ideally with protections 
against "infinite loops" - a term that any programmer will know.

The long term legislation is something that can be relied on for quite a while. 
If there is enough momentum, then an alternative can be created, but the 
original must remain operational. The alternative must be "short term", and if 
it's deemed successful and does not harm the long-term it's contrasting, then 
sure yeah go ahead implement both.

Vegetables are delicious! There's lots of nutrients. However vegetables, while 
can be eaten raw, are much more useful for your body molecularly if you cook 
them first. I think it breaks down the cellular walls so that your body can 
digest the juicy tasty nutrients locked within.

Vegetables also don't have calories, that you get from things with vitality. 
You are what you eat, and sometimes if you need it you might want to try meat. 
Me? I'm a vegetarian, that's why I'm so skinny! Carnivores have it so easy, I 
have to eat about 2x as much rice-and-beans by weight.

At least I'm not vegan - I can supplement with fats like butter and cooking 
oil, which are useful when combined with nutrients, as they allow your body to 
store them for later. Just make sure you eat enough calories which are energy 
for your body, otherwise it won't have the chemical energy to store said 
nutrients in your latent fat cells. Like, building up a pantry, or a squirrel

energy drinks and coffee will keep you awake, but they're a false promise, as 
once they're gone and digested your body's gonna crash harder. You'll have to 
sleep it off, like a hangover. But that's okay if you're getting somewhere and 
have a day to rest.

sugars found in fruit can give you a burst of quick energy, but they make you 
sleepy overtime. If this were a video game, they'd give +50 energy points but 
-1 per second for the next 100 seconds. Not ideal, but there's some vitamins 
that are only in fruit so it's a good idea to eat fruit at least once or thrice 
a week.

bread products are the opposite - they give you long-term energy. It takes your 
body longer to digest them, which means they're good for vitality. But they 
also don't have many nutrients, so don't forget your vegetables! Plus, more 
calories is always good if you've got time to spare. Just make sure you aren't 
using calories to store calories in your fat cells, that's like double-stacking 
condoms - not ideal. Store nutrients.

Highly recommend "Better than Boullion" - if your recipe involves boiling 
water, unless it's tea there's a good chance that some broth-in-a-jar could 
make it taste better.

Did you know you can boil oats like noodles? Yeah that's... that's basically 
how you make oatmeal. Use less water than with noodles, though.

EDIT: Also, add some bits of nutrition like dried fruit, nuts that have been 
soaking in clean water overnight, nutritional yeast, dehydrated soup mix 
(delicious), or frozen vegetables.

@OldAndCranky 

Hi. To answer your question, it depends entirely on what your capabilities are.

If you're mobile and social, try being somewhere public, repeatedly, ideally in 
different places. When you can, try talking to people. Say things like "Hey, 
did you hear what the Supreme Court did? They want to make Trump a king!" or 
"They just criminalized homeless people. A criminalized people is genocide." 
that kind of thing. You know, the cheery stuff. Save the hard topics for later.

Another thing you can do is start buying essential, important supplies, like 
sunscreen, nutritious granola bars, bullets, medical supplies, silicone-based 
mechanical lubricant (especially if you live somewhere rainy), batteries (AAA 
are best because you can use them for AA in a pinch) that kind of thing.

Another thing you can do is to talk to your friends 1-on-1 about how things are 
going. Your feelings are important but don't get hung up on them. Try to only 
go over them once or twice, DNRY.

Don't fear tears.

I personally think that it's better to act before the liberals have a chance to 
hand power over to the fascists.

when? well, that depends. Are you part of a large and massive organization that 
accomplishes great and beautiful things with incredible efficiency... but 
rather slowly? Then yeah get working. I'm sure you already are.

Are you just a person, like me? Then go do things that don't raise the 
temperature too much, but make you feel more confident and inspire those around 
you.

Like, bricks at cop cars is one way to go, but you're probably gonna get 
arrested. And then you're useless when we need you.

BUT if you meet with your friends and make plans for where to go, what to 
bring, who to know, and what to sing (if you're the musical types) then great! 
Go do that.

If you're reading this and thinking "I'm not gonna do that, I have a plan 
that's so much better" then yeah do that instead. I don't mind. Just... don't 
hurt innocent (ignorant) people, because if you do then you are my foe.

It's important to maintain a healthy sense of skepticism.

I mean, if George Washington himself suddenly appeared and said "Like King 
Arthur riding forth from the mists of Avalon, I have returned to ensure the

actor. Unless he's y'know still competent at military command, even though his

@neku 

I was born in the desert of New Mexico. My earliest memories are of cherry 
trees, chocolate, and blood.

I lived my childhood in Wyoming, on a small farm. I had legos, I had wooden 
swords, I could run and climb and jump and think and dream. I cried over math 
homework and I watched plants grow. I read every book in the library, well, at 
least all the good ones.

I lived my teen years in Colorado, in a suburb of the Mile High City. The first 
essay I ever wrote was a defence of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two communist 
spies who helped the Soviets keep American nuclear power in check. They were 
executed.

My first friend was like a sister to me.

The strongest community I've ever felt was my theatre class in high school. I 
loved each and every person there. We laughed, we played, we sang, we... grew 
up. And I never saw them again.

I dropped out of university four times, and I'm currently working on my fifth. 
My father told me to keep trying, but homework was never my strong suit. I'm a 
sprinter at heart

Hello kids, would you like to do some graffiti?

This kind is hard to take down. You can say all kinds of things, like your 
feelings about fascism or palestine or indigenous land back movements

but most people have already read that kind of thing, and they know where they 
stand.

Much better, I find, to talk about things that are more "of the times" - like, 
for example, how monarchy in America is on the rise.

Are you emotionally prepared for the feeling of swearing allegiance to a 
person, rather than a flag? I sure am looking forward to how we express these 
feelings!

Plus, genocide in palestine is old news to liberals, the only people who care 
that you share. But genocide here, in America, on our homeless, vagrants, and 
migrants? That's relatively new, that might get a glance or two.

Wheatpasting is harder to take down than post-its or spraypaint. But post-its 
and spraypaint are quicker to apply, so... use your best judgement. Be artistic!

Just woke up from a short nap.

I had a dream. I was riding on the subway, or maybe a light rail train, and 
inbetween stops a lady knocked on the window to be let in.

The train was stopped for some reason, perhaps to let another one through, so 
all it would have taken was to open the door.

I pushed the button. I talked to the operator. He wouldn't open the door.

The train started moving, and the woman started pleading. She ran alongside it 
as long as her elderly legs could carry her, but then there was another train 
behind her.

I saw her disappear between two and when mine stopped at the next legally 
designated spot, her little dog was sitting there, waiting for me, under a 
blanket made of her shawl. It was a dream, after all, and there were two more 
there comforting her. for the loss of her friend.

He could have opened the door. They wouldn't let him.

Last Words of a Shooting Star by Mitski (2014)

Lyrics:
All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom
And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
They'll think of me kindly
When they come for my things

They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room
With no thoughts
Like a blood-sniffing shark
And while my dreams made music in the night
Carefully
I was going to live

You wouldn't leave till we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
But I know through mine you were
Looking in yours

And did you know the liberty bell is a replica
Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night
Quietly
It was told to believe

I always wanted to die clean and pretty
But I'd be too busy on working days
So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
I couldn't have changed anyways

I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
Goodbye

I am a patriot, through and through. What does that mean, to you? To me, it 
means I think of the streams - the mountains, the trees. I love the dirt 
beneath my feet, from sea to shining sea.

We are a nation of all peoples. Everyone here was once from somewhere else, and 
that includes those who were thrust somewhere else by genocide - into tiny 
patches of dirt with no minerals, no farmland, no bountiful rivers, no towering 
pillars of rock.

Our flag is the flag of genocide. But it is also the flag of liberty, justice, 
and freedom for all*

you might be right, I don't know much about DSA aside from their numbers. To 
me, it feels like it's run sorta like a church? but again I have no idea 
because I've never been.

do you have a better idea?

as I rode my bike around yesterday, more and more I started to see a city full 
of badasses. you can tell from the look in their eyes, the way they walk, the 
things they say.

unrelated, but

the only reason the cops win at fights is because of their equipment.

the closer we get to parity, the more fucked they are, and they're already in 
deep shit.

the 4th of July was pretty awesome!

I made two friends, and I let a stranded stranger crash on my couch. I figure 
if I can trust someone I don't know enough for, say, a one-night-stand, then 
why not? don't worry, I used my best judgement. make sure you do, too.

also I got a knife under my pillow. helps a bit.

before the fireworks show, I saw some people under a bridge. I was given a 
water-bottle and a shrimp kebab, and it was delicious! things I overheard:

"no I haven't heard of that, but I'd like to know more"

... actually that's it, I didn't spend much time there because I had places to 
be. but from what I saw, that is exactly what we need. for now.

how do you best get people to talk? trick them into a family dinner teehee

@nus@mstdn.social 

if I had to take a lesson from this, it'd be that it's better to host somewhere 
else and be boosted by someone on the larger, sleepy servers. it's not their 
fault they didn't set an alarm, so they have no way to know what time it is. 
plus for some reason they get upset if you wake them up when you're roommates?

downside is, boosts only show up for followers, right? meaning you'll only be 
seen if you want to be seen, which means you gotta be roommates if you wanna be 
seen when they don't want to see. tricky tricky...

@Radical_EgoCom@mastodon.social 

yeah.

true.

though I think at a certain point, reformism kinda gets thrown out the window. 
the more people fight, the less they'll want to die for something old, and the 
more they'll want to reach for something bright.

@nus@mstdn.social @HeyItsRosie 

just gonna say you probably deserve that particular screenshotted block haha - 
imagine calling anarcho-nina a fed xD xD

plus that first "get the fuck out of my mentions" was a tip that went over your 
head, not a threat said in anger. she's pretty darn angry but that just means 
you don't wanna be in her way =P

... no the first tip was "stop replying to me, you already agree" and then the 
block was because you called her a fed =P

@Sobieck 

I can't reassure you about the "place", but the "times" are getting better. We 
stand now at the apex of their cruelty, and all it takes to reach the bright 
future is to keep moving forward.

unfortunately, the future always comes, but it comes unevenly and not fully 
distributed. but it will come to all, this I swear.

@shiri 

I know. Keep in mind, though, that the propagandic writing-on-the-wall cuts 
both ways. There are many more of us, than of them.

your first duty is to stay alive. plus, what you can do, you can do from 
anywhere, so long as the internet remains true. alas, has it ever been? but 
still it's up to you, what to do. no matter where you are, you'll find friends 
who will need your heart, your words, your kindness, and whatever other aid you 
may give.

I'm trans and relatively healthy and strong. in my legs at least. so my choice 
is a bit different than yours, mine becomes "die now, that others might live or 
die later, that others might die before me" and frankly that's not a choice at 
all.

@Sobieck 

protect your wife. if you can, be in a better "place" and wait for the "times" 
to move forward. the both of you are important for the world of tomorrow.

if the fascists take control, it won't matter that they'll come for her first. 
they must not take control.

@shrine 

that means you're walking the wrong way xD

consistency is important.

every face you see is another memory, another to help fill in your gaps.

we are not perfect, we are not immutable, which is why we must adapt to our 
troubles.

the road ahead is paved with good intentions, and once complete that road can 
allow for greater throughput of supplies and manpower.

where does it lead? we shall see, teehee.

does anyone know of any fedi software that lets you link to a particular post 
and read forward on a person's timeline from there? Or back I guess, but 
chronological viewing specifically.

if I don't take this job, then I'm going to be homeless.

if I do, then I'll be moving to a different city.

a city that I don't know.

my upbringing tells me that this isn't a choice at all, but... 

at least I have a place to keep my stuff. maybe I can find a different job.

live in the homes of those you agree with to make a difference.

pay rent, so that their goals may be furthered through your wage. the more you 
pay, the further they can go toward your shared goals.

if what you do doesn't pay well, then as long as your goals are similar and 
you're applying yourself then they might not mind you living there.

take care of your space, because every day that you do your roommates dishes is 
another day they can be working toward your shared goals.

talk to them, learn how they're doing what they do, and decide for yourself who 
you'd like to most contribute to.

the more friend groups you have, the more people you can connect to people who 
need to know things. people who can fix things. people who got your back.

it's hard to resist your heart's calling when you're flying through the air on 
a bike.

but then, rent comes due, and your bike is your new home. at least until it 
needs repair.

well, capitalism's always there, you could just try resisting your heart's 
calling!
