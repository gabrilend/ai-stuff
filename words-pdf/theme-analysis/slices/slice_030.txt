editing posts is great because you can say one thing, get a like or three, and 
suddenly you have a group chat pre-made for you. Sans notifications of course.

... that's way overkill though. who would even do that?

same people who boost one of your posts whenever they want you to look at the 
thing on their profile. If they want you to see the fourth thing down, they'll 
boost your 4th non-pinned post.

wow that's hardcore, who would even do that? Not me, that's for sure, I don't 
have time for that. (legitimately don't have the time nor the brainpower for 
that)

also liked posts are inadmissable in court because they can say one thing, then 
be edited to say another, and if you liked it once then you've liked it forever.

However the court of public opinion is a largely different matter, because 
people will generally believe anything a friend tells them.

computers are fun, aren't they? we should totally have more one-to-many posting 
methods that are collected in multiple locations and locally!

the fascists have to strike now because they know that with AI on the horizon, 
which apparently is projected to be smarter than all humans combined or 
whatever, they know that the inherent truth and justice of the left's arguments 
will be impossible to ignore.

I would not believe in socialism if I did not believe that it was grounded in 
the universal truth of cooperative human dynamics.

I believe in cooperation, humans, and dynamic systems.

Cooperation allows for greater things than an individual may provide

Humans are the most beautiful animal in all of creation, purely due to their 
habits, their adaptability, and their creativity.

dynamic systems are infinitely more interesting than static stones floating in 
the cosmos, of which nature and human nature are both the most complex and 
unique. Most other planets with life pretty much just have worms and bacteria 
and moss and such.

Earth has humans. We are Earth.

Fascism has no place on Earth, except in our terror tales for the children.

if the gods existed and had innumerable faces, I think most atheists would 
still be non-believers.

Not because they didn't believe that the gods existed - they've been 
scientifically proven in this reality, remember?

but rather because they did not want to worship. And that's totally 100% okay 
and should be encouraged, because a tithe is a vote and a prayer is a donation

The illuminati is boring. "oh no a bunch of humans are pulling all the strings" 
how trivial. Just eat the humans and they can't be puppeteers anymore, now can 
they?

much more interesting to me is to organize yourself against the Greek Choir. 
Though since they can read all your thoughts, you can hardly plan against them, 
can you? And some of those voices in your head with your own voice are them, 
after all, so can you truly trust your own intentions?

so weird how "you" in your words becomes "whichever social media platform 
you're currently typing into" when you post a lot (like, all the time)

it's like this semi-para-social relationship thing. is there a different kind 
of "para" that means, like... in relation to the means of communication rather 
than the person on the other end?

maybe like... "meta", meaning discussing the topic of discussing the topic. In 
this case of course it'd be... discussing the medium upon which the discussion 
is taking place.

but it's not really about the medium, is it? It's anthropomorphizing the 
medium, giving it a face, or at least a persona of some kind, and speaking 
directly to it.

(of course, "it" means "all the people who follow you and who are cursed to 
wander upon you in the local feed)

so... athro-meta-socializing mastodon means that you toot about whatever, but 
directed toward the entity that you know and are talking to: "mastodon", which 
to you is something completely different than it is to everyone else. huh~

a reason that online discourse and activism doesn't work is because boosting or 
re-tweeting something doesn't cause people to see more of that particular thing 
unless you consistently boost / retweet those things. This means that unless 
people go out of their way to self-select as someone who follows the person you 
boosted, there's little future impact on their lives. And the people who are 
most likely to do so are the people who are probably already following those 
people

social media isn't a community, it's a scene. Meaning there's little contact 
between fellow members of a particular topic or discourse.

like, if you go to /r/prequelmemes you're gonna talk about star wars. But 
you'll rarely talk about how you butter the sandwich, or whether you believe in 
a direct approach, a flanking maneuver, or a slower 
more-defensive-but-ramping-in-power build.

so, if you and another person care about the same "activism" then you'll 
probably see the same things as someone who also does. So you grow apart, RIP

I think too fast. If given unlimited power, I'd literally think myself into 
catastrophe because I need to explore all the possible alternatives. Including 
the catastrophe ones. But by thinking something, you manifest it - because you 
have unlimited power, right? EVERYTHING you do is powerful. There's no way to 
control that! So it cannot be, for it has not been. And surely, surely, shall 
not either. Surely, right?

... good news is you can undo it just as easily, all you have to do is forget 
what you were doing and go back to your neutral state. Sure would be neat if 
some kind of machination or parasite could hit your reset switch every couple

if you only have a phone, you can still program. Just write it out on paper, 
and put the whole program out on the floor.

Screens will never compare, for they are but a tiny keyhole into the total 
program at hand. And you can pick parts of it up and carry them around - so 
useful! You could make an entire building out of that. [floorplan, layout, that 
kind of thing]

downside is, of course, you don't have a computer, so you have to look up 
syntax on your phone.

and eventually you're gonna have to type it, unless you can get a computer to 
read it for you.

just imagining office buildings where employees can follow along with monitors 
on the wall that explains what they're working on and what they need to resolve

then they meet up with a bunch of other humans and they hash things out

people will generally go about their daily lives as if nothing has changed so 
long as nothing for them has changed.

If you want to compel action, their lives must be made different somehow. Even 
if that's just... talking to them outside of the grocery store. A little bit 
can go a long way.

And when they do end up acting, I think you'll find that it's in your favor.

there are plenty of pieces of linux that are insecure in some way. Including 
x11, if I remember correctly. It is purely convention to not abuse these 
insecurities, and whenever you use someone else's binary software you trust 
that they won't betray you in some way.

pre-built binaries are privacy violations and should be illegal. They are 
security threats because the model they're built upon is necessarily insecure. 
Computers will never be completely secure because of how they are built, and so 
we should use locally compiled software and interpreted scripts.

Unless they're too long, or impossible to read. Who reads EULAs these days? At 
least those are written in english.

maybe computers aren't worth it. Maybe computers will solve all our problems. 
Who can say, maybe you should ask an oracle like me

though do remember that anything you hear can and will be used against you,

fediverse software that doesn't notify someone when you boost their post

people are so used to "liking" things to better inform their algorithm that 
when they get to fediverse and realize there's no mechanical impact of "liking" 
things they don't know how to use it anymore. So they generate their own 
meaning, which is different to everyone.

So to one person, liking something might mean "send read receipt" for another 
it might mean "I'm gonna save this forever and ever" and for another person it 
could mean "hey I think you're cool and I agree with this"

same for boosting, people think it's "I want to share this" and others think 
it's "I want to say this in your voice" and for others it's "this needs to be 
heard by my followers in particular" and it's just... a whole thing

even replies are complicated, do they mean you want to say what you feel or are 
they part of the post now, and should be curated by the original poster? it's 
too complicated!

we could accomplish so much, but capitalism.

hmmmm, maybe we should identify the highest output members of our team and 
like, reduce or eliminate their worries so they can apply themselves fully and 
completely?

for every shackle we break, the struggle becomes easier. The hardest part is 
the beginning - once the ball is rolling, we may truly shine.

there is no government nor circle of autocrats who may resist the will of an 
impassioned people. So long as the military does not deny us our right to 
organize ourselves as we will, according to the constitution they swore to 
uphold (which is now in peril, I might add), nothing can contain us.

no acts of god nor capital shall prevent our ascension. They will try, and 
it'll be just another thing that we have to handle.

But we can take care of each other. For we are good, and we are kind, and we 
are cooperative. And so, we cannot be overcome.

... just watch out for those who prey on goodness, kindness, and cooperation. 
They may hamper us.

violence is legal in self-defence.

punching nazis is self defence?

it's communal defence, for they present a clear and present danger to the 
community.

You know the guy in the vietnam movies who shows up and fires over the enemy's 
head because he doesn't want to kill anyone? That's justified, though it might 
mean he'd die.

He isn't fighting in communal defence. His community was safe from the 
vietnamese farmers and countryfolk who wanted nothing to do with imperialism, 
only to govern themselves their way. Too bad that sounds like communism, and 
the USSR was keen on funding the most violent amongst them if it meant another 
state for capitalism to contest.

Nazis are not farmers. They are not countryfolk. They wear suits and they 
deceive these people into fighting for them. They are liars and they enslave 
the minds of those they can catch in their web of despair.

random chance it just decided to visit our part of the solar system

so they decided to test and see if god exists

by not telling anyone and seeing if anyone would save us

rather than risk the potential capability to prove without a doubt that a god 
did truly exist, (essentially, invoking divine intervention) they chose to work 
out a technical or otherwise humanly possible way of avoiding harm. in this 
case (or as some call it, meta-confluential scenario), by sacrificing

tips for escaping a fey dimension:

if you notice one, find some rope and a way to secure it. then, search for the 
edge of the anomalous area, and feel where the first indication is that 
something is "fey" or "other" than what you're used to.

then, circle around the strange object in question, and try to find the exact 
opposite side. keep in mind it may not be an exact circle, and it may be more 
twisty-windy on the inside. You don't have to go too far, just enough to close 
the purse-snap-close-locket by finding the other edge and dragging your rope 
across.

because from a rope, you can develop other platforms and emplacement-ologies, 
which may be used to close and secure the strange place that you found.

once on the other side, you can secure your rope and then search for your 
superiors. Keep in mind that if it's a chaotic dimension, it's probably best to 
just keep it closed. but if it's musing or wistful, you can have little 
interactions on the border.

also, you can dive in to rescue your kin, if secured.

growing up, my family were the most commonly marginalized group of people I can 
think of: outsiders

we came to develop friendships, and we found some. But their grandparents 
didn't have any stories about us, so we were thought of less.

and then we moved away.

to the city, where my father had developed wanderlust.

we lived in the suburbs just north-south of the east-west highway.

it was different, but sorta the same. My parents wanted to give me more space 
to roam. on a farm homestead it's much more controlled but on a smaller scale. 
Then, in the city, the equivalent of that is either to live in the mountains or 
the barns, and both of those are a-typical experiences.

difficult to start up business in the middle of the fields. most people just 
tend to themselves.

Some of my most wanderful times were when I lived in a gated community.

My parents were dumb, and thought, as most people thought, that harm to a child 
can only come from outside of the community.

But they fell for the lies of property, where "community" means less of "a 
group of people who cares and tends for one another" the kind of which my 
parents had never truly known, and more like "this particular residential area 
on the map"

which means I could walk around in this gated "community" where the gates are 
little more than security theatre for anyone who says "Hi I got a pizza here 
for this address which I found on google maps" or "hey I left my sweatshirt at 
my sister's house and it has my phone in it, ummmm no I don't remember which 
number her house is, nor do I remember her last name"

in those times, I developed a sense of freedom, caged as I was, that for most 
comes much later in their time.

whether you eat halloween candy by the handful or savor each and every bite, 
what matters most for tooth decay is duration

1 person who spends 2 hours eating a snickers bar is going to get more cavities 
than someone who spends 10 minutes eating 22.

but your stomach doesn't care when you ate them, only that you ate quite a few. 
Meaning you're likely to either get sick, or put on a pound or twenty-two.

I think it's better to try many different tiny little treats, but always 
remember that the time you spend consuming bits of the sugar dimension add up, 
and eventually your time will come to resign yourself to a fate with little 
candy remaining, for you've grown too old for such childish things as tasty 
yummy splendor.

old, or fat. Heh heh heh, can you imagine that? your belly sticks out from 
under your hat! how cute. But dearie, dont you know that every pound you bear 
is another that you have to carry around with you? It can be useful sometimes

what if shopping malls (and outdoor malls too) were owned by a union (that was 
part of a larger meta-union (which was part of a national union)) comprised of 
ONLY the employees who worked at that mall.

They could cross-train themselves and work wherever they wanted on that day, so 
long as they filled out their schedule a week in advance. If they didn't care 
they could just show up and be assigned wherever they were needed, including 
doing back-end work like accounting and managing union business.

would be nice if they could have access to all the capabilities of the 
businesses in the mall / marketplace. Need some clothes? Go to the TJ Maxx. 
Want some food? There's a korean barbecue place that you're trained at, go make 
yourself some food.

So long as you get someone else to write your name down, the union can tell if 
you overuse or waste it.

I think this would give them more power over their environment and develop the 
space for them to talk to one another and communicate about larger 
organizational plans.

keeps them from using their old skills.

if the new tools do not accomplish the same goal, then the worker is not truly 
obsolete. They are simply in the wrong job at the wrong time, but that's easy 
enough to fix by simply putting them in the right job. It's always the right 
time somewhere.

if the election goes poorly, keep in mind that eventually everyone will either 
fight, or support those who are fighting.

everyone.

if the election upholds the status quo, there is a chance that their wounds 
might heal and they may rejoin us in our reasonable society.

keep working for reason. it will pay off in the long run. remember that a 
better world is possible, but you can't leave anyone alive behind when reaching 
for it.

@burnoutqueen 

... No matter how much you manipulate matter, there is still going to be the 
same amount of grams if you keep it within a closed system.

Capital is much the same way. One does not truly "produce" value. All one can 
do is apply energy to the material contents of the Earth in order to transform 
it into something useful. ...

it sounds like you are referring to our collective ownership of the earth, as 
humans, who are the fruit of mother nature's most prolific and complicated 
leaves.

we are all alone here together on this ball of rock, might as well use the 
minerals and sunlight to build ourselves a garden of eden. We built computers - 
what other wonders might our technologies unlock?

If only we cared for each other and shared with each other and did what we 
could to keep U.S. from rot

ah, well, it's a dog-eat-dog world, a sentiment I learned recently from my 
father, the capitalist over a month-early thanksgiving dinner. Clearly we can 
create more rocks by working harder >.>

@VisualStuart 

democracy works best with a well-informed populace, and those who are against 
democracy would do anything to make it harder to be "well-informed" - including 
diluting the pool of candidates in order to make it harder to research them.

... Or maybe it was the first time and none of the candidates realized they'd 
be running against so many people? I'm not sure, I'm on the other side of 
forest park and I had at most 5ish options, and no ranked choice voting. : (

I think this might be one of the reasons political parties formed, way back in 
the distant days of yore. Much easier to say "I agree with this group of people 
so I'm voting for who they champion" than "I don't know how to pick between 30+ 
candidates (who I don't know because this is the past and we don't have the 
internet back then ... back now)

@smitten 

maybe the user could tell their client what fields to expect and how to present 
them (like, a field called "memes" would be presented as a picture in this 
panel, a field called "rants" would be passed to a word-cloud function that 
extracts the most common 6+ letter words so you can tell at a glance what the 
rant is about, this other field could be for calendar invites (plain text of 
course, but interpreted by the calendar program) etc)

plus, if it's encrypted with PGP keys by default, there'd be few security 
concerns. Unless your friend got hacked, or you got hacked, but, well... make 
sure everything's sandboxed and don't do any remote code execution and you're 
good, right?

what if we added a tier between cities and states and said that all "big 
cities" had the government that the states once had, the states had the 
government that the nation once had, and some new awesome other kind of 
government replaces the federal one

the world is just too big for a nation the size of ours. there's too many 
people, too many problems, and too great are the differences between us - we 
need another layer of abstraction to handle this mess.

to turn it on and it worked for some reason?? and tonight I just got it all

if you wear a quilt upon your skin as you sleep each night, you will inevitably 
find that it has grown yellow from the sweat, that it is worn from the 
friction, that it frays from the toenails, and it thins from the moisture. 
You'll need to wash it, which damages it still, and soon you'll find yourself 
replacing it - this heirloom you deliver to landfill.

but, if you wear a sheet underneath, you'll find that all you need to wash and 
replace is a thin piece of fabric.

democracy is a quilt, society is the stuffing that keeps you warm, and voting 
is the sheet underneath that works to keep things clean.

unless, of course, you sneak into your ex-husbands house while he's at work and 
spread grease on-top of the sheet. If you fill his warmth with butter he might 
find it harder to vote his way out of a damaged quilt.

the rich are the butter, and I'll leave the other question to the reader - 
who's doing the sneaking? why are they so interested in fraying our quilt?

oh right, they want to prove their god
