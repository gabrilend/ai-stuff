food tastes better with more nutrients in it.

when food is grown with the bare minimum soil, and bred to look better but 
uptake fewer nutrients, it will taste worse because your taste buds light up 
for vitamins but sleep for textures and colors.

Massive monocrop algriculture has allowed us to feed billions of people (well, 
not all of them) and yet it's unhealthy because the soil is tilled, killing the 
vibrant ecosystem that lives in all soil, and then it is supplemented with 
specific nutrients that cause plants to fruit faster and larger.

But larger isn't always better. much the same way that hardwood is slower 
growing as it takes longer to deposit the carbon and nutrients in the denser 
walls of the bark, so too is fast-growing food less healthy as there's less 
time to uptake nutrients (that might not even be present in the soil)

food tastes better when it's good for you.

I promise.

The American diet is primarily sugar and meat, with flavoring added and 
processing for texture. But there is a better way.

if I were on stage at a pride parade:

"hi, you guys know Pride is a protest, right? Well, this time's different, 
because protests only work against democracies, and they only sorta work then.

This time though, we're not up against a democracy, so Pride is not a fucking 
protest.

Okay okay bear with me - what if each and everyone one of us met up here in a 
week and drove up to Seattle? Then, we gathered everyone we could, and marched 
our cars down through every city on the west coast. When we hit the border, we 
would drive to Texas, and once there we would march in every city in the street 
chanting "We're here, if you're queer, come with us or they'll fucking kill

then, we could hit every city in the south, and upon arriving in Philadelphia 
we could take a break, ensure everyone has a place to stay, and then disperse

people naturally differentiate themselves from their peers as they grow up.

well, some grow attached to role models, but in that case they differentiate 
themselves from their peers by being an adherent to the role model, not the 
role model itself. And if there's multiple, you can bet one is the shy one and 
one is the gregarious one. Or other similar contrast.

this simple fact is key to the hypocrisy of fascism. It's so simple, and yet 
their demand for conformity is their downfall. For people will naturally become 
themselves, and their "self" is naturally different than the people around them.

the world they so dearly cling to is an oroborous - a snake eating it's tail.

however... it is also the source of fascism. For if everyone is kind, there 
will be one, perhaps some, who are hateful. This is natural, but it's not... 
ideal.

As a person grows up, their choices reflect what they believe. They may choose 
to be hateful, or they may choose to be prideful. I rather pride than hate.

hi, so... yeah I'm a strange person

it's tough to get to know me

and this probably feels cringe to read

but I once heard you should kill the part of you that cringes

so... here's me

I'm 

================================================== stack overflow ==============

... where was I? oh yes and THAT's when the nail went through the roof, and it
    scared the heck out of... wait, what was I talking about? OH yes so anyway

I was born in the cool summer of 1864 - there was a rustling breeze that held a
steady note for the entire evening, and into this world I arose. [awoke?]

my mother held me but for a moment before I was whisked away to be cleaned and
cared for. this was unusual for the time, as most mothers clutched their
children to their breasts. But alas, I alone was spared her touch, and so I was
cast (as if in bronze) as my own volition.

as I had grown, I heard tales of distant times, and assumed they were places you
could go. Then, when my time came to wander, I found nought of what I had grown
most fonder - though I did find plenty else, besides.

Instead, times are places we travel through, as a cripple might ride on a cart.
across the sea, through lands of mystery, viewable only from the road. In 1864
that's how other lands you'd come to know.

As I travelled from place to place, it felt as if a stage had been cast, with a
single actor or three illuminated as a spotlight. "Here, pay attention to me,
I'm here for the story and the plot!" though often I'd glance around, and hear
mostly my own thoughts, I grew to learn to appear.

different themes, different tales, if you want to see a most marvelous scene,
take a baby to Disney World and only pay attention to what they're looking at.

My grandfather worked there, so in my first year or so I spend a LOT of time
there. My parents were very dedicated to raising me, I appreciate every moment
of it. Which... Is probably not a good thing to say on a transfemme server,
oops I should delete that part [esc->k->k->k->0->v->shift(held)->G->$->"->*]

also I should mention I'm stoned as fuck this is just what I do

the downside of Proton and Lutris is now the ONLY games that work on Steam are 
either continually updated (untenable) or playable on Lutris or Proton. Same 
thing with Wine, though there's always at least one decent substitute.

kinda makes me want to write a manager-style program which runs programs using 
whichever version of their git repository would work best for their system / 
configuration / purposes. Idk how I would start working on that though.

I bet you could make one that acted like a shop, but where you didn't charge 
any dollars. You could like... "swipe" through UI options, and pick whichever 
felt most useful for your setup. Like, how some people use i3 and some use dwm

with maybe inspectors that are modeled off of video-game style "options" GUIs 
that mainly correspond to flags on the command/terminal line or compilation 
flags

I feel like that kind of abstraction would make it a lot easier for users to 
adjust their system. they're noobs, after all. gotta show them all the choices

just wanna say that the reason Biden gives arms to Israel is so they can 
contest Saudi Arabia and others.

we also buy a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia, because that's their primary export.

they are a rich nation because of their natural resources, which would 
otherwise be stagnant under the desert, and so this gives us (through them) the 
right to pollute our atmosphere and melt the bones off of people at the equator 
(in however many years)

however, if the military (we've built) combined with the economy (we sustain) 
then they could dominate any players in the region. Thus, a new kingdom 
ascendant, which is kinda their long-term plan. gotta have a foe to pit your 
citizens against, or else they'll never listen to you.

sometimes your best intuitions don't manage to manifest the goal you've been 
pursuing. that's okay, it just means you need a different approach.

hopefully, with experience, you've had the chance to continually pay attention. 
Thus, improve on things that were originally conceived of as concessions.

much better, I find, to point your idea of "truth" toward what you believe in, 
rather than what you've been working with. Such an approach allows for 
continual re-examination, justified by thoroughly moral and ethical conclusions 
that you hold to be true.

every social media platform is an echo chamber. we learned this the hard way on 
Reddit as we saw them develop on their respective subreddits.

However, we had a useful tool called a "front page" where all the subreddits 
you were subscribed to were present. This was great because it allowed you to 
compare and contrast various echo chambers and cross-post things between them.

I do believe that the healthiest way to use the internet as it currently exists 
is to have one main social media site and 2-4 other sidekick sites where you 
share things you found on your main site.

This approach allows for cross-pollination of ideas. Just make sure that you 
keep finding new people to talk to everywhere you go, and you'll do fine.

doctors (the ones who are diagnosing autism) don't care about classifying

Instead they try and classify symptoms, and if you don't present any negative

I think it'd be neat if Mastodon boosted posts that someone had personally 
seen. like, adding a degree of separation to knowing people - if you follow 
someone, you'll hear what their friends are saying.

so, like, if you subscribe to someone, you will see them boosting the posts 
that their friends made. or at least the people they're following.

in doing so, you can always know everyone that someone is connected to. which 
is more than enough to determine how true and honest they are.

(ideally with a way to filter out duplicates - like perhaps an icon of the 
persons face at the bottom to show they also saw it? and so they have mutual

if you live for 5-10+ minutes, you can learn a lot of interesting things about 
how to engage a foe.

like, the importance of cover at all times, until you successfully outmaneuver 
your foe.

when an enemy approaches, don't step out to meet them

wait for them to attack, and then throw explosive devices at them. easy peasy.

or, y'know, bullets

you cannot defeat an enemy head on - that's why the world wars were so 
devastating, we put ALL our soldiers at 100% on ALL flanks. We had to to 
contest the foe who was doing the same thing.

it is mindboggling how many people died. The utmost scale of destruction that 
should ever yet be. because they were never allowed to outmaneuver their foe.

a good way to strike is to feint your foe, and let your foe enroach on your 
edge, spreading their surface area across a large, thin, useless piece of land.

basically, make them fight a bit of the land war in asia in your borders.

then, you can strike at the hinge, where they are weaker

I can write C in Rust, but I can't write Rust in any other language.

there's a lot of unique semantic options for accomplishing things that I

manual assignments, no more than 4 or 5 levels of function nesting.

I like to use threads and arrays, and think about in-game simulation more like 
a calculation than an input-reacting device. though input would certainly be 
encouraged to make the simulation more precise.

the borrow checker gets in my way, but that's not too big of a problem - I just 
have to copy a bit more data around. Easy peasy.

@Raeve 

have you ever wanted to design your own MMO? If you think you can make a 
client, there's a server already set up which interfaces with World of 
Warcraft. So... the hardest part is done, and suddenly the rest is about as 
hard as making any other game.

The reason I ask is because there's no open-source client for the WoW engine 
server software Azerothcore, but if written then there could be a whole new 
field of indie design as solo developers would be able to build their own 
multiplayer games with ease.

well, as easy as making a game in Godot at least. That's the dream. I don't 
think I could build such an engine, but I spend an awful lot of time thinking 
about how engines are built.

There's a lot of freedom in the design space, for example this mod server I 
made which emulates Risk of Rain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HsW4g2ZIgk

It has randomized enemies, treasure chests, wandering vendors, and deployable 
hearthstones. If you've played WoW that stuff might ring a bell, otherwise it's 
probably just random features

I'd LOVE a game which taught toki pona!!

You've brought some of this up before. I'm uninterested in co-opting some 
existing thing in a way I then can't support myself off of.

Well my points are these:

MMOs are difficult because of the added complexity in their networking

an open source networking solution exists

however no open source client solution exists

but one could be written, which is about as hard as making a game using Bevy or 
Raylib or Love2D, and if one were written, then games could easily be made 
on-top of them which you would then support yourself off of. I mean... I'd want 
to support myself too haha, and I can think of like 100 different games that 
could be made in an engine like that.

the idea is that by opening up more design space you can apply your ideas as an 
early pioneer in a particular design direction that hasn't been able to be 
explored because the up-front investments in making an MMO are huge.

Meanwhile, with this system you could script them in Lua very easily.

that sounds like a different application than what I was talking about (it's

and I'm just going off of what I've heard. Like... the "don't make an MMO 
because you'll spend forever building the server code and won't ever get around 
to making the actual game" sentiment that is prevalent in the industry. I guess 
I'm just saying that with the open source advancements we've made (specifically 
with Azerothcore and Eluna) we can use the design of the best MMO ever made as 
a starting point and branch off from there roughly as easily as making another 
kind of game from scratch.

Kinda was always the allure of Blizzard games to me, the idea that they were 
super duper modable.

if you want to store something in RAM, declare a variable.

if you want to store something on DISK, create a file with the value of the

work on files in addition to variables

used 4 digit numbers for it's variables and you would have to write down what

lateral numbers, AKA "imaginary" numbers (they aren't imaginary they're just 
orthogonal to regular numbers - hence, lateral)

and like... the math worked, and it was all on a T9 keyboard.

I figure each memory location would be like, a function written in the program, 
or perhaps a binary or script file in a nearby directory. by writing a value to 
a certain coordinate, you are giving an input value to a function.

and if nothing is stored for that particular coordinate, then the command fails 
to execute and nothing happens.

@Raeve

it's impossible for a genre to die. they just go stagnant, as other styles of 
art rise around them, waiting for the day when the other styles give insight 
into the stagnant style's design.

they say that there are no unique ideas, and that you should combine 2-3 ideas 
from different genres to create a decent gameplay loop. I personally disagree, 
but when seeking to revive a "dead" genre you just need to pull in mechanics 
from other games. Games which didn't exist when the genre "died".

For example, deckbuilders did not exist by the time RTS games "died". And yet 
new strategy games are being made all the time, some incorporating deckbuilding 
elements.

Really, a genre only "dies" when the market is saturated by a bunch of 
corporations piling in on a specific formula that "works" (like how every RTS 
made between 2000 and 2010 was either a C&C clone or a Warcraft III clone) - 
this saturation causes people to stop buying strategy games.

 -> file: fediverse/3047.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@Raeve 

specifically in relation to MMOs, I think the scaling aspects of the genre have 
never truly been utilized. Even something as simple as Agar.io (or similar, 
can't remember any names teehee) with massive amounts of people (I later 
learned they were bots, whoops) can utilize scale quite well, if implemented 
well.

The Massive part of MMO is valuable I believe, which is a big reason why I like 
games that scale like Supreme Commander and Factorio.

The Multiplayer part of MMO is valuable because multiplayer brings randomized 
outcomes, which are always more fun than playing against bots. Multiplayer 
combined with Massive gives room for community, but only if the game is 
designed to encourage it.

Online... you can't have multiplayer without online haha

I believe you can make massive games with very few players, and you can make 
intensely isolating games with lots of players (like WoW today)

and the middle ground in old WoW where guilds are required to do anything 
worked well for a while, but no longer.

I really do like the idea of only being able to speak in toki pona. How are you 
enforcing that? Using sitelen pona? how do you type, by pointing at a grid of 
characters? or just... by typing? what happens when someone types english?

20-30 players per instance is definitely not Massivetm but it still sounds like 
you're building systems which emphasize socialized play. I like that, I believe 
it's always important to have players contributing toward a larger community. 
It builds a sense of solidarity, and gives you chances to identify ways that 
people sabotage such systems (by, for example, wasting resources or being 
greedy) which is an interesting cultural experiment, I think.

I thought it was an MMO because you pitched it in relation to the MMO I 
designed =P

also the server software I described is an emulation project first, generic MMO 
software second, as it needs to be since it lacks a client. If a client was 
designed, that limitation could be removed. That's really all I'm trying to

when designing systems, give people the opportunity to be shitty in a 
controlled way. In a way that doesn't hurt people, but still lets them get 
their feelings out there.

like, free fireworks for arsonists if they use them in the middle of the 
desert. Or a punching bag for people with rage issues, complete with a little 
vinyl pocket to store a picture of someone they're frustrated with.

If people go out of their way to hurt people otherwise, then they are bad 
people and should have their power removed from them and supplied with love, 
affection, and therapy until they get better. And if they don't... well, prison 
I guess, until they reconsider.

And by prison I of course mean something that respects their human dignity and 
gives them opportunities to grow and change - all it removes is their freedom, 
so... "attention everyone, it's now mandatory finger-painting hour, report the 
art room or else you'll get electric shocks in your shock collar" that kind of 
thing.

If you want freedom, you must deserve it

@burnoutqueen 

exactly!

something immoral like not voting against fascism!

... okay maybe not the best example, but yes I agree you should only lose 
freedom if you demonstrably hurt people. And that freedom should not take with 
it your right to a happy, healthy, and safe life with community and love.

Innocent until proven guilty becomes a lot easier with global surveillance, but 
with global surveillance there can be no unethical actions. And sometimes, to 
escape local minima, unethical actions are required.

Though I'd rather build a ladder to climb out of a pit than a drill-dozer that 
explores through the graph.

... these days it kinda feels like drills are our only option, though. I feel 
less so that way after Kamala Harris became the presumptive nominee over Biden.

@Raeve 

yes you could certainly use a database for that, but databases are 
significantly more complex.

For a game, yeah a database is a good idea. especially if it's a multiplayer 
game.

For a script or small program, use small files to store data.

I personally like the idea of "plain-text" files because it allows your users 
to modify them if need be, while databases tend to be more locked down.

@Raeve 

true. the "massively multiplayer" aspect of WoW is about as important to the 
game as the "A" is in "ARPG".

I can't help but feel like the "impromptu groups" functionality feels a bit 
better than matchmaker instancing... though anything worth running a group for 
in WoW after TBC was instanced >.>

Honestly I think there's just too many games these days for people to really 
get "into" MMORPGs, unless they're sufficiently unique in their mechanics (like 
EVE or Runescape)

any ARPG MMOs are dead on launch, as you said. That design space is tapped out, 
at least for now, until someone comes along and makes it a deckbuilding 
roguelike or whatever. cough cough

I feel like if I wanted to keep every single one of my games playable I'd have 
to boot them up at least once every 3 months or so.

That's EXHAUSTING. Linux is supposed to "just work" - so why does everything 
break every time you run an update?

WHY can't I just... maintain a copy of old software if it's still in use? Or 
like, include all the installation steps that check for dependencies (and 
install them if necessary) into the "launch game" script?

Backwards compatibility for a single season ago is apparently too much. I've 
written a few scripts for it but you can only do so much when the game files 
aren't on github -.-

@wyatt8740 

I live in a tech hub area with lots of hardware development.

I've thought for a while that someone who's really into retro-tech could 
absolutely make a killing by going to old-folks-homes and giving workshops or 
presentations about tech that the people who live there might recognize.

Just a thought, I don't know who you'd have to talk to to get that ball rolling 
but TBH anything that keeps their minds active is probably something worth 
pursuing.

@wyatt8740 

solicitation brings to my mind the idea of a person walking in the front door 
and talking to the receptionist, and if that's what you tried then I'm not 
surprised it didn't work.

But maybe if you knew someone higher up it might get a bit more traction? 
Ideally for a place that already does workshops of some kind.

@winter 

yes that is true! And though they'd never realize nor admit it, the republicans 
are oppressed too.

Some day we will liberate them, and they will realize what utter douche-nozzles 
they've been. Their harm will be done, of course, but since there are more of 
us than them, we can live through their hatred and come out the other side 
toughened with resolve.

they have nothing but anger. They will collapse under their own weight. The 
oppressors cannot oppress for much longer, all we have to do is wait.

re-reading what you wrote, your point was that it's unfair that republicans are

and I was saying that if those limitations were removed, the democrats would 
win in a landslide everywhere in the country, which gives me faith in my fellow
