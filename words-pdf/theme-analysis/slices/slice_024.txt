the trick to strategy is to overcome your weaknesses with minimal expenditure 
of resources. Making better decisions optimizes for the most optimal 
performances.

practice makes perfect.

just as there are infinite anti-derivatives of zero, (the derivative of any 
constant (the derivative of any number of equations)) so too are there infinite 
perspectives from which you can perceive the same object. Therefore, no 
understanding can be assumed to be true, as the path you are on only speaks in 
adjacents. almost any things.

like the tips of a triforce moving outward from a central point.

and the people, the other half of our minds,

those are the ones you speak to. The thoughts that run alongside your mind.

an eternal orbit, like two stars spinning and rotating and [lol I've been 
instructed to stop, brb gonna play some video games =P]

insert a carriage return character) unless you held [ctrl] which was the "I

@courtcan @nocontexttrek 

if you developed a viewer application that described any object in a room that 
a blind person examined using the software, you could allow them to navigate 
through a scene and picture the story as if it were happening around them. All 
you'd need to do is give them the option to say "okay hold up. Describe the man 
on the left." or "and how were the teacups arranged?" and "does the angle of 
the impact seem to be angled toward the window?" that kind of thing

interpreting text is something that's been automated. It should be trivial to 
run a simple and cheap LLM that identified which object they were referring to 
based on their words. There might not even be that much lag if you analyze 
their keystrokes and build up understanding based on them while they're typing 
out the full message. sorta like, someone listening to a person explain 
something, or describe a particular scene or tale.

@nocontexttrek @courtcan 

Oh yes and human curated descriptions are always more interesting than just... 
describing the picture. Humans can offer nuance, and explain more intricate or 
contextual things, drawing attention where it's most important and highlighting 
the implications of expression, environment, and motion in a way that a 
computer just... can't.

The only issue would be that in the context of the program I described, there 
will always be questions that a human hasn't written a transcription for. It's 
easy with Star Trek captions, because there's only one camera angle so you only 
have to describe a single viewpoint. But blind people don't always... "see" 
through cameras the ways that sighted people do. It's more of an "aura of 
perception" that they feel around themselves.

Being able to walk around in a space (think like, VR without the headset) and 
question various aspects of a scene would be so cool

Star Trek is perfect for this since there is very little movement, it's mostly 
about thought

dear ritz: it's not that your thoughts are too long for other people to hear

it's that your thoughts are too long for your own RAM

you need to stop orbiting around your point in an attempt to highlight it using 
negative space, and instead focus on tapping it lightly over and over again.

remember, just like the anti-derivative of zero, there are infinite 
perspectives that a person can take when reading what you write. So they will 
necessarily see what's on the "other side" of your orbit as something different 
than what you're trying to circle in red pen and underline.

stack overflowing and it's like... okay, great. "babe why did you stop you had

Why are you buying bumper stickers and flair? You could be spending that on 3d

Unrelated, but companies are wasting their time at pride. Wanna know how you 
can help? Pick 15 attendees and pay for their entire Amazon wishlists. Then, 
have a competition with all the other companies for fame and prestige of who 
bought the best gifts (that are explicitely asked for and randomly assigned) 
while they work to secure the rest of the things they need. The things that 
can't be bought, the things which utilize gifts from Amazon shopping lists, the 
organizations and groups of people working toward a common goal. The common 
goal that queer people share, the liberation of all of mankind. Corporations 
could actually help them work toward that by tangibly improving their material 
conditions. Like by buying everything on their Amazon wishlists. (that's just 
an example, doesn't have to be amazon, but that kind of vibe. Giving them 
everything they have previously had need of, but couldn't access. The idea 
being that they would then implement those newfound capabilities, through their 
own usage or in the guided manipulations of another's will. Like a teacher to a 
child, bringing forth understandings the child may use in their future lives, 
people may be given new capabilities and taught how to use tools that the 
teacher might have placed on their Amazon shopping list, and were subsequently 
provided by a corporation sponsoring a small segment of pride, but did not 
possess the time to use. They may possess the functionality (skills and muscle 
memory and such) yo utilize those new tools, but without the time to do so they 
cannot. So, they might teach another, who then might provide the same impulse 
that the sponsored person (with the fulfilled Amazon wishlist) was initially 
guided. (by). Like, if bought a 3D printer, I might spend a hundred hours 
learning how to do it, I might spend 50 if I was taught one-on-one. But someone 
who already knows how to use it could use it (have it instead) and fulfill the 
need that I had which initially encouraged me to reach for a 3D printer I 
neither possessed not owned nor could operate. The need remains, and may be 
fulfilled by the person who was given the 3D printer who can use the 3D printer 
by the person who was fulfilled it from their Amazon wishlist by the 
corporation who believed in the same common goal as the queer liberation of 
humanity and eternity.

An image means nothing, for it is just an icon.

like a picture of a floppy disk corresponding to writing memory from RAM into a 
hard disk platter, even tho those have three different tasks, so too does my 
icon gesture at something.

On the other hand, art is necessarily divorced from it's meaning the moment it 
leaves the pen and is written to paper. So there cannot be a meaning in my 
flag, not one that I define of course.

The observers of the artwork, of whom I am but one of, can possess their own 
ideas of what it means, of course. Here's mine, feel free to take your own:

Sea, land, sky. The crimson of a fading light, and the bright beginnings of a 
new day. Man(kind), with our vivid red internals, stands astride the border of 
the ocean and the surface. We walk where we will, perhaps into the black depths 
of the cosmos beyond, but forever do we anchor ourselves and owe allegiance to 
our earth and our star. Sunlight casts crimson light upon our externals, as our 
hearts do beat through time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@deilann 

yes, when defining with numbers it's easy because one is one and that's done.

with concepts such as infinity or direction or cardinality, it's more difficult 
because you need more than just a "magnitude from zero" to describe them. Rules 
means more contradictions, which is totally okay! It just means you need more 
than one definition of "infinity" for example, for different contexts.

use a scalpel for surgery or art, when precision is needed, use a pocket-knife 
like a leather~~man~~daddy for tougher tasks like whittling a spear or throwing 
a spear or stabbing fascists with spears - where was I going with this? oh yes:

when thinking of sets, to me infinity is more like... "too many numbers" like, 
the meme with the guy who is having difficulty holding too many limes. They 
overflow and spill out of your set-like-container, no matter how you define the 
boundaries of the set. "does the set of all sets include itself or does it 
overflow" kinda vibe.

 -> file: fediverse/3324.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@deilann 

If I follow correctly, the reason it's not is because you're dividing zero by 
two? meaning the magnitude of infinity would be zero.

... chat, is infinity just... zero, viewed from a different perspective?

 -> file: fediverse/3325.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@deilann 

so... if infinity is the inverse of zero, then when inverted would infinity 
also be zero?

if so, it follows that the [spectrum/dimension/cardinality/direction] that the 
inversion is occurring upon might also have other steps inbetween. Unless it's 
a binary thing, like "top and bottom" or "present and absent".

I wonder what those steps might look like? Clearly, since infinity minus 
infinity does not equal zero, the steps inbetween (if they exist) would not be 
numbers. If they were, then one single step from inverting infinity would be 1, 
but I don't believe that would be true.

On the topic of rings, the axioms would be things like "a ring is a ring if you 
can trace a continuous line with a length of infinity across it's 
ring-like-surface"? I wonder what the inverse of a length is... Or perhaps you 
cannot invert a length, as to do so would give you a length of zero (in this 
particular ring-like-case)

It's interesting to me that we can divide by infinity, but not zero. I feel

publicly of the things that we have noticed. They are much better than we are

then they could be sorted into different sections, sorta like how you can have

bad people are cursed with evil.

a person cannot be evil. they can deal with such evil in their lives that 
twists them, and causes them to spike out and harm others, but they are not 
evil themselves.

some twists are too hard to mend. some healings leave people a shadow of what 
they once were, or might have been. but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try.

deprive power, supply kindness, in that order.

if you cannot deprive power, then reduce harm.

if you cannot reduce harm, then contest, defeat, or overcome.

A twisted person may be slain if death is on the line. You get what you wish 
for, but you don't always get to choose who. Don't let them choose. They will 
choose poorly.

... I find that death is very rarely on the table, though. Generally they'll 
make their intentions apparent.

you should only use variables for things that are user-configurable.

google and their ads created the market for SEO optimized garbage which clogs 
up the arteries of the internet. They and their business model are culpable in 
the murder of the digital commons.

anyone can write a web crawler which could be a decent enough search engine.

not many people can figure out which sites are morass.

fewer still might salt the fecund land upon which we lived and make it fetid. 
Yet they did.

ya'll we have bigger problems than [whatever you're working on right now]

like the problem of deciding which problem to work on.

we should make deciding which problems are problems and how problematic they 
are a priority for our problem solving discussions
