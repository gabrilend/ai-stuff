I made an alias that overwrites cd so I don't have to do this. The important 
line is line 27, you could probably accomplish something similar like this:

alias cd="cd ${1} && ls -v --color=auto"

I also set it up so I can change more than one directory up using ... or .... 
or .....

also I have a few shortcut scripts, cdir and qcd. cdir creates a quick way to 
drop a bookmark wherever I'd like, while qcd can make permanent bookmarks. Also 
qcd makes it so whenever I open a new terminal it opens to the last directory I 
was in, which is nice if you need a new terminal to do something in the current 
folder and you don't want to have to walk alllllllll the way back.

Hello, I am a witch.

There's more than one kind of witch, but I promise that I'm the kind you'd like 
to have around.

There's another kind, however, that is unlike me in kind but I think you'll 
find is just as rare, and just as tempestuous.

I like to think I am good aligned, perhaps not "good" as in "capable" but 
"good" as in "benevolent" and "perhaps" as in "unknowable" and "but" as in 
"desired" and "desired" as in "what I work toward because it's the right thing 
to do" and "work toward" as in "realized according to the effects of my actions 
not just by my intentions"

The other kind of witch is the kind that hurts people.

There are many reasons why you might find yourself in the house of such a 
witch, but all of them are caused by your desire. Take care in the house of a 
witch such as this, and stay no longer than your time allows.

If you find what you're looking for, get out.

If you're almost out of time, get out.

If you lost something, find it, and then get out.

If you run out of time, and things start to "smear", yell out loud your social 
security number. If someone's trying to save you, it'll help them know where to 
put you when you are returned to your body.

I'm sorry to say, but if things start to smear then life will get a little bit 
strange. Just a little. Much better to get out beforehand.

If you find yourself tempted while inside a witch's house, abandon what you 
lost because regaining it comes with a cost.

If you lose sight of your friend, then when you see them again you cannot trust 
that they are who they claim to be, not inside of the witch's house.

If you lose sight of your friend, trust that they will get out by their own 
hand, and find what you want and go home.

Unless, of course, your heart is pure, and your friend is what you want back in 
your life again. Then you will trend toward finding them yet again, so find 
what you want and get out.

They will try to keep you there, through inaction and professed exhilaration, 
but generally they'll do what you command. So take them and get out.

There are many reasons why you might find yourself on the path to a witch's 
house, but none of them are to be repeated. It's more of a life event and less 
of a venture, so take what you want and go forth.

If you find yourself in my house, take a cookie or a brownie, and please do 
come again. The house of a witch such as mine is somewhere you'll probably find 
that love and affection are fonder.

Elentalus unit idea: serrated kitchen knives for teeth, devouring pumpkin, 
misery of the drowned, etc. Halloween style monsters. Witch units have a spell 
that dismisses them, and they're summoned with magic items. Except, if two of 
that item exist in a province, it upgrades itself, random dice style. In doing 
so it gets stronger. The thing is... It summons one for your enemy as well! 
Which is why you want to have a witch unit there to dismiss them. Problem is, 
she can only dismiss them at close range (10ish?) so she'd better be well 
protected. The good news is though that sometimes the higher level items give 
bonuses that are hard for them to get. Downside is, you need to have magic 
paths to create them that witches can't get - so they become something you 
"unlock" through a pretender or random event or even just an investment. Once 
one is created, then any witch can create more. As long as you don't lose your 
final copy... But as the item's upgraded, it allows you to create higher level 
versions (at increased cost, of course)

This only works if gem income scales. Which, coincidentally, is just what 
elentalus is known for.

Essentially, theming empowerment to be research, unlocking a particular 
capability. Or encouraging pretender design to that pattern. Make sure it comes 
at a cost of something else, though...

There's certainly a path laid toward an optimistic collapse. Lucky for us, it

collapse part) by being kind to the people around you and developing 
relationships with people of all different ages. The greater the spread, the 
more flexible you can be.

you don't know what's at stake, or you don't know where to go... But I know the

the neat thing about BASH is that it's the glue that holds all your other code 
together. Write libraries in C and call them with BASH - accomplish broader 
tasks that are easier to co-create. That's why I like it - it's not the most 
important, but it's quite beneficial I think _^

@sjolsen 

I'd agree with that. it's not designed for performance, not really. Mostly 
ubiquity, which is it's strength. As long as something can be compiled to a 
binary, BASH can execute it. That's why it's good, for accomplishing diverse 
tasks that you cannot have the capacity to program yourself. Scientific 
computations or cultural approximations, things that are beyond your intuitive 
understanding as a human on this earth, but which compel and align your 
thinking.

I'm sure someone could create a more intuitive or accessible syntax, but syntax 
isn't the point - the capabilities, what you can do with it, has always defined 
the purpose of programming paradigms. And BASH is (currently) at the forefront 
of it's niche, the "terminal" language that handles "command line" 
applications. Powershell is good, yes... but it's not as good as BASH. Neither 
is Fish or... the one that starts with a z? zfs? something like that. The 
acronyms are hard to keep straight sometimes.

@sjolsen 

Sounds like the tech was misapplied. If you are aware of the different software 
approaches to solving problems, you can assign resources toward solving 
particularly critical or important tasks. That's why engineers who are also 
leaders or directors are sorta treated like, a "triple threat" in musical 
theatre? Someone who can act, dance, and sing. Because as soon as anyone has a 
single flaw, they are vulnerable. Evil only pushes your being toward the things 
that are weak, obviously, why would an opposite seek toward your meek?

idea: BASH script that runs a game of Majesty through an emulator that included 
an API to interface with x11. You could set a game of this fantasy kingdom 
simulator as your background, and it would move the camera to show you 
interesting events. It could build resources as you directed, through double 
clicking an icon on your desktop or whatever. And the wallpaper would zoom to 
the part that seemed important. Just based on like, which heroes you clicked a 
button that was triggered by a program running in a qt wrapper. Or maybe if you 
said "notify me when this project is completed" or whatever, it'd zoom one of

or like, a window that your window manager could window manage as it pleased. 
I'm thinking of like, i3 or dwm where you have "tiles" instead of "windows" you 
drag around. Really saves on screen real estate, but it lowers the ability of 
your screen to show width. Or height, depending on how you set it up, but since 
monitors tend to be wider than height-er (higher?) they (the users) tend to use 
setups that sacrifice width for visual density.

anyway in such a setup the screen is divided into like, 3rds or 4ths, and each 
window takes up part of it. That way you can reference information from 
multiple sources without having to move anything but your eyes. Really helps 
with keeping it all in your head, because eyes are not reading information like

oh sorry I'll "en-longify" that for you:

most monitors have a fixed resolution, somewhere between 720 pixels wide and 
480 pixels high to 2560 by 1440 pixels high/wide.

This is due to both the desire for humans to read left to right (ingrained in 
our minds at a very young age by learning to read) (or right to left, same 
direction) that we develop the desire for wide-screen monitors.

Therefore, the windows of perception that we have unto this digital world are 
constrained (necessarily) to their own individual specifications. Of which, the 
property value "width" is more valued than "height". Because of this, we 
believe that computers are mistakenly re-acclimated - for everything is most 
efficient when it's aligned to the smallest bits of it's design.

On Reddit there's this idea that 9/10 users will never comment, and 9/10

aligned to this ratio of sorts.

I wonder what the proportion is on the fediverse? If it's the same, perhaps 
it's due to our human nature. If it's different, perhaps it's due to the design

that's how you'd do it on Reddit, at least. With the "original post" part in a 
comment. It sorta disconnects the line of connection, but still the data is 
allowed to flow forth. So anyone who views it from a certain perspective (like 
that of those who own the server it is transmitted upon) could see the 
connections formed, and thus create a map of individuals who have interacted 
with certain content on the internet.

which requires highly skilled labor to undertake and utilize

which is affected by the dynamic where:education, especially liberal arts 
education, tends to produce humans who can see through the lies of authority

yet which is disadvantaged because:tech workers are paid salaries that are just 
bonkers in relation to their output ("yeah it'll be done compiling once this 
game of League of Legends finishes") (which isn't exactly unfair because 
programming is taxing on the brain)

however, the game industry has shown that passion is a suitable exchange in 
return for monetary compensation, and thereforepeople who make games tend to be 
more leftist, as they are put in situations that higher paid employees are 
likely to be able to ignore due to their higher social class

which kinda makes sense, because the most progress towards unionization is

People who strive for the truth and most efficient, sensible, and optimized 
method of operation should be the kinds of people making decisions.

It doesn't necessarily imply they're moral or ethical people, but it does mean 
that they'd likely make better decisions when presented with similar 
information, as compared to someone who acted based on what they were told.

Besides, sometimes you need foot soldiers and grunts. People who don't have the 
inclination towards the types of thoughts you have. That's okay, stuff needs to 
get done and when someone knowledgeable is in charge they can direct others who 
don't know/care.

Of course, this only works if the people who ask questions are given power. If 
the people who strive for honesty and clarity in their methods of operation are 
given the tools and capabilities to undertake tasks that align toward a common 
goal, shared by all those in the organization. Unfortunately, when that goal is

Branches cause cache misses which are slow when done on repeat.

Better to structure your code to avoid them, if possible, for example by using 
an array of function pointers instead of switch statements.

unrelated, but once the data is cached from memory, operations like bit 
shifting and arithmetic are essentially free. The slowest part of the process 
is moving data from RAM to cache so that the CPU can use it.

That being said, CPUs and compilers are VERY good at optimizing that type of 
thing these days.

@CreativeCredent 

Sometimes when I feel overwhelmed with all the boilerplate I just start coding 
and making stuff. Doesn't matter if it works, doesn't matter if it says /* 
FIXME */ all over the place, doesn't matter if it includes header files that 
don't exist yet, as long as you're hacking out the mechanics of whatever 
operations you need to perform then you can figure the rest of that stuff out 
later. The creative urge doesn't last forever, which is why projects get 
abandoned, but with discipline you can keep bringing yourself back to fix all 
the /* FIXME */'s and the compiler errors.

@Mendie_Taoma 

I get it.

Anyone with a disability or chronic condition gets it. Anyone who's oppressed 
gets it... I think everyone here gets it. It's hard.

Sometimes the only thing that gets me through the day is the hope, the idea 
that one day the world might be brighter and the people might be kinder. It 
gets better every day, but inching ahead takes a while to travel for miles... 
We need to protect and care for each other. We need to apply ourselves toward 
what we know and are passionate for - an unused degree is a tragedy to me.

I don't know what to say. I read what you said and I wished I could help. I 
want to take the system that hurt you and break it on the floor. I want to 
sweep it all aside and start from scratch, but screaming into the void will 
hardly accomplish that. I dream of true justice, a world where everyone gets 
what they want... But frankly right now I just wish you could hear. I'm sorry. 
Maladies are not solved by the pen nor the sword, which for now is all that I 
have at my disposal.

hypnotized or perhaps possessed by the spirit of mankind or some other such

about but they aren't talking about which is weird because why else would a

they say witches are scary, and yeah they're not wrong

but they also say witches are ugly, and I think they just didn't have kind 
words for trans people back then.

I mean, I'm gorgeous and so are you. I've no warts, nor green skin, but I do 
grow hair in unbecoming places. Like the tip of my chinny-chin-chin, and also 
on top of my toes.

they also say witches are magic, and I guess that's true (I suppose). I mean, I 
wear quite strange clothes, for a man at least. It's quite normal for a she, 
which is what I was meant to be, if only I was just born right.

Alas, oh well, I'll just take a little green pill, and BAM suddenly I've got 
huge boobs. Okay they're not huge, they're pretty normal. But C is larger than 
zero.

they also say that witches write spells, and I sure do love to program. With my 
most familiar cat (who often does sleep in my hat), I find myself yearning for 
nuance.

Meh, it's late at night, I think I'll think not of the plight, and instead just 
will dream of defusals. I don't know~

dear corporations:

your employees are your greatest resource.

with them, you can change the world.
without them, you die.

if you mistreat them, they resent you.
if you abuse them, they leave you.
if they leave you, you die.

if you teach them... they grow.
if you care for them, they care for you.
if they care, you are whole.

if you connect them, and give them the freedom and liberty to accomplish their 
own ends using the resources that "the social construct you are" provides... 
they build for you.

your employees are your greatest resource, cherish them and hold on. Or one day 
they might end you.

this felt relevant. like... who am I to say that the wisdom of the masses is 
good for anything? 

[or just analyze the contents of social media posts. Like, people pretty much 
speak their mind in their echo chambers. It's a quirk of the human psychology 
that we feel alone and by ourselves when we're with family. That's what makes 
it family, the feeling of being one with another. Like... "yeah we're the same, 
we get each other, hey btw look out the windows of our collective home"]

(ummmm yeah so basically people tend to speak their mind when in echo chambers 
and all social media is a succession of increasingly more accurate echo 
chambers that align themselves toward your personality, not ethics and 
morality.)

be something they learned from there. humans.pattern_matching_function_exists =

@jm101 @Strandjunker 

sounds like something we should dedicate valuable resources to solving. After 
all, no structure or entity would want to possess weaknesses (such a 
misapplication of purpose and direction) or other such errors in their design.

Like, I bet we could test that and find out.

and if, for example, we find that we no longer possess the capacity for 
learning...

well, then maybe that's something we should work on.

because learning new things... that's just an application of development 
resources towards broadening our horizons.

do we really need to solve pi to ten bazillion digits? I mean yeah it's cool 
and all but most of the interesting stuff happens around zero.

you can always learn to learn, that's one of the neat things about it. It's 
self-bootstrapping. As long as you have the capacity to apply yourself toward a 
pictured goal, well... then you can learn. And no human or other sentient and 
capable being would lack such an ability, because it's intrinsic to our form.

therefore, learn

I'd ask why of course, and then I'd try and find them a solution that didn't 
involve taking my stuff. They may need it more than me, but I still need it. 
Like... okay picture that feeling you get when in a capitalist society and you 
need dollars to live because they are a genericized and fractalized abstraction 
of all the various individual mazlowe's hierarchy of needs you have. Then, 
think of it like, instead of money being an abstracted form of all of your 
needs, think of your needs... each of them, the ones that matter to you, and 
abstract them into money. Basically say "yeah sure my time and my labor are 
worth dollars, I abstract my needs into money" and then you can kinda see why 
capitalism is harmful. I'd prefer to give them what they need, because society 
provides what I please, but alas I'm always kept wanting. What good is our 
capitalist utopia? what good is our hope? what good comes of us when all of us 
have learned how to cope?

I think we could give a bit more if we weren't hanging from the rope

Escape to where? Perhaps to our own desired future, the "garden of eden" in our 
solarpunk dreams. So, the Labyrinth in the Death Gate Cycle, before all the 
monsters crept in and ruined it for everyone. Like, a projection of heaven onto 
the matter of our future (spiritual beings projecting "up" on the axis of time 
(which, obviously, looks a little like a corkscrew, because it's the earth 
rotating around the sun. It wibbles and it wobbles ever so imperceptibly, but 
if we look out from the equator we see a map of "us" which, of course, runs out 
of imagined futures for it's denizens (as nothing can ever be thought twice)

sometimes I'm thankful for my poor memory, it allows me to lead where I please.

when the trees of valinor burn, light is projected out into the night. strange, 
how these streetlamps, are hovering and fixed in one place. How could a rabbit 
know that a streetlight, anchored as it is in one place, could somehow become a 
radiant pillar of light? How strange, this form of worship, alas.
