Honestly I think the reason there's two political parties is because then our 
fears align against one another, and we can push against something solid.

If we go back to bearing afraid of the dark, then who knows what might crawl 
out of it's dark recesses.

When Order 66 went into effect, suddenly the CIS became the galactic good guys 
- who would you rather win the clone wars, some bastard capitalists or a 
literal sith lord? At least capitalists can be overthrown, sith lords are 
basically vampire wizards with laser swords and trust me that's NOT a good 
combination.

I like when people make fun of me because it gives me a chance to defend 
myself. Simultaneously I don't like when people are mean to me. I like when 
people find me endearing, and point out the ways that I'm different. It gives 
me a chance to say "oh yes this is why I do that" which feels cathartic 
(because it validates my position) but also because it gives me the opportunity 
to improve it (through debate) and it helps the people who learned from me 
because I can improve myself and my only reason for improving myself is if the 
new thing I'm learning is better than the thing I used to do which means the 
people who learn from me are improved and the people who best me 
argumentatively are improving me.

can interpret each other's expressions even though the exact message wasn't

it's trained with specific random data. But in addition, a secondary pass

You're absolutely right. It's easy to think of the internet as this 
encapsulated entity "the world", but really it's "the people whose computers 
are physically connected to your computer using a limited and tangible piece of 
infrastructure comprised of copper wires that are laid between the 
router/switch that connects to your computer... and the internet service 
provider which directs your traffic. Then it probably goes through some cables 
under the ocean or whatever, and eventually after traversing many indeterminate 
passthrough locations eventually arrives at the computing infrastructure that 
comprises the access point that another person (presumably in another country) 
uses to express their thoughts toward you (the person who sent the original 
message) in the hopes that you might one day correspond.

I mean... That's a lot of points of failure. I sure hope that we can sustain 
such connection, in the face of [redacted, whichever circumstances may come in 
the near future]

ourselves eternally by. Let us work together towards a [near] future where we

They could always just pull the hard drive and put it into a new computer

And yet, was the galaxy not safer and more content under the protection of

more cherished peaceful yearnings of hope and abandoned [fear, but pronounced 
as "indiscretion"]?

He, as the ultimate arbiter of justice and fate in this crucial turning point 
of time and reality that he alone could judge and direct, chose the path of 
least resistance.

"That which is right is most often that which is hard." said a wiser man than 
I, for I cannot be compared as a man since I relinquished it in pursuit of

I wrote a little bit of that on my website, but something told me not to. I

didn't post them until now. I'm only posting them now because they're becoming 
increasingly relevant and it's a little embarassing tbh to showcase how much 
I've changed. Please don't take these things out of context."

I wasn't wrong per se, but I was misaligned. I am always re-aligning myself in 
small ways that eventually create (what I believe to be) the best and most

their totality, they see only what they are exposed to. That's not bad, it's

examinations of the author you sent me. I'll do that before I think about the 
post again.

Those 6 tabs I mentioned last night have now become 4, and soon I'll get 
through all of them - reading is a joy to me ^_^

I think that particular dynamic works in our favor ^_^

one of the best things about fascism is how evil it is, because evil has a 
smell.

Dang I'm riled up now, the part of me that exists in the past wants to swing a 
sword and lop off nazi heads.

@deilann @passenger @mybarkingdogs @risottobias 

Good point. What is one person lopping off nazi heads when compared to a person 
writing a book that compels others to view them with disdain? I think we need 
both, but you're right that "the pen is mightier than the sword"

@passenger @mybarkingdogs @deilann @risottobias 

I see... I mean, I've spent enough time around plants and animals to know that 
certain things are instinctual and are passed on through biological 
reproduction. It's not just that, but my other evidence is anecdotal.

But I also know that most behavior is learned, through a combination of 
circumstance, action, and the intentions behind said actions, taken by the 
individual who is incorporating behavior into their psyche. So... While I'm 
sure there's some merit to each part of the "nature/nurture" spectrum I don't 
think it's really relevant on a meta, socio-political scale. You can just 
abstract all of those concepts and mark it as a black box called "humanity" and 
work through whatever socio-political problem, concern, or quandry you're 
working through.

Abstraction is our friend - It hides the details that (while technically may 
have SOME merit) are irrelevant to the larger-scale decisionmaking, and in fact 
can often delude decionmakers into being unethical.

CW: re: PSA: aspublic.org is still active, and still archives + makes 
searchable all public posts, they have no opt-out, nor do they respect the 
"Include public posts in search results" setting



@admin @ShadowJonathan 

I see, it seems you know more than me about this topic. It's true that search 
engines don't index emails, but I was thinking more of a "cybersecurity" 
perspective, as in any "sufficiently motivated" individual or organization 
could access your emails should they so desire. And should they be willing to 
(I'm assuming?) break a few laws.

If it can be done, and if it gives information that could be used for leverage, 
then you can be assured that someone will do it. I personally worry about 
people in power who could be blackmailed because their communications were more 
public than they anticipated. Which speaks to the problem mentioned in this 
post of the search-indexing-opt-out functionality being present but 
circumnavigatable. Avoidable? Able to be bypassed? It's an illusion of security.

If a kid wanted to drink alcohol all they'd have to do is walk into a liquor 
store and grab the first bottle they saw. Then book it. Their feet would carry 
them away faster than your call to 911 to report a shoplift, away to a future 
of sorrow. Should we seek to restrain them? Or should we make a world they do 
not desire to escape?

Trick question, the structure of society cannot prevent non-compliance. It 
should not, for if it shall then it becomes ossified, and thus it cracks and it 
crumbles.

@BathysphereHat 

I'm transfem, but I figure it's the same thing right?

They tell you to get a bigger needle for pulling the hormones out of the vial 
and then switch to a smaller one when injecting, but there's not really any 
point in that. I say get the same kind of needle (the small one) and just take 
a bit of extra time drawing it out. I still use two needles each time, but if I 
use the "least common denominator" then I can have a bit of extra flexibility 
with little downside.

I added a line to my .bashrc that cats out a random one of my notes every time 
I open a terminal.

I keep reading things that I swear I didn't write, but feel right and true to 
me in a way that could only imply that they came fully formed into my eyes 
through the lines on my screen, cast upon the mirror panes of my hard disk 
drive by the pounding of my keyboard as I once upon a time did cast a spell 
upon my future.

It's pretty neat, but it speaks to a shadowed perspective that perhaps is 
neither within nor without.

Side note, I think I've been possessed by a witch. But like... in a consensual 
way. Like "Hey witch, wanna live? You can chill out with me." [ha that's one 
way to look at it]

@jaycie 

Almost as if we're using it for the wrongs things... Computers are quite 
deterministic, and AI as it's been presented to us has given us the opportunity 
to "massage" said determinism to create a subjectively more organic experience 
of computing.

But yeah sure customer service bots and AI generated art are surely the most 
revolutionary and industrious use of this marvel of technology.

EDIT: Here's a better example I think: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBKgPmS5Fyw

Here's an example of a modern incarnation that might be easier to view than the 
older stuff.

His personality is silly, earnest, genuine, expressive, and friendly. Most of 
the comedy of his stories come from interactions with the environment and the 
creative solutions used to accomplish goals and tasks.

I like to view his perspective as 100% valid and reflective of the world he 
inhabits, which essentially grants him (and others around him) reality warping 
powers which I think is more interesting than just dismissing it as a silly 
cartoon. Through that lens each situation he encounters is an exercise in rapid 
creativity and weaponized logic, which is kinda cool to a witch like me.

Billionaires aren't solving childhood food insecurity.

They have the capacity to, with their essentially endless supply of dollars, 
which taste good on rye with a dash of mustard.

But alas, they choose not to.

They CHOOSE to STARVE children. They choose that, by not dedicating their lives 
to solving that particular problem.

"oh but like, there's so many problems in the world, how can-" shut the fuck 
up, spend the dollars, make it happen, and now there's one fewer billionaire 
and one fewer problem in the world. The next one can fix the next problem, 
that's why we keep them around, isn't it?
