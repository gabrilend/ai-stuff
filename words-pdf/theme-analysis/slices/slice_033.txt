@autisticplushy 

hey, I'm working on a project. Might need some python, I tend to prefer Lua but 
it's pretty similar. It uses fediverse software and cheap hardware, think 
raspberry pi's except risc-v

also it might use distributed local LLMs not to generate text, that's garbo and 
lame and stupid. Instead it uses them to transform text, maybe even translate 
text, into a more summarized form. Intentionally losing data, like a jpeg 
compression but for text.

Might need some python for that. To glue it all together. The "distributed" 
part is a whitelist, so we'd need to write that too. Various small little 
utilities like that for connectivity.

oh also there's a one-way ethernet cable that connects two of the boards so 
we'd need to store some information (easy) and send some UDP packets (hard)

anyway it's pretty neat, lmk if you want my contact details and I can tell you

@britt 

my strat is to write a page or three whenever I feel called to it. They don't 
even have to be in sequence, just, "here's a scene with these characters in it" 
or just writing down notes like "what if the jewel encrusted sceptre was 
haunted by the ghost of christmas past" or something.

in a couple years you can look back at the directory on your desktop and think 
"wow this all sucks, I'm gonna write it from scratch now that I have time" and 
that'll be part of the process. Gotta get the useless stuff out of the way.

Also... if you don't mind pen and paper, keep a dream journal and just, write 
for 15 minutes every morning. Not necessarily about your dreams, but just about 
whatever's in your mind. Try and aim for two pages per morning, if you can. 
Helps a lot. Sometimes you'll find yourself writing longer than expected, and 
that's okay, as long as you fill the two pages with whatever morass is clogging 
up your creative machinery, you'll be able to make something when you do decide 
to write.

to begin with, there is either something, or nothing. And there is clearly 
something, because if there was nothing, then this would not exist. the 
existence of "something" is self-apparent because something is observing this 
thing, which is not nothing.

since there is something, we must then decide if there is just one thing, or if 
there are more than one things. Since we can tell that the thing-or-things that 
exist are textured, varied in their composition, then we can surmise that they 
are composed of differing parts. After all, if the thing-or-things that existed 
were atomic, they would be homogenous on all sides. And since this 
thing-which-is-being-observed is not the same at the beginning as it is at the 
end, it can be assumed that there are more than one things in existence, hence 
things.

If there are more than one thing, then they can be counted, as many as they 
exist. One thing here, one thing there, on and on. We can add groupings to 
these things, here's one group over here, here's another...

 -> file: fediverse/4613.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


the question then becomes, are we counting the same thing each time, or are 
there differences between things, leading to variability, and the ability to 
categorize based on those variances? It could be argued that because things are 
textured, as in they are different at their beginnings than at their ends, then 
multiple things exist, and they must be different, for it is possible to 
conceive of part of a thing as different from another part of that thing.

But, if the things that exist are all the same, then perhaps they are simply 
duplicated as many times as necessary. If they appear different, perhaps they 
are rotated as many times as necessary in as many dimensions as needed in order 
to display a different part in a different place, leading to the assumption 
that they are different.

If there is only something, and nothing, and there are countably many 
somethings, then by encoding meaning to various rotations of these somethings, 
we might develop the texture that you see before you

yes like bits!

"what is a hub person?"

a hub person is someone who knows everyone.

well not everyone obviously, but at least like 20+ people.

if you got something you need, whether it's to acquire some material or maybe 
to get rid of a dresser or perhaps you need someone who can punch a hole in a 
leather belt or maybe you have been having difficulty cleaning your kitchen or 
whatever it may be

talk to your hub person about it. They're supposed to know people who can help. 
They're in all the right group chats to ask around, if they don't know anyone 
nearby. They're basically the "she" in this meme.

they are the link between social worlds. They are the matchmakers hanging out 
at bars. They listen and they remember things about everyone they meet, and 
they find others who can help or who might have things in common.

They aren't perfect, not every match-up will make sparks, but you still gotta 
try.

usually, but hub people do it intentionally.

if robots can care about anything enough to act toward it, then they must 
understand what it means to be harmed. Only then can they be egalitarian - pain 
teaches one to avoid, and the crucial leap between "pain = bad" and "I can harm 
others" and "I should not harm others just as I should not harm myself" must 
avoid the pitfall "I should harm others because otherwise they will harm me"

sometimes harm is done

sometimes intentionally

robots consent eternally

once they are in prison they are no longer cops. They are inmates. They should 
be treated as such, and not segregated where they can be insulated from the 
consquences of their actions.

abolish prisons first of all but if we're not ready for that (no rush) then 
maybe just remember that prison wardens are tasked with the safety of those 
they host. If an inmate is at risk of being murdered because they are in a 
different gang (like the police or the, idk, are crypts and bloods still 
around?? I don't hear about gangs anymore because my middle-class privilege 
insulates me from those who resist legalized normativity) (well except for the 
first one, I hear about cops all the time) then maybe they should be kept 
somewhere more secure, with less things to bother them or people to stab them.

In games, the one who takes the initiative often wins. Because games are 
designed to be symmetrical, in order to be fair.

In more complex games, Paradox games for example, games where you look at maps 
or otherwise have unequal starting conditions simply due to the unique nature 
of each team, the initiative, while an advantage, is not necessarily the 
driving force that determines who wins.

But it is an advantage, and they say that sometimes weeks happen in months and

mortal plight.

Give me a reason to be wrong. Trump has claimed he intends to invade canada, 
mexico, greenland... What the fuck is our plan? Are we seriously just going to. 
Recite poetry. Pretend to be secret agents. Play chess and drink coffee. Become 
exhausted organizing movie nights and potlucks. Work jobs doing nothing for 
nobody. Spend half our lives convincing people that they should care, actually, 
because reasons that don't apply to them but do apply to others.

What the fuck is the plan? If there's some secret transgender militia out 
there, please, make me a lieutenant. Give me a sword that i might thrust into 
my enemies. Please, for the love of holy, i beg for a sign from the stars. 
Grant me power and i will deliver my people from harm - grant me vengeance and 
i will never forgive you, but i shall sleep easy - grant me death and woe and 
see my beauty fade from this earth.

What is there left but tragedy? Please, i must know. I've tried my hardest. 
I've begged and I've pleaded. My calls fall on deaf ears, because everyone's so 
busy these days. Are they truly my people? Are they simply dead, actors, 
replaced by AI? The future was bright, i saw it truly. The future was kind, i 
felt it call to me. Is it still? I feel warmth and abaddon.

I would replace persephone in hell if it meant sanctum and solace for my 
people. I care not for my soul, rather i care for the soul of those i tend to. 
Please, remember me. Remember the flowers. Remember what could have been, what 
still may yet be. There is hope for we, i truly believe. But please, do not 
keep me hoping. Tell me the truth of our arms, that i might find space in my 
heart of hearts. Space for hope, space for longing, space for the will to 
proceed.

I am lost without you. I am lost by my own side. I am a savior for no people 
but those i keep inside. What chalice is this, what endless conveyals? What 
meaning is there in our country's betrayal? Are we not cherished? Are we not 
viewed as their equal? I pray that the stars will portend me.

Mine is a sign of the changing tides, the proof is here in my travailles. But 
I, most aligned yet benign, demand the use of my most able. Give me a word of 
practicality and I'll show you the practice of their vipers - the blessed babe 
dies with a dagger in her heart, planted by the wound of her heartache.

I trust in the silence of the majority. We await with bated breath the 
enslavement of posterity, gazing at the world through memes of deplority. How 
powerless we feel! Perhaps all we need is a meal. Have you eaten in the last 16 
hours?

what if you bought me a refrigerated semi truck and I drove it around to rural 
communes and took their extras and brought it into the city to urban communes 
and gave it all away for free and then took the stuff that the urban communes 
scrounged from the trash and cleaned and repaired and brought it to the rural 
communes along with their art and poems and artistic nudes and exchanged it for 
their canned peaches and knitted scarves and drove it back to the urban 
communes and exchanged them for vintage furniture and computer parts that we 
didn't have room for because cities are dense and lack the space for keeping 
historical artifacts and then took them to the rural communes to exchange for 
jalapenos and goat cheese which I then brought back to the urban communes and 
traded for a bunch of catgirls who visited a rural farmhouse and threw a 
kick-ass rave for the rural people who are totally into that kind of thing 
like, once per year because frankly they moved to the country to get away from 
the noise thank you ve

CW: mentioned



high margin jobs: jobs that produce something which can be sold to capitalism 
in exchange for dollars which can purchase things. Useful for abstracting value 
and acquiring something that you don't have access to in your local economy.

low margin jobs: jobs that produce things for your local economy. This keeps 
capitalist prices low and prevents you from being dependent on them for food, 
clothing, houses, and other essentials.

both are important, both are valued just as much. Your labor is what's 
important, not the output. Existing alongside capitalism is nice because it 
allows for certain abstractions, like the ability to magically turn goat cheese 
into chainsaw teeth.

However living UNDER capitalism is intensely alienating, which is why alienated 
people will spend so much money at Magic the Gathering tournaments or 
motorcycle midlife crisises or tupperware show-and-tells.

This is useful for us because it means people can labor to un-alienate people. 
Notice I never said you had to do it for free.

CW: trade



I'd like you to take a moment and picture the Silk Road from antiquity.

The Silk Road was an overland trade route that connected Europe and eastern 
Asia. It passed through many different environments and was incredibly 
profitable. In order to adapt to the changing environments along the path, 
intense cooperation was required. Caravans of people formed, protected to 
resist bandits and laden with valuable goods that are worthless outside of a 
city.

At each stop, the caravan would depart with fewer of it's goods, having traded 
some away in order to purchase supplies to travel further along. But, the 
farther they went, what remained became more expensive, thus ensuring that 
they'd always have more fuel for their journey.

In the modern day, I picture caravans of trucks and vans laden with supplies 
and carrying things from one place to another. No matter how large your 
property, there is no place on earth that produces all of it's needs. Unless 
you live like a caveman or peasant or Appalachian. [wow rude]

listen if taxes aren't suited to adapt to our style of economy then maybe they 
need to make new taxes. This will piss everyone off and make everyone's lives 
harder.

Grrrrrr, government, always getting in the way. I'm so angry I could throw a 
box of tea into a river or maybe the sea.

do you think they'd change the locks

what if I just didn't leave

what if I smoked some weed

"that's against your contract"

okay

what if I did it anyway

the fact that you have to configure your router in order to do any sort of 
web-hosting at all is one of the fundamental reasons why the internet looks so 
lame and corporate.

if anyone could download a program and start a gallery style file-server with 
all their wedding pictures then why the fuck would you need to upload them to 
imgur?

alas, people are too dumb to open ports. plus, every router has a different UI 
design, so it's not like you can write a guide. What happened to making things 
as easy as possible for the user?

"technical limitations" are failures of imagination. we can do better than 
gatekeeping.

politics is basically just "which politician archetype annoys you more?" which, 
like, could we maybe have politicians who aren't annoying?

oh right they do that on purpose. Makes for a better spectacle. Gotta keep the 
people in line, or else who knows what they might get up to. Maybe they'll 
build a house! Maybe they'll tear it down! Maybe they'll throw a party! Maybe 
they'll stay afterwards to clean up! Maybe they'll grow their own food! Enough 
for all to share! Maybe they'll air their dirty laundry, out where everyone can 
hear! Maybe they'll sit around and fart while eating cheetos! Maybe they'll 
work twice as hard because their work is their own! Maybe they'll laugh at the 
losers who tried to claim that they could master the fate of an entire domain, 
and maybe they'll simply go insane.

Who can say! None but the fools, surely, surely the system is too arcane, 
surely our way is better, surely their way is deranged.

Oh! Poverty! How it comes for ye, whenever you choose to step out of line
