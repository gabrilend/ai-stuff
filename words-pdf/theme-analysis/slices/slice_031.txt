how cherished is she
that wanders with the
flowers in the garden of eden

under a big tree
her heart she will leave
with all her designs she abandoned

I lay beside them and wander beside her
will she know we miss her horizons

I think she will mind,
if I have resigned,
my fate to a life I will hide in,

oh how I do long for you.

how cherished is she
that wanders with the
flowers in the garden of eden

under a big tree
her heart she will leave
with all her designs she abandoned

I lay beside them and wander beside her
will she know we miss her horizons

I think she will mind,
if I have resigned,
my fate to a life I will hide in,

oh how I do long for you.

her symbol is the name that lets us belong here,
a falling, a light, and a leaving,

if only our words were listened.
but power is penance, 
and repentance is all that I have chosen.

here in our sanctum we live with our only
and time will be gracious towards us

it's only our words that keep us
confined to our lights and our lonely

yet there and beyond, her lights do belong,
beyold in the land that is sanctum

here and before us is our own dark forest
where we keep our silence to ward us

but there and beyond, her heart does move on,
free from her moments of longing,
silent were we, in our forest we plead,
as terror has come for our moments

I think I will find her, that cherished belonging
when she does at last come to warn us,

how little we find, of thoughts from her mind,
yet now we are kings of our own time.

oh how she does long for you.

how cherished is she
that wanders with the
flowers in the garden of eden

under a big tree
her heart she will leave
with all her designs she abandoned

I lay beside them and wander beside her
will she know we miss her horizons

I think she will mind,
if I have resigned,
my fate to a life I will hide in,

oh how I do long for you.

this election is a measurement of fear

red states fear disorder and terror more than anything else

blue states fear restriction and un-self directed personal development

both perspectives are valid, and don't have to cross one another. But each 
couple years, we're forced to contest each other.

someone should make an app that was basically a massive tree structure that 
started small and expanded in growth

at each node [computer programming term] it would ask a moral or philosophical 
question, and depending on the user's answer it would map out their preferences 
for politics.

using the power of technology, we might revolutionize the way we vote. In doing 
so, we could each have our own shared understanding, and we would keep each 
other from harm's way.

when war comes to a land, it destroys all who live within. Everyone everywhere 
will be spending their lives picking up the ashes.

instead, we might decide that having a deeper understanding of what we share is 
more valuable than winning a contest of wills.

against a friend. to train, and improve, and stay in shape. like, sparring in a 
martial art, or playing a game of chess with your heart.

[basically she's saying that we could create a "permanent vote" that is able to 
be tweaked at any time.

the elections are still taking place every 4 years, which is when all the 
changes we've drifted toward will begin to take effect.

"oh boy I can't wait 6 more months for the next election when *abortion is made 
legal again*"

"gosh it sure is nice to have a small period between deciding something should 
be done and having it come into effect."

sure would give us a lot more time to discuss and engage with each other on 
important topics. Like gender reveal parties and their excessive [wait hang on, 
think about the important parts.] ugh right okay like *transsexual marriage* 
and "anti-ugliness trackers where people compare flaws all day and try to be 
the best [you're just talking about social media] oh um, yeah, was there a 
different type of service like that?

oh, right, you don't know about grindr yet. okay so there's this website where 
people would go on to have sex, it was like an app on your phone and you could 
just open it up and update your preferences whenever you wanted. They had this 
neat tool you could use to "suss it out" with swiping and choosing you could 
pick your own spouse.

but ah, alas, what about all the other people who aren't using the app? eh who 
cares they'll find love eventually, this is more *fun* than dating people you 
deeply know.

[sorry dipped out there for a moment - what's this about dating applications?]

a picture of the electoral college results [so far]

there are large swathes of the country that are red, and tiny pockets sprinkled 
roughly equidistantly all over that are blue.

pnw is surrounded and split

california and nevada is too focused inward

NE is just going to become little canada

meanwhile the states south-east of colorado and north-east of california are 
going to be the birthplaces of the new confederacy

fucking bastards

colorado defends from the mountains

the military faces theft of equipment which is used en-masse to disrupt combat 
convoys while command struggles to hold everything clear

the south and east (Austin) fall under siege

aviation experts fly bomb-laden civilian aircraft into convoys

drones and landmined highways abound

volunteers from canada turned away at the border

except in vancouver

portland unites with seattle

montana is an unexpected ally

pseudo-confederate trump followers break and run in the north-east

moments of calm as the right sizes up their foes while democrats march on

cities expand, more people can cover more land

blitzkrieg doesn't do shit if your car is broken or the roads are deformed.

... well, I mean most of middle america can just be driven over. Like, no road 
for the next few miles? whatever, I got a truck because I live by the roadside

direct action is not just methods of fulfilling our needs

it's about practicing the skills necessary to get things done

the homeless can't feed themselves if there's no war afoot. but learning how to 
work with an organization to accomplish a real, tangible goal... that's the 
beauty of it.

you do pushups, right? you practice your singing voice, and brush your hair out 
at night. You clean up your carpets, you take care of a home, all these are 
skills and routines that you practice, to practice doing little things 
bit-by-bit.

It's okay if it feels untenable. Just work as best as you can. Tomorrow might 
feel like unending, but there's always more for us to tend.

until, of course, it gets easier. And it will, in due course. Sooner if we all 
cooperated, but still just enough for us to contend.

there are more of us than them. We don't all need to fight, we just need to 
support and to tend.

Trust me. We're alright. It's going to get better before it's done.

@wyatt8740 

best case scenario, we elect a lawyer working for capitalism, the kind of 
society we live under.

having money is the same as having resources. And resources allow you to apply 
yourself to a goal. The more you have, the better, but they each bear a heavy 
load.

Do you sacrifice your labor? your dignity, your honor? what do you burn on the 
fire of wasteful expenditures, just for the power to rent?

I'm saying that if you don't have money, you need to think about what you can 
do with what you got, because that's how you pay for things, at least until we 
decide that we'd rather help each other than work on capital's games.

you have a house though, right? a place to live until it gets hot? that's good 
enough for right now. Stay where you're at, do what you can to help. Get in the 
habit of it. Think about how someone will complete their task, and then think 
about stuff two or three steps down the road - what tools will they need? what 
are they working on next? Can make any of those availble?

attention, they will falter unless they create a grand battleplan. And plans 
are defeated by rapid flexibility.

The more effort they need to counter you, the more work your allies can get 
done. Every man woman and child who raised a fist will be remembered by the

I know it's terrible right now, but we have crucial advantages that we 
shouldn't sleep on.

We have the cities, and the cities are where everything is. Rural areas are so 
spread apart they pretty much can only do what herr Hitler suggests they do, 
meaning their command structure is monolithic. If everywhere needs their 
attention, they will falter unless they create a grand battleplan. And plans 
are defeated by rapid flexibility.

The more effort they need to counter you, the more work your allies can get 
done. Every man woman and child who raised a fist will be remembered by the 
moments that gave us grace to move socialism along. We know what time it is, do 
you? Come to us now, flee from your new masters. We'll give you a job that'll 
help us go faster.

Or do you rather persist in vain? To fight for what they are forced to reclaim?

In Philly during BLM people left pallets of bricks all over, to incite a riot.

sufficient. Remember how I spoke my heart to the cops this summer? It converts

I live in the Pacific Northwest.

Tactically, nothing has changed - we must still work to secure food, housing, 
employment, HRT, and all the other materials necessary for life.

Strategically, we're suddenly in a whole new game.

In the Pacific Northwest, the first goal should be to unite Portland and 
Seattle. Right between them lies the capital of the Proud Boys in a town called 
Battleground. How fitting.

To the south, below Portland, there is Salem. Salem is red, but cities trend 
blue, so there might be allies there.

Below Salem is Eugene. Eugene is blue. Salem must be secured.

Part one: control battleground

part two: control Salem

Part Three, and the ultimate goal of phase one: deprive the far right of a 
pacific port

strategically, preventing them from utilizing the pacific ocean will be SO much 
more productive than anything else we could be doing in this area.

I need an editor. Someone who can re-arrange what I say and present it to an

still need swords.

I believe in democracy. I believe in the will of the people and the respect of 
the land. I believe in life, light, and liberty for all.

Our nation has just elected, fairly, a dictator who will sell our country to 
foreign authoritarians just because he is small. I am stronger by far, but I 
lack his experience, and so I must rely on trusted advisors who grow with me.

I am perhaps not the best choice, but I do believe I am one of the bravest. 
Judge me as you will.

Trump will destroy the American experiment and invite fascism into our home. We

My demands are threefold.

First, I demand that Trump be replaced by a moderate republican. Hold a primary 
and let Democrats vote. If none of your candidates work for us, pick a new 
roster and try again.

The second is that Trump must be executed for treasonous high crimes. Nothing 
less than execution will suffice.

Next, let the supreme court be purged and replaced. Half with democrats, half 
republicans, and one moderate who is widely regarded with respect.

Failing these demands, I am willing to wage a terrible civil war for the soul 
of our country. I know this is treason, but I do it anyway even though I am a 
patriot. I do it because our land has been stolen by a man and his followers 
who seek to plunge my people into despair.

Each of the wars we fight will be smaller than the last, as each of our cities 
struggles toward our last gasp.

But together we are strong, and by connecting them we might deliver ourselves 
from harm.

Against the far right, we must secure a cleansing blow. There is no greater 
fight. The world is watching.

To that end, I suggest a great and perilous fight. I see no other option in 
this remarkable century. Prepare as you might, I suggest pushups and resource 
acquisition. 

Deliver your resources somewhere safe if you're in a red area, and meet your 
neighbors if you're not.

A blue city in a red state must survive a siege. Prepare yourself for this. 
Assume that supplies will need to be delivered by convoy if by land, and drone

I need an editor. Someone who can re-arrange what I say and present it to an 
audience. The pen is mightier than the sword, and while my pen is mighty, you 
still need swords.

I believe in democracy. I believe in the will of the people and the respect of 
the land. I believe in life, light, and liberty for all.

Our nation has just elected, fairly, a dictator who will sell our country to 
foreign authoritarians just because he is small. I am stronger by far, but I 
lack his experience, and so I must rely on trusted advisors who grow with me.

I am perhaps not the best choice, but I do believe I am one of the bravest. 
Judge me as you will.

Trump will destroy the American experiment and invite fascism into our home. We 
have people to nurture and protect, and authoritarianism prevents us from doing 
so.

He would deprive us of our light, and frankly he already has.

He would deprive us of our liberty, and his plans to do so are clear and 
apparent.

He would deprive us of our lives, and history has shown that this is a 
precedent.

I do not consent to a Trump presidency. I do not consent to his corruption any 
longer. No more will I or my people be governed by such evil. We will fight 
back, of this I am certain.

My demands are threefold.

First, I demand that Trump be replaced by a moderate republican. Hold a primary 
and let Democrats vote. If none of your candidates work for us, pick a new 
roster and try again.

The second is that Trump must be executed for treasonous high crimes. Nothing 
less than execution will suffice.

Next, let the supreme court be purged and replaced. Half with democrats, half 
republicans, and one moderate who is widely regarded with respect.

Failing these demands, I am willing to wage a terrible civil war for the soul 
of our country. I know this is treason, but I do it anyway even though I am a 
patriot. I do it because our land has been stolen by a man and his followers 
who seek to plunge my people into despair.

He is but one man. So am I.

He has an army of followers. I do not.

Each of the wars we fight will be smaller than the last, as each of our cities 
struggles toward our last gasp.

But together we are strong, and by connecting them we might deliver ourselves 
from harm.

Against the far right, we must secure a cleansing blow. There is no greater 
fight. The world is watching.

To that end, I suggest a great and perilous fight. I see no other option in 
this remarkable century. Prepare as you might, I suggest pushups and resource 
acquisition. 

Deliver your resources somewhere safe if you're in a red area, and meet your 
neighbors if you're not.

A blue city in a red state must survive a siege. Prepare yourself for this. 
Assume that supplies will need to be delivered by convoy if by land, and drone 
airdrop from the skies. Develop ways to protect these supply methods.

Public spaces are our homes now, our houses are just where we sleep.

I swear this to you: on my life I will be honorable and fair. I will seek true 
justice when I can, where everyone gets what they want, and failing that I will 
be plainly just. I will respect all peoples, and do my best to fight for a 
brighter tomorrow.

I dare for the bright age. I see nothing else that I'd like to spend my life 
doing than daring.

The bigger a county is on the electoral map, the weaker it is. But, the more 
space required to control it completely. Treat the largest counties like 
Badlands - difficult to traverse unless in numbers, and even with numbers 
you're a bright shining target. Very little food, very few supplies, often not 
worth controlling aside from the peace and knowledge that your foes will not 
attack from that direction.

they are not MAGA anymore. Don't call them Trumpers. He won't last long.

Call them what they are. They are part of a newly born Confederacy, and we must 
call them by their name. That name demands respect, and we must respect their 
power.

Then, when you're sufficiently cautious, begin conjuring visions of their 
downfall. Ideally accompanied by carefully laid plans intended to accomplish 
specific strategic goals.

They are top-heavy. Once their bravest and thickest perish they will have 
nothing left but their weak fools. They are scared, nothing unites them more 
than fear, and for that they are weakened.

Our bonds are those of love. I would die for my neighbor. I would die for our 
world. They have no passion, no rigor, all they have is hate and vigor.

Martial skills we can learn. We will have to, sooner rather than later. Be 
prepared, work hard, and do what you're good at, ideally what you'd like to do.

@mrjunge @smitten 

expand national parks

build carbon scrapers out of moss, wood, and automated water misters

use heat pumps, rocket mass heaters, and subsurface airflow cooling in new 
constructions. Try to convert older buildings when possible.

maintain trading routes to China and other places that produce solar panels.

cut down on plastic waste by switching to glass and metal containers for food. 
Develop infrastructure to clean and sanitize cans and bottles at grocery 
stores, and refill food containers to be resold there.

Remember that plastic is a wonder material that can do so many things. We can 
use it, but keep it in check.

I think electric vehicles are a mid-term goal. For now, gasoline is more 
flexible, unfortunately. In the near future that reality will change, so look 
toward tomorrow and rejoice.

Our infrastructure is car based. We cannot change that in the near term.

Above all else, keep our national parks pristine. They are our heritage to our 
children, and they are temples to our nature.

I like Void Linux because it's simple, clean, and gets out of your way. It was 
my first Linux distribution and I think it's excellent for a beginner.

I use Gentoo because my old best friend installed it on a thinkpad she gifted 
me. Then I kept it because I liked the idea of compiling all my software 
locally and being as flexible as possible.

I installed NixOS on my newest laptop because I thought it'd be nice to have a 
system that was dependable. NixOS has all the system configuration done in a 
single file, so if you save that file you can rebuild your system on any other 
system with minimal effort (at least, that's the idea - I haven't tested it yet)

I went to a trans meetup a couple days ago. It was invigorating. The first half 
we talked about hormones and bathrooms and politics and all the normal shit 
these meetups tend to do. I don't tend to go to them because it's the same 
stuff every time, and I'm over that. I've been out for a decade. I've shared 
what I need to share.

Partway through I said "If you want to talk about how to bash back, meet me 
outside."

people came.

Be like me.

You will forever vanquish your demons if you face them in earnest. I had 
stagefright and adrenaline but I took the lead, and we had a productive 
conversation. We need to have many more conversations.

We have strategy. It is not set in stone, it is flexible, and able to be 
adjusted based on tactical successes and failures.

tactics are what we need to discuss at in-person meetings.

You are just one person. The people you know are more valuable than the value 
you personally provide.

to be "rich" is to have more than another.

if you are happy, they are happiness poor.
if you have community, they are alone.
if you have serenity, they are chaotic.

I am rich in very little but fire in my soul.

I have enough in most cases, but I still struggle to pay rent.

I am warmed by the pearl my swirling darkness has coalesced into. It nourishes
