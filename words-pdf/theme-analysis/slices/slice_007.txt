Protests are great because they give you the opportunity to make friends with 
2-5 other people who you've never met before, and who've never met each other.

People who you could play DND with - for those who don't know, DND is a fun 
activity you can do with friends that involves chips, soda, sometimes beer, and 
plenty of laughter and loud voices.

It's essentially a game where a group of people create plans, solve problems, 
and organize solutions to roadblocks on their path to success.

It's also great because it's a planned activity that you don't have to take 
your phone to - in fact, it's best when you don't make a reminder for for the 
event anywhere digital or easily misplaced.

There aren't too many rules, and whatever you can't remember you can make up on 
the fly. It's not like there's any consequences in a game, not like anyone 
could die.

Most people don't like playing games with me though because I have a pretty bad 
memory. Call it a quirk of fate or something

quintessential friend group:

the smart one

the cute one

the one who can swing a bat

the one who has a list of all the Nazis in the area because they hacked their 
email account and know who purchased nazi memorabilia

the friendly one who's always down to hang out

the outdoorsy one

the fed

the one who's always cooking something

the one who's perfectly fine in silence

the one who never lets a room go silent (unless everyone else wants to just 
chill of course - hey anyone wanna go on a walk? it's a great day)

the one who's good with animals

the one who's smile you can't get out of your head

the one who's drop-dead gorgeous

and the one who's always telling her that

the one who's friends with everyone,

and the one who's knitting a hat

the one who knows each street in your city

and the one who knows your favorite kind of candy

There's more friends than that, of which I am quite sure

Who's on your list? Who would find you if you disappeared?

An app that listed all the tasks that needed to be done in a city and people 
could just do whichever they wanted. Like "water this planter box of carrots"

Specialists who knew the requirements of plants could set up tasks and

Grocery stores should be central repositories of food that anyone can take 
anything from. In addition, apartment buildings and complexes and the entrances 
to suburban subdivisions could have stalls that food is delivered to, from the 
grocery stores. If you want to help out you could carry food from store->stall. 
The stalls would have what the residences they served listed as things they 
wanted stocked, like an external pantry that was shared by the community.

You could also place orders a day in advance and it would be provided for by 
the local grocery. If you wanted an exotic good it might have a larger lead

If you don't get to all of them (because let's face it, who's gonna eat all

this situation is pretty common in rural areas where people have large harvests 
of single crops all at once, or in a very short timeframe. However in those

I guess so. I tried to respond in kind to your original post. I'm not an

spent on Wikipedia might be what you're looking for.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics

alternatively you could read some anarchist / anti-capitalist literature, like 
Kropotkin or Marx. Though I admit they're a bit dated.

You could also check out this website, there's plenty of academic works here, 
if you'd like to sharpen your understanding of what their "plan" is aside from 
bartering for shit and trading beeswax for lamp oil.

https://theanarchistlibrary.org/special/index

though frankly throwing a book list at a person is not really very kind, so if 
you'd prefer to talk to someone who's into leftism I'm open for discussion. 
Though as I mentioned I probably won't be able to provide a better academic 
perspective than what you'll find elsewhere.

@tsukkitsune @adhdeanasl 

perhaps not a while, but rather "with great difficulty"

difficult things often take time, but not necessarily. We have the power of the 
internet now, something that our hundred thousand years or more of starvation 
lacked. we can coordinate on a scale that is beyond all reason - a scale that 
mirrors the development of the printing press in terms of it's relative 
magnitude.

we have been using it to improve ourselves. I mean, the average teenager 50 
years ago would be considered an absolute ding-wad today, someone who lacks 
basic emotional intelligence and is completely at odds with what we value as a 
cohesive and heartfelt society. And yet they were better than those who came 
before them. Thus does posterity march forth, taking the world that was granted 
to them by their forefathers and stepping out into the unknown of the future 
with all the lessons they could bring with them.

what happens when the lessons are infinitely transferable and recordable?

@deilann 

is this... undefined behavior? or does it evaluate to 5 every time it's called?

I find that often my art makes me feel intense emotions, not all of them good. 
But sharing those emotions with others is a tricky task (so I've recently 
learned) because you can easily overload people with negative feelings - just 
because you're feeling bad, doesn't mean you need to make others feel bad. 
Perhaps they were already feeling bad, and if you intensely and sharply poke 
them with your intense emotions while they're in a vulnerable or safe 
state/place... you can hurt them, more than you intended by expressing your 
feelings.

There are two types of people with power, but it's impossible to tell which is 
which because anyone that gravitic must necessarily hide their true colors.

The first just wants to hurt people. You cannot reason with them, they want 
power for powers sake and they are corrupted by it.

The other is a kind of benevolent fascist, who doesn't want the nuclear 
football in the hands of the people because obviously they'd hurt themselves 
with it.

The second kind can be reasoned with. Of course people exist on a spectrum, but 
these are two extremes that they may be defined by. The second kind can bs 
reasoned with. If you can show them how, structurally and immutably, the power 
they are to relinquish shall not harm this earth, then they shall grant it to 
you. Because at their core they are a kind grandpa herding cats with laser

growing up, my mom would chastise me for doing "the bare minimum" when 
completing tasks.

yes, mom, I fulfilled the requirements of the task. I have a lot of other 
things to attend to, like remembering how to tie my shoes and measuring things 
using a ruler. why would I waste effort that wasn't necessary?

when I grew up, I had a mentor, who told me to "never half ass things, because 
then someone like me will have to do it again."

and that makes sense to me because context switching requires effort and it 
doesn't make sense to leave something half-finished because then there's wasted 
effort spent on things that don't matter. All of the tasks have to get done, so 
why bother doing them in a mixed up order?

it'll translate for you. As long as the end result is functionally the same, 
which could be verified by running two separate VMs that ran interpreters every

then it becomes a game of finding out "why they're interesting"

which is sorta like cryptography I guess? de-cryptology?

could be ordered like a podcast, like "look at what's special about this 
number, it corresponds to these mathematical operations that we both are 
executing, one after another... like hiding information in numbers.

"okay you got 3 arbitrary axises, make one width one height and one depth of a 
box. then, every time you get a number, multiply every odd number spoken on the 
audio by 2 and divide every third number (per 10's digit, like 13 but not 16, 
also 13 but not 9) by 2.

then, every 3rd number (like 9 but not 13) is the depth of the box, every 2nd 
number (like 4 but not 9 and 8) is the height of the box, every 1th number 
(like 1 but not like 1) is the width of the box.

that box translates into a secret set of instructions that only the owner of 
the private key can know. things that were memorized, or written into stone. 
like knowing a secret language made just for you two

CW: wonder-what-would-happen-if



I wonder what would happen if apartment buildings accepted any applicants, but 
only if they applied on a certain day. and first come first serve, of course.

would make it so large groups of people could decide to move to different 
places together. like, herds of roving buffalo

er... I mean like people who shared common interests and want to live near each 
other. like, board games or whatever.

also could do like, decisions toward how they want to organize each other. like 
mini societies that all live in a single ordered society.

(could have as many layers as you want, it's just like making an incredibly 
complicated computer program, except instead of moving data around you're 
moving the direction of your own life. then it'd be able to calculate a 
particular "checksum" that you could broadcast out onto the internet. and 
anyone who was listening could check and compare against their secret key that 
they kept when last you met, updated each time they see me. like, a common 
language.

I feel like I'd learn from coding tutorials more if someone started with a 
complete program they can fit on one panel of their screen, a second for 
showing what each particular thing they're pointing at means, and a third for a 
typical usecase they might build and dismantle on the fly.

like, scientific toys that they could use to explain a particular phenomena. 
the way people used to have 3d models they either bought or built themselves of 
like, atoms and wind patterns and stuff they could explain to kids.

you know, like exactly the kind of things that are commonly stored at 
children's museums.

I was homeschooled, so I went to those places quite a lot. I always felt a 
little unwelcome because I always seemed to be the eldest in every bunch. 
That's continued all throughout my adulthood, like each of my peers are just a 
few years younger than me. I think I just mature more slowly, and thus 
associate with below the average.

it's like, a descriptor of your rate of defining reality and being guided by 
it. when

growing up, children's museums were my third place. like a civic participation 
place where I met others of my peers. but alas, I didn't make any friends. I 
guess I was just kind of strange. Also, I was always travelling, visiting all 
the different cool places. My favorite was in Albuquerque, or maybe that was 
just the most common because I had family there.

why do we treat children's museums like art museums? They should be like 
playgrounds, not like a

It's important to visit as many as possible, because they each have their own 
story to tell. like a part of the geography, or a shared collective regional 
story, they highlight and illuminate different aspects of life. in this way 
each child could be educated according to the shared cultural

but, like travelling herds of buffalo, they can visit different places and 
learn different things. essentially, instead of drilling someone incessantly, 
you're allowed to work thro

when two people undertake a task together (like growing up, or solving a 
problem) they'll naturally learn together. Not necessarily the same things, but 
they'll be around one another and can advise as things became more difficult.

sorta like a morning standup, where you each discuss what you've been working 
on. other people can guide you, but only if you're stuck. if you solve 
everyone's problems, then you probably should be transferred somewhere with 
harder problems.

"ah, but what if there are no harder problems" well then you're not applying 
yourself correctly. Not if you want to grow..."

I can't remember any of my pinky swears. Like, not a single one. I feel like I 
could get in trouble if I renounced errr, instead made human mistakes and

reality is a form of eternal computation, a continuous re-updating of stored 
matter (data). also, values of fields, (like rules and regulations), would 
determine the structural complexity and organizational expectencencies.

preserve limited information that slowly degrades. how slowly is up to you...

I've read about half of "No Shortcuts: Organizing for Power in the New Gilded 
Age" and it seemed useful. Maybe you'll find it useful, it explains a lot of 
the challenges that other unions faced and has ideas for how tech in particular 
might organize.

But I haven't applied anything in there or used it for praxis so YMMV

Remember, kids: User data isn't an asset; it's a toxic industrial byproduct! 
(And should be regulated as such, including jail time for CEOs who allow it 
under their watch.)

unless you create it yourself, store it locally, encrypted if you care about 
safety, and stored for the purposes of creating graphs and generating 
introspective understandings about yourself and your interactions with others.

then, 5 years later you come across an encrypted file that you've lost the key 
to (or have you?) that's like, 3gb and you're like "do I really need a 3gb log 
file, surely it's not the last remaining pictures of my niece or like a recipe 
for my grandma's baked pudding" and before you know it you're carrying your 
entire life's work on your shoulders but you don't even know what any of it 
means.

listen judges are not meant for organizing society, they're supposed to be a 
focused and crucial tool or implement for a society's functioning (like, a 
scalpel to a surgeon or a paring knife to a chef)

they're supposed to decide between two options - abstracted in our realm to 
"guilty" and "not guilty", and apply the ethical and moral principles they hold 
themselves to. Which is why it's so important for them to be impartial arbiters.

We use them to define the fate of a man, but fundamentally their utility is in 
the application of their personal morality.

The best ones have morals that guide them to seek to express the ethics of 
society. Not necessarily because they believe in them, but because it's right 
to use power in such a way. {Power is penance...}

we gotta work with what we got. If a task needs doing, then the tools at our 
disposal will be applied to it - if every hammer looks like a nail, then
