there is a time for solutions, and a time for just getting people on your side.

there is a time for building passions, and a time for letting things slide.

when you think and act cooperatively, by assigning yourself to a comrade cohort,

you can work as a team might, except where everyone wants to do work.

I love what I read here. I think you're all so neat. I love when you talk about 
things, it feels like we're finally finding our feet.

Did any witches out there notice a phase change recently? It's funny when that

@risottobias @strypey 

human brains tend to start ignoring signals when they become normalized. Like, 
if you are consistently exposed to the same smell you get used to it, and you 
stop smelling it. same for noises, and other signals.

it's the same with information, I think, which is why doomscrolling is so bad 
for our brains - we go numb and desensitized! It's not good to have all that 
bad news all the time.

I bet people believe in the "just world hypothesis" for the same reason. 
Essentially, optimizing for equilibrium in all things.

I personally believe true justice is when everyone gets what they want. And if 
someone wants that the other person doesn't get what they want, then they don't 
want true justice. Like, for example, hateful people can never be justified 
because they want another's life to be worse. or they want someone to be wrong, 
which creates a contradiction - you can't give both people what they want if 
one person wants the other to lose.

@deilann 

one thing you can rely on about evil: it presents itself as such.

"you can always rely on bad people to turn mean."

(nobody's beyond forgiveness, but we also need to protect ourselves.)

in video games, going with a defensive build is a valid strategy depending on 
how it's values align. If attacking scales better than defending, in terms of 
"effectiveness at the most difficult part" (usually the last 90% takes 10% of 
the effort) then it's a better strategy. But if your win condition is to 
outlast your opponent, then all you need to do is time your aggression for when 
they begin fracturing.

"I'm sure you don't know this, but once garth fought a dragon. they crashed
through the skies and littered the fields of their home with the broken and
crashed symbols of their own. garth defeated the dragon when one of it's claws

there's this really fun video game I like to play called "Legion TD  2" - it's 
based on a Warcraft3 mod.

In this game, you make tactical and strategic decisions on a fixed term - a 
competitive game between 4 or 8 players with an incredible array of randomness.

it teaches you to work with what you got, and to make decisions based on your 
opponent's weaknesses. Good luck figuring out what they are, though, as you 
can't just memorize them out of a book. You need to adapt, in the moment, to 
the decisions of your foes, while primarily focusing your attention on 
accomplishing a different task.

I really like it because it's taught me to be strategic in plenty of other 
ways. I used to love the game Overwatch because it required adaptibility. The 
game was always changing, so no strategy stuck forever, but every match you'd 
play against a slightly different opponent.

but then Blizzard changed the game because they wanted to make more money, and 
it got worse and worse at what I liked about it. Sadface. : (

@stephstephking 

you have to go back a couple thousand years before it started feeling a bit 
better. sometime between "survival of the fittest" and "private ownership" was 
a pretty neat utopia.

however, I wouldn't trade our world for that one. Not for all the human 
vitality, all the natural effulgence, all the dignity and wonder, none of it is 
worth it. We live in a blessed era, and while it feels bad, like you said it 
just feels bad.

We are being inoculated against despair, for when it comes in force to our 
homes (as it has in so many other places of the world) we must be prepared.

The point of preparation isn't to set up a stable base upon which you can stand 
and address things, though that's always a perk. The point is to practice 
making friends, practice designing systems, practice your skills and practice 
your hope. If you can master those, if you can do them the way an actor might 
do improv, then you'll be able to adapt more easily to whatever may come.

We're in a very good spot I think.

here's an idea - when typing a command in a BASH terminal if you push up it 
inserts the previous command (as expected) but if you hold SHIFT and push up it 
inserts the first argument in your previous command. Then, you can push up 
again (while still holding shift) to go one command further back, and again to 
get the third previous command.

Then, here's the cool part, if you are holding shift and you push left/right, 
then it moves from the first argument of the previous command to the second, 
third, fourth argument.

example:ls -ltr ~/pictures/my-art/

feh [shift+up inserts -ltr]
feh -ltr [hmmm that's not right]
feh -ltr [shift+right switches to 2nd argument]
feh ~/pictures/my-art/ [ah that's better]


would be even cooler if it highlighted it in your previous terminal output so 
you could visually connect your current input with the previous input

it doesn't really matter how you do it, but the more time you spend thinking 
collectively the better you'll be able to adapt when necessary.

I grew up on a homestead in a small town without many friends. I was 
homeschooled, and while I might see another person I knew once or twice a

Besides my family, of course.

We were a collective, and ever since leaving I have yearned for that feeling of

There's something about modern society that pushes us apart, and I resent it. 
Humans were meant for tribes, not multilevel marketing.

I want to clarify two things in this song I wrote a while ago - when I say 
"life isn't meant, to be enjoyed, so... what's the point in trying at all? - 
Well, what's the point in giving up?" I was trying to say "hedonism isn't the 
point of life" but I realize now upon listening to it for the first time since 
writing it [liar lmao] that what it could be interpreted as is "everything 
sucks and it will always suck, so face the future with tenacity" or whatever. 
And that's like, not wrong, but also it's not the whole point, which is that we 
shouldn't strive for contentment unless we're healing.

also I say "never trust a guru" but I'd like to expand that to "never trust 
your heroes" because they'll always disappoint you. But what is a hero if not 
hope given form? Trust in the hope, not the person holding it at that moment. 
You never know, maybe they'll get blown up by an artillery shell or maybe 
they'll betray you or maybe they'll get bored or distracted or whatever. Never 
trust your heroes, trust the inspiration.

I knew I was trans from a young age. I felt attracted to women's clothes 
because I lived in a home with two sisters and a mother - my father was 
frequently away on business.

I guess I liked their clothes more. Or maybe I just wanted to fit in. But I 
found myself stealing them and wearing them when I was alone. Then I got older, 
and amongst all the other things I realized I wanted to be one of them.

I knew what trans people were, sorta, but as soon as I moved to the city and 
got access to the internet the first thing I ever googled was "I want to be a 
girl" - really dating myself here I guess.

@aral @nullagent 

when you leave, he might do the same thing to the next person. Unless you think 
it's additionally a hate crime? or perhaps he has a personal vendetta against 
you. Either way that sounds like an unsafe environment that you didn't consent 
to when moving in. You should at least have the capability to escape that 
situation and place yourself in a more desirable home, if not the capability to 
pursue either remediation or punishment for the crime of harming you.

depends entirely on how the justice of the justice system works out.

temporarily weaken, as now you know how to operate at peak form and should only 
require rest and recuperation (possibly resources) in order to build yourself 
back up to your full potential after being weakened by the trials in your 
recent past.

also, just because getting stronger is part of surviving, doesn't mean that all 
situations where you get stronger are situations where you survive. something 
something the planes who came back had holes in all the un-necessary places

Anger is quite a powerful and useful emotion. Sometimes you can utilize it 
toward achieving your goals, while other times it's simply sufficient to embody 
and feel it.

When I seek to embody anger I listen to Green Day because it lights a fire in 
me that warms my internals ^_^

AGI is the holy grail for the tech industry.

You wouldn't fault a knight for questing! But the peasant or the merchant is 
hardly likely to drink from such a goblet, it is reserved for the hand of 
kings. Alas, that we couldn't find "holy thimbles" that could be distributed 
throughout the populace for the same effect at a decentralized scale, thus 
empowering the masses to transcend their mortality.

Or better yet, task those knights with helping cats out of trees or carrying 
furniture or painting the old barn or carving statues for public places or 
performing great works of art in public squares or engaging in honorable jousts 
(everyone's invited) or traveling abroad and learning the ways of the world to 
share with their homeland.

I dunno something less flashy but more "health care, housing, and climate 
change solutions"-y

A Firefox add-on / plugin that lets you open up a comment section on *anything* 
on the Internet. Your comments would be saved and you could sort them by "new" 
or "best (most up votes and fewest downvotes)" or "hot (most recent upvotes)" 
or "controversial (biggest differential)"

The idea would be to create a shared collective experience of the Internet that 
was exchanged using an open standard or protocol that could not be ignored - it 
was synced by everyone who used the add-on for every website you visit, torrent 
style.

 -> file: messages/0231.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would work best if it was "town square style" instead of "federated style" 
because federations are based on trust while town squares are explicitely based 
on geographic proximity. Which should be something you can scale easily (little 
slider on the side, oriented vertically up and down, that determined how close 
the comments you see should be)

Federations exist in mastodon. But we still need a town square. We need the 
ability to visit other town squares, through the ability to project our voice 
as infinitely far as they'd like to listen. But we also deserve the capability 
to interact with those close to us on a topic-by-topic basis, aka each and 
every individual web page that the Internet sees fit to create.

 -> file: messages/0232.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With this capability we could organize based on common interests. A person 
might see a link on a mastodon server and comment on it there, in a public 
forum with their comments limited to people within 50km or 25 miles of where 
they currently were. No other clients would receive a downloaded version of 
their comment, meaning the data simply wouldn't flow to others beyond that 
region.

Every time they logged in the syncing software would attempt to share their 
words with whoever would listen.

========================

Luck will always abandon you when you are vulnerable. So don't plan around it - 
American soldiers arrived on the beaches of Normandy and found that their 
assumptions for the production capabilities of their foe were completely out of 
proportion to the estimates they had made back at home - for every Nazi tank, 
there were 10 or 20 American ones, with more rolling off the factory floor 
every day! It was a killing blow that sent an incontrovertible message: you 
have lost, wholely and completely. Then, the atomic bomb, and the war was ended.

The tanks won the war, the bomb ended it.

*the blood of the soviets bought time to build those factories* 

Factories which were then turned against them in the cold war. Funny how that 
works.

saw this thing for 2 seconds in my dream last night. It's kinda cursed. I think 
the tank blew me up with a machine gun?

the remaining ~10 minutes of the dream was pretty neat though. I was a secret 
agent for a bit, I got in a knife fight (which I won because I had killer 
instinct and the other guy just knew how to stab) and afterwards I retired in a 
socialist commune in a log cabin full of sunlight and warmth somewhere in the 
mountains in the forest. I was alone with others, like the hobbits after LotR.

Also an old lady tricked me which was not nice, I was very polite with her but 
apparently "ma'am there's been a safety incident, I need to get you to a safe 
place" is not the kind thing to say to the person distracting you. >.>

Also, "but we like you!" is not an excuse, the military does not care if you 
like them or not, if you're part of the modern bourgeoisie you are causing harm 
to the country. We don't look fondly on slavers.

an fps map where one team has the height advantage (battlements on a castle 
perhaps) and the other has to push through their field of fire to get to the 
objective

the trick is that the people on the ground have hitscan weapons, but the people 
on the high ground have slower projectiles. Meaning the snipers have no cover, 
and the rocket launchers don't need to dodge.

I believe this would upend the traditional dynamic and reduce the negative 
aspects of both playstyles - traditionally, snipers will getcha from halfway 
across the map (but really they are much closer and in cover, you just didn't 
see them, n00b) while projectile classes need to dodge (skillfully) and get 
close enough that their attacks have a chance of hitting the target.

In the proposed map style, snipers would get no cover but be forced to dodge, 
introducing variability to their aiming in a way that may be more fun to some. 
In addition, the projectile classes must take care to utilize cover effectively 
without falling off the thin battlements.

@grimalkina 

In the 2000s when the Bush administration prevented people from working with 
stem cell research I remember my father going on rants about the same kind of 
thing.

"They're limiting our access to information and the future of humanity because 
of their religion!" that kind of thing

I loved listening to him. He was so passionate about that kind of thing. I 
think he got a little disillusioned sometime between now and then, because now 
he just tries to do the best he can with what tools he has available to him. 
And I love him for it.

He (mostly) abandoned his grand narratives because as the right got worse, the 
"left" sorta stayed the same, and he never forgave them for that. He still 
votes, and he'll still rant about that kind of thing, but only the stuff that 
affects him personally - like electric cars or cannabis or things like that. A 
democrat through and through.

He lives in a different country now, and I wish I could see him. But I cherish 
our phone calls and the few holidays when he visits.

@PacificNic 

you say "closest" instead of "closer", and I think that's a flaw in your 
perspective.

We remember COVID. We remember because it happened just a few years ago. We saw 
how our governments reacted, how ill-equipped they were to protect us. We began 
to question what their purpose was, if not to serve and protect the people. Our 
eyes were opened.

Give it some time. The zoomers are blossoming, and they're fucking awesome.

Here's another toot that's on my front page right now:

"The number of workplace strikes in America hit a 23-year high last year.

The number of workers on strike jumped nearly 300% from 2022.

It’s a historic moment for the labor movement.

Workers are done letting billionaires and corporations hoard all the wealth and 
power."

https://masto.ai/@rbreich/111971186034116228

Do not lose hope. The tide is just now turning, and you relent? Have faith, 
we're on the other side of the hill now. Our future is bright, and we shall 
define it's color together.
