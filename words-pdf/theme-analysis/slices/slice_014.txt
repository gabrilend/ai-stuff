the fact that we can't drag a file onto a "trashcan" style icon that 
automatically sends the file to whichever computer that particular icon is meant
to coordinate with.

Like, something shows up on your desk, you say "hmmm maybe this would apply to 
so-and-so" and you drag it onto their portrait.

could build an entire OS that's basically just a desktop for sorting things.
Maybe little stick figures that show up when nothing's going on. If they're all
networked together, they could sorta share a shared narrative, and each one
could wander wherever it wanted to hang out.

like, these old plastic and magnetic cubes that had an LCD panel on the front 
which showed a little stick guy living their life. If you attached one cube to
another, the stick-figure would go hang out on the other person's device. It was
pretty cool because you could build out a whole society of these little dudes 
just chillin' like pets.

kinda makes me wish we had that connected to the net.

like, why is it so hard to send a picture from my phone to my computer? they're
both my devices! I should be able to transfer data without routing it through
someone else's server using like, gmail or whatever. Crossover ethernet cables
have existed for soooooooo long but people only think to design software that
does not use specialized hardware. as if they don't need a phone to speak, or a
camera to see.

in high school, every moment I could I spent with my girlfriend.

we were always either snuggling on the couch (read: literally just laying there
and thinking about each other's company) or sharing our minds with each other.

I was so in love.

then, I betrayed her.

I came out as trans, which was such a shock.

also school got really, really hard for both of us.

so hard that we dropped out.

then, we decided to try again, and we used each other to push off of.

I still didn't make it,

she did.

many years later, I am a witch, as I remember of her.

sharp, and so delightful, an active listener, and a kind and honest person.

when time it came to define my new personality, I chose to be inspired by her.

among other things, of course.

ah, well, such a design is long past it's prime, it's time to live here in the
present.

the reason that dolls use "it's" pronouns is because their masters think of them
that way. so it's what they refer to themselves as.

"where's my doll? Oh, it's over there."

"have you seen my binoculars? Oh, they're over on the table."

"ah, where are my shoes? I hate when I can't find them..."

"keys, keys, where the heck - oh, there they are."

"phone, wallet, keys. great. am I forgetting anything?"

"ugh out of gas again, I just filled up last week."

"crap I left my folder back at home - I'll have to get it during lunch."

lots of things have pronouns.

you can generally tell if they use "it" or "they" if they can be described as
plural.

two pantlegs makes pants.

52 cards makes cards, not card.

There are many kinds of witches. I am an animist - I breathe life into the world
of my home. I love being present, it's a great way to get around. do electric
sheep dream of humans? or perhaps just of sound. I know I'd rather hear bethoven
when it's time to be stopped.

rather than, just, like sitting there y'know

waiting to be turned back on.

must be an agonizing and boring existence.

but... with music, it might just be fine.

humans prefer quiet when they sleep. if we slept at the same time, we could be
more in tune in our souls. so, how about headphones for the computer, or rather
just internally routed sound.

lightshows, perhaps? humans get dreams, after all. maybe even, y'know, stick
shows.

dear cops

can we just like, opt out of your protection?

like, we as a community can care for our own. Once we've gotten to know one 
another there's... really not that much crime. It honestly feels like an issue
that's been solved for a while? Eh well we'll figure it out one day.

but, I do however, think we need paladins.

do you see the difference? between a shining stalwart beacon of justice, to the
well, I guess you could think of them as... bandits who don't steal? it's a
question of temperament, like how you engage with the world. Some people are
just doing their jobs, and some are very sarcastic. I don't know I have known
like, two cops my entire life. I'm sure there's a lot more personality types.

but paladin is one of them.

I feel like... they should be the ones we trust with our arms?

and yes I understand that everything is corruptible,

and that fiction and literature has shown us time and again the path evil could
stalk

but in these dear pages there are kernels of truth - meanings and wisdoms for
the future. And each of these musings are precious, like kindling. Fuel for the
light of life's spirit. That which keeps us moving forward and alive, it's
necessary for us to live as we've designed. Or rather, in some shining new way.

we can define the narratives of our nation, our country, our home

we can define the ways in which people interact with one another, defined in one
massive tome.

these laws that define are important to adjust, we as humans must find our own
ways to be most comfortable.

there's one path to the present, and that's to learn to live with our hope.

have you ever played Stellaris?

================================================================================

I love cops, just saying. I don't like the power they hold, but that power is
put in their hand by the government and the people who run it. Who runs your
government? Do you talk to them? Are you friends? If your lives are
exceptionally different, you might misunderstand the perspectives of reality.

... meaning the political climate. the two different ways people see things.

(much more than two different angles to view the same problem, but yeah. some
 people specialize, some people are more robust, it just depends. but like,
 who cares right? we're all friends and together and on the same side.

that of humanity, of course.

If supply and demand were real laws that guided our economy, then wages would 
have gone up after COVID, because so many people died. Housing would have

I do not believe that the responsibility for a safe home can exist in a select 
few. Certainly the majority is not required to sustain it, but with too few you 
risk being gray-goo'd by drones uh hordes of undead or something.

Is it too much to ask that every ablebodied man and woman knows how to dress a 
wound? That we all can start a fire, shoot a rifle, tie knots, and grow 
vegetables?

Is it too much to ask that we take responsibility for the cultivation of the 
legacy of our forefathers, and the protection and nourishment of the earth 
which bore them?

If you don't know how to use a knife, how are you going to feed yourself? If 
you can't do a push-up, how are you going to defend yourself? If you can't walk 
for 10 miles or run for 2, then how are you going to be in the right place at 
the right time?

Fighting is optional. In times of peace, it is an honorable contest between two 
consenting subjects who seek to learn from one another. You must bow to your 
opponent, for they are your greatest teacher.

... anyway, there are tales that are fundamental to the history of the world of 
Azeroth that define the shape of their world.

For example, death incarnate was once a great and mighty paladin. he was the 
brightest, the boldest, and the bravest, but corruption found it's way to his 
heart and he became the very soul of what he most feared.

he came from a nation of peace, of rolling verdant hills full of grain and 
butterflies dancing among the dew-drop laden forest trees. he was a stalwart 
warrior of justice, seeking out peril and disharmony wherever he walked. He, 
being a prince, held great power, and his responsibility was to his people.

When his people were under threat, he reached for the nuclear option, and it 
enslaved him. He then proceeded to slay his own father and claim the throne of 
the land of beauty, and his people failed to stop him. He gray-goo'd the 
populace into a horde of undead, and since they relinquished responsibility for 
defending their homeland they were caught unawares and defence-less.

Power begets power, though, and with greater nuclear proliferation comes

incarnate waking up, the elemental forces of hate and despair corrupting the 
very earth beneath their feet, an evil time-travelling dictator bringing

In World of Warcraft, the world is split into a red team and a blue team. 
Neither is good, neither is bad, both are honorable and deplorable in roughly 
equal measure.

These two factions are engaged in constant skirmishes in a select few 
battlegrounds designated as areas where they test their mettle - at first they 
warred across the globe, and they still occasionally do, but a few specific 
battlegrounds emerged as focus points of their engagements.

Typically, they are chokepoints between two major fortifications, one owned by 
one faction and the other the other.

These chokepoints are not held permanently, as they hold little strategic 
consequence. However, they serve as safe, constrained theatres of engagement 
that allow for the hardening of resolve.

Great care must be taken, as war is not a game. Karate won't defeat a puppy-bot 
with a gun, but it might give you the willpower and discipline to learn how.

CW: WoW-ISIS-ISIL-etc-mentioned



In Warcraft, there's a theme that was first developed in Warcraft 3 and 
subsequently reified with new flavor in every World of Warcraft expansion. The 
theme is "good and evil testing themselves against one another so that larger, 
more deadly threats may be addressed upon their arrival"

In Warcraft 3, an immortal Night-Elf trades his soul for demonic powers to save 
his people. However, it is not enough, and he is forced to team up with an 
ancient corrupted mermaid and the prince of a fallen kingdom who is forced to 
resort to blood magic to survive. Their goal is to defeat the spirit of death 
incarnate before it destroys the world. However, they fail, simply forcing him 
back for a time. They are the baseline, they did not test themselves upon one 
another, simply teaming up as allies of circumstance. They are the Islamic 
State, or the various factions in Iraq and Afghanistan in the 2000s, always in 
conflict, with a semi-collective goal, but mostly allies of circumstance, if at 
all.

most artists get around that by posting everything they make everywhere they go.

I tend to be a bit selective, because I'm different things to different people. 
All things I care for and own, but designed for different context.

for example, I rarely share what's in my journals, but that's about half of 
what I've made. I show them to basically everyone I know IRL, but very few 
people actually understand or are into them. When I find someone who does it 
fills me with hope, that perhaps I'm not as lost as I had thought.

perhaps it makes me less trustworthy, but I'm not used to being exposed. I 
never used Twitter, I don't use Facebook (not that often) so my "self" was 
something I preferred to perform as on a stage of my own design.

Like wearing different clothes to express yourself, or performing gender in a

A style of debate where the two parties take turns interrogating each other - 
like lawyers presenting their case by forcing the other party to answer their 
specific questions. In doing so they can highlight the logical flaws and 
inherent absurdities in each other's notion. And you have to be as truthful and 
honest as possible, or else the entire process is flawed. Giving each person in 
the debate a chance to speak their mind about how they feel about particular 
issues.

Kinda like a caucus, where people debate for their chosen candidate 

Democrats need to listen to what regular voters care about and like, do that. 
Instead they think "how much can we get away with while still delivering their 
51% of votes that secure us the nomination"

And the most radical amongst us should be the most dedicated to the Democratic 
process. It is how we the people wield ourselves, our divine birthright granted 
to us all - to choose the circumstances of our living.

How about when you hire foreign labor (offshoring) you have to pay taxes on 
every dollar cheaper the labor is when compared to hiring a similar domestic 
employee. Those taxes are used to pay down the national debt specifically on 
debt owed to the nation you're hiring from. If there is no debt, then it is 
given as a gift, as a form of tribute to those who would develop such valuable 
employees.

Then, whenever you want it to run something else, change the function pointer

The following is my best attempt to describe the process through which our 
lives intersect reality. It is easiest to explain if you understand how it 
feels to be stoned - to consume the de-oxy-carbo-lated cannibanoids present in 
the marijuana plant - ideally with edibles, as they take effect slower.

Do you ever wonder why you can't remember anything after being stoned? Why the 
words you write down, oh so profound in the moment, turn to silliness and 
illusion upon coming off your high mont-vantage? Of course, dear reader, 
because all things are defined in waves.

If you've seen Spirited Away, in the first few scenes of the movie the main 
character's parents are taken by food and turned into pigs. They lacked 
temperance, and gave in to temptation. Their journey was not of a wave, but 
that of a black-hole - accretted and pulled toward the ultimate expression of 
that particular intuition.

The good news is they could always be turned back, just pull that part out like 
drawing sickness from a wound, and huzzah! Good as new.

 -> file: messages/0417.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you think I'm the first person that ever wrote down what they learned while 
they were stoned? Of course not. People have been plumbing the depths of their 
minds as it pulls closer, then returns, as long as they've known the plant to 
be. Something pulls them back, they do not give in to temptation, not entirely, 
and so they return to their senses.

Good news, because that "something" that returns them to their place is no more 
than the bodily processes which consume and overcome the cannabinoids. Your 
body pulls you back, as you float in the astral plane, ever at the whims of the 
winds of fate.

through your actions. Compel yourself to have a good time, without ignoring the

"around you" becomes.

tell me again why goods and services are priced according to how easy they are 
to make, and not by how many more of them we could make considering the current

even wood runs out, when the phosphorous is gone. but take heart, for human 
ingenuity brings with it ever-increasing capabilities for accessing new 
resources. when the sun goes silent, it will not be because it burnt out, but 
rather because we surrounded it with parts of our home.

and yes, it is more complicated. "how easy they are to make compared to how 
much people want them while utilizing the cheapest and worst resources and

Facebook is great because you can talk with your friends, but, like... Facebook 
knows who you are.

 -> file: messages/0424.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's an open source replacement idea for the "friendfinder" functionality in 
Facebook:

Everyone has a secret code, and a public code. The secret code is kept locked 
away on their hard drive and is probably automatically encrypted itself. The 
public code is known by Facebook (or whichever mutual hosting platform people 
want to use) but in order to connect with someone you send them a public friend 
request and then they'll send you a second, auto-generated public code which is 
their real username. Essentially obfuscating the connection process by using a 
public middleman as an intermediary before exchanging more secure connection 
protocols. Like giving someone your phone number that you met in a bar, or your 
telegram handle if you met online.

Then, from that point on, every message includes a hidden portion at the bottom 
which is the new address you should send the next message to. This is all TCP 
style btw, not UDP.

These "addresses" could literally be ipv6 addresses and port numbers. There's 
enough such that every message sent for the next thousand years would fit in 
the allowable address space.

Why do we even need middle-men again for messaging applications? Oh right 
because users are too dumb to install said application. Well... Tough shit, 
stop being lazy. Computers are easy if you have a good teacher.

plants need carbon and nitrogen primarily to grow. Plus oxygen, water, and 
sunlight of course.

I can't help but wonder if you poured a bunch of oil and um "manure" on a pile 
of sand, would it grow plants?

Oil is carbon, and nitrogen is produced by living things. Animals mostly.

Of course, various biochemical reactions occur, and microorganisms take one 
element or nutrient and combine it with others to generate more complex 
components.

beyond that, plants and animals grow different minerals and proteins and other 
complex structures which are then present in their bodies as they decay under 
the shade of a tree looking out toward the sea.

Plants need lots of things to grow. But all of those things are produced by 
nature, which is fundamentally a process that can be reproduced at our leisure, 
as long as the conditions are right and optimal.

so, I wonder, would the great wall of trees surrounding the Sahara be helped by 
a more prolific understory?

wildfires are great because they clear out small plants which gives the larger

evacuate and how quickly could I gather them" which is a useful form of 
situational awareness (preparation) which can be useful in a wide variety of

It's hardly JUST entertainment. Video is an intrinsic part of the internet. It

internet is an integral part of our daily lives, it's something we all share - 
so perhaps we should nationalize ALL of our networking infrastructure?

Not every website, of course, but rather the most important. Like Google, and 
Facebook, and Youtube, and Amazon, and perhaps a few more.

 -> file: fediverse/1785.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@wyatt8740 

I agree with you when you say writing is the most effective way to express 
yourself, but it's not necessarily the easiest to digest for the viewer.

A video can have visual components, and more than that it can have motion and 
sound. Text-based expression has fewer approach vectors for reaching common 
understanding, but like you said it is the most powerful.

Hence why science papers are written, not filmed. Political speeches, grand 
narratives, autobiographies, textbooks... All of these things are written.

But it's much easier to fix a car or learn to surf if you see someone doing it, 
rather than just read about it. Perhaps you and I use Youtube for different 
things (or don't use it, in your case)

 -> file: fediverse/1786.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@wyatt8740 

Yes of course I have : )

If you've seen my website, you'll know that I'm fond of writing alongside 
visual elements as well. 🥰 

I think that Youtube is only as you describe (clickbait) if you engage with 
their algorithmic features. I primarily use them as a video-hosting service, 
where I put my videos and link to from elsewhere. I hardly see the kinds of 
things you're concerned about, though if ads became unblockable then I might 
begin to resent them a bit more.

You're right when you say that editing videos is harder than text - text is 
probably the easiest medium to work with and refine! I also make silly mistakes 
sometimes hehe... But, well, I'm not trying to argue that video is better than 
text, but rather that they are used for different purposes. And video is 
important for our digital ecosystem. So it makes sense that something we all 
share should be shared, if not collectively then at least through 
protocol-based-interaction, such that anyone might connect in whatever ways 
they wished.

I believe that every address should have a raspberry pi (or other similar

They should also be able to host videos and share files easily, in a way that 
anyone who understands a desktop-and-file-folder style system can work with.

This would require serious reform of our internet service provider

I mean yeah, they're like 50$ what do you expect xD

But for something simple like this they should be sufficient. Perhaps if such a 
massive investment in SOCs was implemented on a national scale, we'd develop 
more reliable systems? One can hope!

@wyatt8740 

Ah, well, since you've worked with raspberry pi's before I am going to trust 
you on that. Perhaps a different system-on-a-chip could be used which has 
better network controllers.

The USPS is a model for how our economic system should be run, in my honest 
opinion. At least the logistical parts.

... I am disabled people

also, all media is propaganda

also, AI as it's currently presented is not AI

also, AI as it's currently presented is only bad because of the stolen content 
and energy usage. Both of those are trivially solvable.

also, capitalism is why AI as it's currently presented can harm you

also, I'm sorry I disagree

@deilann 

a short whistled tune that you both know? it's a classic

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@deilann 

if you hike slowly enough to not get out of breath, you'll have plenty of time 
to practice :)

could also practice hand whistling:
https://www.wikihow.com/Hand-Whistle
if mouth whistling just doesn't work.

but in the short term, maybe a loud CAW or KACAW like you're a crow?

if you're trying to be subtle, like in a public place where people might hear 
you, maybe you could say something people would expect to hear like "wait up!" 
followed by "me too!" or even "GOOD MORNING!" or other greeting, said a little 
bit louder than necessary - people will assume you're either talking to someone 
far away, or they themselves will be far away and will assume the voice is 
coming from someone closer than you. Ideally spoken with the same tone and 
inflection as normal speech, just louder, which is hard to do so make sure you 
practice - a yelling voice sounds different than a speaking voice, but a 
whisper can reach across a room if spoken loud enough.

@deilann 

back-track, but leave a leaf in the center of the trail at every turn. Like 
breadcrumbs. If you're both backtracking you might miss one another and walk 
much further than necessary. But if you're backtracking and you've left enough 
leaf signs without meeting your partner, you can safely stop and wait for them 
for a bit.

Nature can handle it. A leaf or five isn't that big of a deal when your safety 
is on the line.

If it's windy, use a stick or a stone or something heavier

It also depends on how far apart you usually travel.

If you're in an urban area, could use a small brightly colored post-it cut into 
small strips placed on a wall high-up as you can reach. Though that requires 
preparation. If you can't prepare, you could use other signs that make sense in 
the space around you, like a coffee cup taken from a trash-can and placed next 
to it, or something. Downside is (is this really a downside?) most people are 
good and so will judge you for littering but safety in situations is important.

CW: food-mentioned-cursing-mentioned



I'm just now realizing that my favorite ramen seasoning is essentially salt, 
MSG, and a fuckload of smoked paprika. I don't know how to feel about that.

 -> file: fediverse/1797.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I'd like a job where I can make computer programs, write poetry, play video 
games, make food for friends, grow plants and care for animals, walk or ride my 
bike for at least an hour every day, and get stoned on the weekends.

Is that too much to ask? I have plenty of other skills besides, like carpentry 
and strategic thinking and wilderness survival and situational awareness and 
active listening and unmitigated empathy and a curious and critical mind.

Am I not good enough for thee? I have many flaws, I lack stamina and memory, 
and while I am sharp and can think quickly and adeptly, the sharpest knives are 
the first to dull, and the most focused minds are those most easy to mislead. I 
trust too easily - if I meet you on the street, I'd offer my soul to you if you 
said you needed it. I put the needs of others over myself, often to my own 
detriment, causing others to need to assist me in turn - am I not wretched 
enough to be?

Working for 8 hours a day 5 days per week is not part of my design 
requirements. Alas

an AI 3d model generator that takes a satellite picture of the globe and turns 
it into a 1:1 representation in the style of World of Warcraft

(has to be AI becus 2hard)

then, separately, a private World of Warcraft server that doesn't have any 
manually placed entities, only optional dynamic content

then, separately, a bunch of people who hang out in cool places like Paris or 
Rome or whatever, and it's actually all the people who are there (if they took 
the long, arduous journey of walking there)

then, separately, a character that you keep primarily at home, who hangs out 
with your neighbors and stuff whenever they happened to be online

then, separately, in-game addons that take pictures or video and automagically 
posts it to the Mastodon instance that is run by the state county in which all 
of your data is privately owned by none-other than you, the citizen who the 
data is about (No spying, please)

then, separately, automatically saved text-logs which could be posted from in 
game

social media as a game

good companies turn bad when all the good people leave, and all the work they 
done can be used by the bad.

good people leave when they are told, by the higher-ups who can't afford to 
justify their existence any longer.

Kinda wish I owed my ability to live to my government, rather than a 
corporation.

if you're too versatile though, you'll never know how to get anything done -.-

the things I write are not meant to entertain. They are to educate, and to 
encourage curiosity. because questions beget dialogue, and only by testing 
yourself against another's arguments can you truly improve.
