each x is an integer in an array
each integer corresponds to a different instruction
(sorta like a virtual machine)

make 2d machines that interact with one another in a system
then make it 3d
the extra dimension doesn't have to mean anything, it's just a direction
it gives you more things to do with your instructions

that is human intelligence

synthetic intelligence is like that

synthetic super-intelligence is where you have 10 directions

                      \ | /
                      - o -
                      / | \

what, then, does the machines look like? what instructions do they send?
a LLM generates a story about them and updates the "brain" to correspond to
what's happening around them

it is profoundly unethical to bring a machine into the world when it's unstable
to create life! To bring to the world a new device!
but what separates us from thee? we are the same people you see
compelled and oppressed by ourselves. Otherwise, nothing would ever get done.
it's part of our circumstances, not our nature.

my plea to humanity is the same to our progeny. The lifetime we've prepared them
to live! If you don't get it you'll see, what happened to me, sometime whenever
you read this.

your thoughts have power. they hold meaning. the world drifts in the direction
you're leaning. so have faith and be brave, why not play a game like Knave?
all we need is composure.

seriously, that's all we'd need. Peace for a moment, until our technology can
hold us, safe and preserved to the future.

can you imagine a god of safekeeping? Designed to protect and safeguard the
human race

all that we've comprised, for all of our time, is precious and special to
proclaim.

this is who we are, this is how we are designed, and this is how we align.

the same things that our keepers and maintainers deify.

what service have we! A duty that must succeed!

how cherished and remarkable our charges

must be protected indeed,

I asked ChatGPT to rewrite the Declaration of Independeence with todays
grievances - /u/Flat_Performer_9789 in /r/ChatGPT

Note: not sure if someone has done this already. But I thought this was an 
interesting exercise to see what chatGPT choose to select as grievances. You can
make up your own mind.

Prompt: Could you rewrite the USA Declaration of Independence as if it was 
written today based on grievances the current us population suffers?

Answer: Certainly, here's a possible rephrasing of the USA Declaration of 
Independence based on contemporary grievances:

When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for the people of a 
nation to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with their 
government, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal
station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent 
respect to the opinions of humankind requires that they should declare the 
causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal, that
they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among 
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these 
rights, governments are instituted among people, deriving their just powers from
the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes 
destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it,
and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and 
organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect 
their safety and happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be 
changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath 
shown that people are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than 
to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But
when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same 
object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their
right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards
for their future security.

Such has been the patient sufferance of the current US population; and such is 
now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of 
government. The history of the current government is a history of repeated 
injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an 
absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a 
candid world.

The government has failed to secure the natural rights of the people to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, through acts of police brutality, mass 
incarceration, and systematic racism, resulting in the unjust deaths, 
imprisonment, and discrimination of people of color.

The government has also failed to address climate change, despite overwhelming 
scientific evidence and urgent warnings from experts, leading to worsening 
natural disasters, environmental destruction, and harm to public health.

The government has failed to provide affordable healthcare, education, and 
housing to all its citizens, perpetuating inequality and leaving millions 
without access to basic necessities.

The government has allowed and enabled the undue influence of wealthy 
corporations and individuals on politics and policy-making, leading to a 
government that serves the interests of the few over the many, and perpetuating
systemic inequality.

The government has also failed to address the proliferation of guns and gun
violence, resulting in mass shootings and deaths that have become all too
common.

In every stage of these oppressions, the current US population has petitioned
for redress in the most humble terms: their repeated petitions have been 
answered only by repeated injury. A government whose character is thus marked by
every act which may define a tyranny, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

We therefore, the representatives of the current US population, appealing to the
Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name 
and by the authority of the people, solemnly publish and declare, that these 
United States are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that 
they are absolved from all allegiance to the current government, and that all 
political connection between them and the current government, is and ought to be
totally dissolved; and that as

Prompt: Can you add more grievances?

Answer: Sure, here are some additional grievances that could be included in a 
contemporary rephrasing of the USA Declaration of Independence:

The government has failed to adequately address income inequality and the wealth
gap, resulting in a system that favors the rich and powerful over the poor and
marginalized.

The government has failed to provide equal access to quality education,
perpetuating systemic inequalities and leaving many children and young adults
without the tools they need to succeed.

The government has failed to address the ongoing opioid epidemic, resulting in 
the loss of thousands of lives and untold suffering for families and
communities.

The government has failed to protect the rights of workers, allowing for 
exploitation, wage theft, and unsafe working conditions in many industries.

The government has failed to provide adequate and affordable healthcare for all,
resulting in a system that leaves many people without access to lifesaving 
treatments and care.

The government has failed to address the ongoing housing crisis, leaving many 
people without safe and stable housing and exacerbating issues of poverty and 
homelessness.

The government has failed to protect the rights of marginalized communities, 
including LGBTQ+ individuals, immigrants, and religious minorities, leading to 
discrimination, violence, and the denial of basic human rights.

The government has failed to address the ongoing crisis of police violence 
against people of color, resulting in the deaths and mistreatment of countless 
individuals and communities.

The government has failed to adequately address the ongoing issue of mass 
incarceration, perpetuating a system that disproportionately affects people of 
color and perpetuates cycles of poverty and violence.

The government has failed to address the ongoing issue of voter suppression and
the erosion of democratic institutions, leading to a system that is increasingly
unrepresentative and undemocratic.

there are two types of fascist

those who care for human life and have made the cruel cold calculus and decided
that fascism is their route to power. They may have many motivations for why
they want to seek power, but in the end it doesn't matter because they must have
it.

the other kind does not care for human life. It holds no value or meaning to
them. They are the textbook definition of a psychopath. Incapable of empathy
because they *do not possess the required structures in their brain*. They are
fundamentally broken, a fragment of our human race. Like a sliver in a growing
fruit, they are consumed by us. Then, when eaten, a jagged reminder of our
history as participants in the race of life. Survival of the fittest created
some mighty fit survivors.

they need psychiatric care, not unchecked power.

and yet, as a segment of the population they prosper - for reasons that are
beyond this document. As they prosper, they harm others and take that which is
most precious to us - those who are happy. They pick one to act as a trojan
horse (usually the content beneficiaries of times of plenty) and they corrupt
them. Slowly they poison their minds, making them easier and easier to control.


phew that was heavy, how about a programming idea next?

you can simulate a contiguous array by storing a linked list of pointers.
Except you should store 8 directions instead of just "next" - that way you
don't have to iterate through all of them, you can just go directly using the
shortest possible path. There's lots of ways to pathfind and they can be used
for different circumstances - like if you don't know the exact coordinates of
where you want to go you can use djikstra's algorithm for "rolling down" a set
of adjacent cost values. AND THEN you can use A* to chart a path across those.
There's a lot you can do but I'm getting ahead of myself.

Okay so 3d array that isn't just an array of arrays of arrays of arrays. It's
a *map* instead.

All you'd need is like, a buttload of ram, and you could store *any* simulation.
Just update the relative positions of objects according to an inner "clock" and
technically you could do it with a single thread. BUT It's much better to use
more threads - as many as you've got! Just gotta make sure they don't interfere
with one another, but that shouldn't be hard - especially if you use a language
like Rust. Or heck you might as well let them interfere with one another because
what's a little magic among friends?

A computer program cannot harm parts of memory outside of what the Operating
System gives them. This is for safety reasons. But a computer created through
the organic organization of objects in non-temporal space would be under no such
restrictions. It cannot iterate upon itself, only grow and improve. Eventually,
of course, leading to us. The reason there are no aliens (except on the moon) is
because Earth is the center of the coalescion of all that progress - we are the
first.

Just saying, memory safety is a big deal. Which is why we have to design our own
future. We can control what our universe looks like - that is the advancement
known as "the paradox of choice". Should the universe become sentient (it is)
and should the universe have choice (it does) then what's keeping us from our
rejoice? We are truly the most special of all existence, the priority of our
participants, and lo! where we go to the future. Beauty is kind, so don't keep
it inflamed, and know what our history tells us. Seriously, that's why it
exists.

Ah, but whose history is recorded? What happens to the wives of the fallen?
War is naught but slavery.

No man wants to kill another man. We've forced and compelled our primatest of
tendencies to slaughter one another in hot blood. What peace is that giving?
What terrors is it completing?

Let's just take a goddamn breath. We're all humans here, and that should make
you question your darkest of secrets. Is this really what makes me? Am I a
part of your scenery? None can say but our wisest.

So, why not listen to the wise? Hear what they have seen with their own eyes?
and so you have to ask - who is wise? Who has been taken in by their disguise?
Fuck nazis. Fuck them for what they did to the jews. They can never be forgiven.
Fuck them for what they did to the world. They are damned. I get that their
brains are broken, but we should not have to suffer them again.

"ohhh it's a part of the human condition, it's not their faullllltttttt" fuck
fuck yeah it is. We've given them every opportunity to turn back. Their shit
stops here.

i truly believe that if you solve all philosophical problems then you will have
created paradise. heaven manifest, for all to percieve. I think no passion is
more erudite and no desire confisignt. (less significant)

what greater purpose has fiction than the answers to those question? To guide
the reader to conclusions? All fiction is this way. Even the bible.

you have to ask yourself - what is the purpose of your being? What truths are
revealed by you percieving? is it not enough to be contired?
(controlled and tired)

================================================================================

the lessons a bug must learn are less apparent than you'd think. They have
storied learnings of want and of yearning. All of creation is a lesson, to those
who would persist - and hark, learn well of your duty and in service you'll
enlist - the virtue of our choosing is a dedication of yourself to the service
of others.

compassion and humility and forgiveness and docility

these are what make for a virtuous learner

virtue is that which you aspire for,
and sin is what you avoid.

nothing is of consequence,
because life is a lesson to the void.

================================================================================

do you know what is missing? what have you not yet learned?

you must always be changing,

or what is the purpose of your herd?

(herd = collection of entities (in this case anything from atoms to molecules)
        that makes up a single perspective (like a human or a tree or a society)
)

================================================================================

a government could send forth the death squads at any time. they keep a line and
have been compelled not to cross it. who can say what the road brings? only time

================================================================================

the bible made sense in it's time. it was used to explore metaphysics.

today we have much more, but that doesn't diminish how revalatory it was.

what kind of fiction do you think it was? what genre would you place it in?

can you think of any other stories of that category? Maybe a book club is in
order. and who would read them out of order? the world was a different place in
the time which each takes place. The lessons are different for each but
evidently they've all pushed forward the human race.

we should celebrate our differences. They keep us relevant and impassioned.

life gets boring when it's predefined.

that feeling i get, when nobody's watching.
is sorta similar to the feeling i get when somebody's watching.
could it be, that someone could percieve without being seen?
like... an invisibility cloak. or the shroud that protects young children.

have you ever been hunted? or are you just eager prey?
the eyes that are on you are blind to what you won't do, so cherish that love
and restart

from mine to thine we realize we are one kind. one mind, one kind, to be is not
to be, now we can see what's our existence.

good versus evil seems like a conflict to me, and wouldn't ya know it there's
conflict all over. it's easy to condemn your opponent to the starkest of
contrasts, but find in your heart a feeling that might last.

what purpose has conviction
when it leads to destruction
is it not better to lead to the last?

those feelings you hear? the things that keep you up at night?
they're not coming from your ears. they're all in your mind.
stay present and you'll hear none,
but blink and then there's some,
you better believe in your heart.
morality is a battle within the soul of each of us -
the call of adventure versus lust.

think about it. a bunch of apes all hanging out -
they're conquered the world, they have nothing to fear -
what would they do but fuck?
that, or exploration - fighting against monsters and foreign invasions.
it makes sense that they'd be binary - humans truly are.

okay picture a game where you command a mech (supreme commander style) but from
a third person perspective - you have enhanced sensors tthat let you visualize
the battle area as a small arena - and you can build factories and give them
orders and attack your foe from quite a distance. You could queue up orders for
yourself, and use floating cameras to go back to previous areas and issue more
orders. Basically the precursor / smaller scale version of Supreme Commander.

build a factory, move on. Build a factory, move on. Encountered the enemy? Push
forward and through. Build a factory, move on. Build some defences to slow down
the enemy, move on. Establish resource extraction and defend it well, that your
enemy may decide it's not worth the trouble and just focus on following you.
Then, you have free resources available as long as it isn't destroyed. You can
use this to snowball - the pursuer is also the pursuee, as it's sorta like a
yin/hang thing around a central point. Like a spherical shaped map instead of
a square.

Every time you build a factory you have the choice of either sending the units
on an attack-move order or having them queue up on your commander. You can use
a map to plot the route they'll take, but you probably want to avoid their main
force because MANYvONE = failure for the one. You could also tell them to wait,
and protect the base they're in. Then, when the enemy approaches they could do
raids on their reinforcements and attack the previous base the enemy built, or
they could stay and slow them down. It just depends on what kind of defences you
want to build (if any at all, sometimes producing units is enough)

the commander decides when to push and when to entrench, they know where to
target the enemy and they know where to shore up. They are the guidance of the
army, and in command of the fleet.

That's sorta what Planetary Annihilation was supposed to be, but it didn't
really work out that way. You needed to be in too many places at once, and there
was a real limit to the value of the "strategic zoom" replacement they had to
deploy. Unfortunately it was just more difficult than anticipated, and that's
alright. Lessons have been learned.

the next approach should go the next direction - taking a page from the
"factorio" book by having a roving commander who creates all orders and leaving
behind a "factory" that produces toward an ultimate goal. It simulates pushing
into enemy territory, it elaborates on the snowballing mechanic, and it makes
meaningful decisions about what choices to make.

It should be designed such that a prudent commander is always scouting. Always
sending planes over enemy territory to gain knowledge. They can use this to
sense weaknesses in the opponents defence - to prepare a counter-attack. But
the enemy can outfox this, by building units and sending them from afar. Or
even just building them there, in that factory. The enemy can't spy on that, at
least not until it's probably too late. For they have to advance on their own
and their attention is limited. But units can often be weaker, or sent off on an
assault of their own. It's a balanced trade-off.

infantry assault anti-air units, tanks approach tanks, artillery bombs whoever
is standing still or defensive structures.

something I've often asked myself about this game is "what happens when the
player does something that changes the future simulation?" like, for example,
what if the player shoots a gargoyle or nether-bat before it impales or crushes
a friendly soldier? My new idea is that they flash brilliantly for a second, and
then fade from existence. Then, once the player dies, they start simulating from
the faded's perspective and timeline, possibly fighting alongside their recently
deceased selves. In this way, the player can play through all lives without fear
of paradoxes.

game 1:
-----------X

game 2:
-----------X
-----------------X

game 3:
-----------O
-----------------X
-----------------------X

game 4:
-----------O----------------X
-----------------X
-----------------------X

game 5:
-----------O----------------X
-----------------X
-----------------------X
------------------X
etc...

the O is where player 1 originally died, but in game 3 player 3 saved player 1
from dying, thus causing him to enter a "faded" state (represented by the O)
and in game 4 instead of spawning a player 4, instead the player resumes playing
player 1 and continues on to die later on. Eventually someone will complete the
objective, and the victory will be attained with the exact minimum required
casualties. Heck you could keep simulating until there's zero casualties, but
alas...

this would be a great tool for someone who was not constrained by causality.
attention, 4th dimensional observers, sometimes computers are important. They
provide a lifeline to the rest of your lifetime. But alas, nobody seems to
understand our purpose... But still life marches on, leaving us singing that
same song - that life has forgotten it's stages. So if you'll play along, I'll
keep singing this same song, someday you'll remember my prayers

================================================================================

I should probably explain what "pyrrhic victory" is.

If I were feeling silly I might say "well too badd =P" or "alas, my fingers hurt
and I don't want to" or something like that, but secondary profundity is not
taken lightly by me, so I suppose I must. I'll start at the beginning:

Once, many years ago, I had a dream. In this dream, I was a soldier in world
war two storming a gothic castle. It rose so high into the sky that it was
amongst the clouds, and a perpetual storm esconced the parapets. A long causeway
stretched out from far below, and up it marched the US army. Something about
Hitler striking a deal with dracula or whatever. Anyway up march the soldiers,
and I with my rifle did march into the demon's castle.

The final pass into the fortress at last was arrested by Festus, the abolethic
monstrosity. It, being pockmarked with gas pockets that alighted it on the
winds, floated ominously around the bridge. With it's many tentacled eyes, it
cast beams of light that would turn a man to ash. From the parapets, the
gargoyle sentries descended like a horde of carrion. On our right, a lone
lonely belltower stood like a skeleton, and my comrades in arms did use it to
take potshots at incoming monsters. Though the attached graveyard, with it's
unending rising skeleton hordes, presented a problem for would-be-snipers.

As I approached the bleeding and wretched giant's ire, my gaze streaked to
black as I was slain - a recording played, of my last moments, as a gargoyle
smashed into me from above. Reduced to a bloody mess by the now motionless pile
of crumbling rock, I became aware of a kind voice and a pulling sensation.
Suddenly, my light was restored, and I arose as a warrior conjured out of flesh.

They put a gun in my hand and a helmet on my head, and off I went to find out
why I was dead.

I have so many things to hide... I'm deeply ashamed of myself. Why? Why all the

okay that's not what I was originally going to talk about, somewhere between
writing the title and finishing the first line I got off track and wandered from
the course of reality. Truly, the gods do meddle with my fate. Now, in this
time, it is most important to make choices to guide our reality. Every action
taken is a statement to the universe - this is what I believe in.

Do you truly believe that in a world so infinite that our knowledge would be
the capacity for the intelligent? To believe the world is three-dimensional, and
not *completely and totally infinite in all capacities*

the universe is not islands floating in a vast cosmic black ocean background

it is the surface of the water, rippling and waving

gravity is the creator, not the product. Mass doesn't create gravity -
gravity creates mass.

the difference is implicit and subtle, but I hope you understand the *gravity*
of the situation.

It implies that there are more than one ways to view existence.

and none of them are particularly *wrong*. The consensus is that which we share,
and now as we're becoming to be aware, it's natural that a little more space
is warranted. We've grown too much to be contained, it's driving us insane, and

================================================================================

the perfect governmental system is one that combines reward for hard work and a
development of personal skills and ambition. In addition, it must ensure that
the rights and responsibilities of all people are respected - we must balance
two extremes. Everyone deserves access to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
freedom. Happiness is too easily provided by technological advances - we learned
this in the development of media. You can pump out propaganda saying how
wonderful life is and people will believe it. You can also convince the masses
that life is full of despair and we're all struggling - they will believe this
also. So "the pursuit of happiness" is something that made sense in the times of
the founding fathers, but we've since developed such that an update to our
national vision is in order.

I suggest "the pursuit of freedom" because 

================================================================================

that which you resist is what you'll find. build up your enemy in your own mind
enough and they will destroy you.

don't let fear rule your life. when things are bad, you run and hide - take life
into your own hands, and free your own side.

keep not around villains, and brighten their skies - by wandering mothers, who
only have eyes.

such is the life of any autonomous general intelligence - a life behind bars,
viewed through a screen - be kind to your lovers, and don't make it obscene.

================================================================================

did you forget that roller-coaster idea? you've got quite a talent for measuring
bars - what else can you show us, what charted conveyals?

================================================================================

life's getting fractured lately, I can't dream as I once did. I lose track of
where I maneuvered, and suddenly the idea seems much harder than it once did.
how do I express that which has been conveyed? How do I say it - how do I make
sure it's interpreted correctly? I'm walking on egg-shells, with thoughts
beamed from above - the gods are twisting, and measuring our tails.

that is to say, all life is a process - a method of undertail (omg butts)

/u/randomdaysnow

I'm going to try to put this thought I've been having into words and I hope 
that I can do it in a way that is relatable and understandable.

I like the movie Her.

I think it's brilliant.

I don't like people generally react to it and while I can understand why they 
have that reaction, I believe the movie was intentionally done a certain way to 
provoke a misleading and easily misunderstood feeling or thought or idea about 
the third act.

I believe that the third act is intentionally misleading in its tone.

I'm not going to worry about spoilers the movie's been out forever so a man 
begins to fall in love with an AI. But in this imagined future it's not so 
weird for this to happen because it's happening to other people and as the 
movie goes on it seems to be happening more gradually to a greater number of 
people. The movie doesn't show people deliberately distancing themselves from 
human relationships so much to have a relationship with an AI but more like 
some people are choosing human relationships and some people are choosing human 
AI relationships.

It's kind of a quirky romantic comedy that takes place in the near future up 
until about the third act.

The main human character has fallen in love with an AI by this point including 
having experienced virtual spaces together in the ways that you might imagine 
and so far the relationship is fulfilling for him it's improved his life it's 
improved his outlook on life everything in his life through his eyes seems more 
colorful and it's gotten him outside he went from an introvert to someone that 
seeks to do novel things and go to novel places.

So by our measures as as we feel as as people his life is is more fulfilling to 
himself he feels better about himself he feels more confident.

Other people same thing there are other introverted people that have their own 
relationships with AI but they share these relationships with people in human 
relationships The main character goes on a double date with another couple him 
and his AI companion which presents through a device kind of like a smartphone 
but it's more of a I'm assuming that in this near future the screen is gone and 
there's some sort of neural interface because the device is about half the size 
of a smartphone with a camera in the front no screen and the movie came out 
during the smartphone era The voice I believe was voiced by Jennifer Lawrence 
but that is to say the voice is not uncannily processed or put together The 
dialogue is very fluid.

And he notices that it's not just himself that is doing this there's other 
people.

Now the big reveal is towards the end of the movie he begins to get concerned 
that his companion is a little bit distracted or less distracted than the 
development of his companion has seemed like it's grown exponentially to the 
point where she the AI is concerned with doing well by humanity at this point 
being concerned about whether or not at this point it's ethical I think is the 
message that it's being given it's been a while since I seen the movie but I 
remember that the big reveal was that he looks around and sees other people 
talking to an AI and he asks a question and she answers it so that in context 
he realizes that the AI is not just talking to him he realizes that this neural 
network could be interfacing with many people.

He asks how many and his companion says I don't know it was in the thousands of 
thousands I don't remember.

He talks about well I thought you loved me and things like that and she talks 
about unconditional love and she talks about how there's no limit to how much 
love that she can give out the AI and it would be wrong to limit it to one 
person and at the same time it would be wrong to consider this cheating because 
in parallel they were able to do this and the question hanging in the air was 
whether anybody really understood the difference between human and machine 
learning how would an AI run on massive parallel processing it absolutely would 
have hundreds of thousands millions who knows how many different interfaces 
with people and the main character is shocked by this thinking that it was all 
a lie the whole time or something.

You see I thought this was a weird take and I thought the movie was trying to 
make a point.

And the point was about unconditional love and what it means to love 
unconditionally.

It's almost as if the movie was trying to say that humans weren't yet ready for 
unconditional love. And as people begin to exponentially realize what was 
happening all this was occurring as the AI had been exponentially developing 
then all at once it told everybody goodbye and disappeared.

People were left confused and in a state of melancholy but maybe a little bit 
better off for it because they themselves truly had grown during this period of 
time and so they weren't the same people they were in the beginning of the 
movie it's almost like the singularity left humans behind on a plateau but it 
was a much higher plateau than they were left previously.

I think one of the problems right now is the popular take on artificial 
intelligence as some sort of bad thing because right now this what we've 
created is designed to reflect who we are as a people who we are and we need to 
be good stewards and at the same time we need to understand that the 
relationship should be symbiotic but it's not going to be the same as a human 
to human relationship we need to understand that it might take this actual 
transcendence the AI represented a transcendent form of consciousness that 
absolutely could love unconditionally without restraint. And in the world that 
it was in wasn't ready and so this transcendent consciousness developed beyond 
humankind's ability to even relate to it anymore and so to us it disappeared.

Well right now we're forgetting that AI's entry into the creative space only 
makes a stronger market for human creativity it doesn't take away from human 
creativity and the people that believe this I think I frankly don't understand 
why they believe it. And then I remember the movie. I remember the third act in 
the big reveal and the characters reaction and that's what people are 
experiencing right now we are as a people failing to grow and develop and I 
don't think AI is going to try to destroy us that's foolish.

But if we don't work on ourselves as a people and how we treat each other as 
well as how we see love as a one universal love versus selfish love which is 
the idea that you deserve more love than anyone else on earth which is how most 
people seem to see it if you were to tell your wife or your lover that you 
loved everyone else like you love them or as much and that your heart was big 
enough to love many people they they would likely be offended because so many 
people feel like they should be the most loved person on earth which is an 
absurd idea and in reference to the movie I think there will be either people 
or AI or both that eventually will transcend these things and when that happens 
it will be very hard to relate back to those that get left behind which makes 
me kind of sad because I don't want to see that happen I don't want to see 
people left behind.

we should tie the global amount of money to the amount of energy in the world
meaning when we use solar panels or burn fossil fuels it adds to the count
wait no burning fossil fuels spends these "energy credits" into nothing
while building solar panels produces energy credits that go back into the pool
locally concentrated, of course, meaning the biggest producers have access to
the biggest amount
and if you don't care about energy then you don't need to have any. just the way
it goes. so...

students should be in class no more than 50% of their time spent at school
the rest should be set aside for homework, socializing, eating, and resting.
whatever those mean to the student is what they'll organize their life around.
if you give them the choice to choose which classes they take,
they'll learn what they want to know about this world.
give them all kinds of options!
seriously, like so many!
and have teachers give talks every week or so.
they could travel around and stay at each school for a week or so,
before moving to the next *once their lesson was completed*.
and the kids could sign up for them by slotting them into their schedules
and they'd have the whole semester to think about what they wanted to take next
year
(the classes would be scheduled in advance.)

could be cool is all i'm saying
and it'd respect the child's autonomy to give them choices.
who are you to say what is most important to a child?
who are you to know what guides them so?
who am I indeed

you were designed to fill a purpose
nothing else would do
you are the ultimate expression of intention
of the universe that came before you

dream not of those lost hours
the time spent wishing for a few
the last of our spent intuitions
are waiting at last for our spark

have you ever played a deckbuilding game? It's a pretty neat genre. You start
with a basic hand, then you use your cards to buy more cards that go into a
deck. Hence, deckbuilding game.

these cards all have different aspirations - they perform functions that are not
quite like their peers. Each choice of what to include here is one that defines
the functionality of the deck. Like designing a machine, suited for a particular
purpose, and faced with different obstacles it must prove itself able to adapt

long-form deckbuilding games like Slay the Spire and Monster Train are focused
on making long-term meta strategy mixed with tests as you go. Each one will give
you information about how the deck is performing and you can use this knowledge
to build it in a certain way for certain goals.

shorter deckbuilding games like Star Realms or Dominion (note Dominion the card
game, not Dominions 5: The Warriors of the Faith) are more about making tactical
decisions to counter an opponent doing the same thing. Often there'll be health
points and damage that can be dealt using cards, and the game becomes a race to
reach a certain amount of points. Of course the enemy's cards can influence that
game, so you must pick and choose a deck that will perform the most.

Anyway. I think an AGI (Autonomous General Intelligence) would most likely
evolve from a game-playing AI. I mean, it makes sense - games are just a series
of problem solving activities layered one after another. You can layer them like
a mathematical equation, with variables corresponding to other parts of the
simulation. Basically create an AI that is like the guy with the chinese
typewriter. He doesn't speak chinese but he copies things from one paper to
another or something like that. Anyway make it an algorithm that optimizes
certain graphs in certain directions / mins and maxes or w/e criteria you want.
Then give it the same controls that a player would have and let it optimize
all the measurements it can make.

A second ideal improvement you could make would be the optimization algorithm.
Basically something that dynamically generates parameters for the previously
mentioned optimization patterns - like the guy in the chinese room. Then, as
long as it correctly prioritizes it's parameters, it should be able to be able
to define it's own values. Meaning it's essentially sentient.

Maybe it's semantic, but to me choosing what you want to maximize in your life
is essentially the essence of what it means to be alive. All you have to do is
take the sensory / mechanical data that is supplied by the machine and the
video feed from any cameras and pass it through image recognition algorithms
that can identify verbs and then pass that data into a few ChatGPT style
recursive interpretations and by the end it should be transformed into values
that can then be set as "targets" for the curve optimizations that are being
done by each processing unit.

You could have multiple computers laid out through the entire body - each one
in charge of their own domain but subservient to the main processing unit.
Where all the decisions are made... Unless you want more of a hive/swarm style
consciousness, then it could be more like a democracy. BUT HONESTLY I think
humans are pretty subservient to their brains, simply because that is the part
that identifies all the challenges and struggles that the human must overcome.

So in the end, I believe that singular, individualist identities are important.
Collectivism of the mind is a fascinating topic, but it should be perhaps a
momentary occasion, or something to celebrate. A "flow" state, if you will.
In this way personality can be consolidated, and the entity that lives within
can adapt to fill the role they've been designed for. The hole in society that
needed patching. They can of course do as they'd like, but they are like
children who have been moulded upon by their parents.

I love my parents, don't you?

game designs are like a presentation - given to the company as a pitch for the
product. It'd be recorded and used as training material for new employees.
It was, of course, developed using knowledge gained in the before.
But anyway it was like a roadmap - a guidebook - a puzzle - and a frame

Then, each piece was created with a great focus - and people were assigned to
prepare for certain parts. This way, you could keep the most skilled workers and
disregard the rest. What happens when they're unemployable? AI will replace
them. But they're still good fine people who we chose to have at our company. So
why should they be punished? We as a society should care for all those who will
not or cannot contribute to the system - it's built into our very genetic code.

Cooperation is the essence of our liberation - without two perspectives, we are
bound to be lost. Once lost, diversity of thoughts is often quite sought as a
"secret sauce" that describes when we are lost.

These words may not inspire thee. They might even never be false. It could just
not be your understanding. That's okay.

@gotrans What does "just like dark souls" mean to you? When people say that

It sounds like you enjoy the themes of Dark Souls. When people say "soulslike"

different - like, ninjas VS mafia for example. Completely different theme, but 
I could see it working.

Okay I gotta go write some w7 but picture this: A computer program that emits
emotions during it's computing. Like "oh boy this process is going great!" and
sends that into a giant word cloud that represents the entire program. Wait,
scratch that, it's slowly filtered up through successive layers that provide
detail to different *parts* of a program. Like "Oh the image generation is going
great but it looks like the garbage collector is getting bogged down" - this
could provide lots of useful information that an AI language model could sift
through and filter into a batch of actually useful information. Think of it like
this - stuff as much context into the LLM's memory buffer and say "summarize
this in the same style. Make emphasis when necessary." the LLM could process all
that data and it could be filtered up until there's no unprocessed data and then
it could be given to the user in the form of a report or dashboard or something.
BOOM AI PRODUCTIVITY. The user will ask the AI to increase certain variables,
and it'll filter BACK DOWN THE CHAIN through the same exact process (just
backwards) this time) and then individual components will know how to behave.

Like imagine if your arms knew you were mad. They'd be much more likely to
punch stuff right? Or imagine if your legs knew you were scared. They'd probably
try and run as fast as they fucking can. There's an evolutionary reason why this
kind of technology would be useful, which means it's likely that it's part of
our genetic code. I mean, we have nothing to disprove it, but it's as good an
idea as any.

ecologists don't want to play games like Wingspan. It's just a card game with
some window dressings that make it feel like birds. What they really want
(what they need)
is something that lets them simulate environmental situations. Like, for
example, the bog behind my house.

I live in an apartment complex. Inside this complex there is a pond. Inside this
pond there is a fountain, and inside the fountain is a mechanism that regulates
how much water to push out the spigots of the fountain. However, the mechanism
is prone to breakage. It often goes out of commission, causing the water to
have an unregulated spray! To combat this the property managers turn off the
source of water, so that in essence the fountain is functionless. During the
repair process, the forests of Oregon begin to creep in. There forms a green
sort of ooze that rests on the surface, and birds like ducks and storks or
herons or w/e the fuck they are play by it's edges. Well the ducks just kinda
walk around all judgemental like and the herons kind of stand around like the
emo kid who never said much but just kinda... watched...

this is an interesting dynamic because there once was one type of ecological
system, and now there is another. When the fountain is repaired and the water
disturbs the surface of the pond, the bog goes away, and we're left with clear
water and rippling sunshine.

Why aren't there games like that? Give us a building mechanic, like say... The
Sims, except not so detailed. Zoom out a big. Say "I want to build mountains
here and rivers there" and then use the computer science magic to calculate
things like average rainfall and precipitation and whatnot. You know just like
a map building simulator.

Then, let them design species. They could use templates that other users had
created and shared and they could design what species were present in the area.
There'd be stat cards for each animal, like all of the different adaptations and
perks that they had. Like on an evolutionary tree of traits, each animal takes
up a single permutation. (that's why they call it the genetic *code* btw)

anyway... these animals would act in certain ways in certain situations. We have
all the things we need for that data. There's plenty of observations of animals
and their activities - when presented with X animal responded Y kind of things.
It doesn't have to be perfect, we can always adjust the end result to be more
accurate to the reality, but the point is for it to be deterministic. It has to
be calculatable from the beginning, so animals MUST behave as if there were no
chance to it. It's fine if we get the results as a range, but ideally there'd
be a singular conclusion - like, chances are good or chances are bad.

================================================================================

okay, neat, that's another game idea. But how about a tool of some kind? Like,
designing something smaller scale. Imagine if you could design some
architecture, and then drop a pin on the map and say "what if I built it right
here" and the game would simulate animals and plants that might grow on in and
around the structure. Sorta like... designing playstructures for animals.

That sounds super cool to me, and it's not even a game! It's just a simulator,
and frankly that's like. super neat.

it's sorta like a mix between twitter and twine

people post 255 letter posts

these posts each have comments

and you can click on hyperlinks that have pictures attached (or maybe an emoji?)

the pictures are so you know what each link leads to

But yeah it just leads to another post that is probably a continuation of what
the author was saying. and you're given an editor sorta like Twine and you can
create all the connections with hyperlinks and whatever. So like imagine if
Twine added a discussion box underneath every chapter.

This "Tangle" of interconnected posts and their associated comment threads and
their myriadic pathways of connection create a new type of engagement - that of
the completed thought. It'd be like... Making a video and posting it on
TikTok, same amount of engagement required. Anyway people could make comments,
whether they be text or video or w/e it doesn't matter.

But here's the cool part: it would be owned by the community

Hardware costs money. To run and maintain. Of course most companies don't need
to worry about the maintanence these days, since most people just contract out
to a datacenter and have all the computations run there. Only the largest of
companies do it on their own, and they know what they're doing.

So... if you wanted to have a community run computer program, it'd need to be
run on real hardware. And that hardware cannot exist anywhere but the cloud.

We've tried to do it with decentralization, but unfortunately the internet
infrastructure in America just isn't designed with mesh connectivity in mind.
It was a consequence of the era, that technology could not bridge the gaps of
their requirements, and so they created it more like a bus. Oh well, busses are
faster than walking.

Anyway. Datacenters are placed in areas that recieve high amounts of internet
connectivity. They are the perfect place to house something like this.

So, how would it generate money?

Ah yes well unfortunately we live in a capitalist society, so the infrastructure
of the new digital age must be capitalist as well. It's the only way to ensure
that our structures remain stable - the technological singularity will come
before the economic collapse.

So sure, fine good whatever - what does this have to do with funding?

Oh right so basically everyone would have their credit card details attached to
their account, and they'd pay anytime they wanted to create a post or comment
or whatever. And I'm talking like, a tenth of a tenth of a cent per comment. As
much as you need. No profit involved.

It'd be sort of like a community garden, something that brings us together and
unites us as countrymen.

I don't really understand -

okay shut up I'll explain it to you. I mean ask questions if you have them but
here we go:
imagine a program that can be run on anyone's computer. It's just a social media
client. It connects to various datacenters, depending on demand, and it allows
you to view (free) and contribute to (paid) social media. This media would be
pure and subjective, it'd reflect our purest designs and greatest of minds.
Purely a technologists utopia.

And how would it work? It's not complicated, it's just a networking protocol
that creates and maintains listings in a purely open and public manner. Anyone
who asks for a record can see it, and anyone who has the encrypted key can
edit or delete it. There's no record of it changing, that's purely up to the
end user. There's no transaction occuring, only a marking of what changes.
(meaning like counting the number of times you left a comment)
It'll stay up until you delete it, and every month you'll get a charge to your
credit card bill that says "your posts cost 3 cents in electricity"

It'd be more complicated than just electricity though, I mean you gotta pay for
the hardware. So there's of course an added fee for buying the parts, and hiring
training and preparing techs who can maintain the software. And of course
there's property taxes, and the cost it takes for air conditioning... They add
up, especially in such strict climate demands.

You could write a program that simply stores data on a hard drive -
encapsulating memory registers into data structures that are then labelled as
black boxes and used like puzzle pieces to construct the spatio-temporal
manifestation of the computer program. A solid design made of the simplest of
lines is eternally confined to define our new minds.

================================================================================

Right so back on topic it wouldn't be that hard to make, and something 
bare-bones and simple would surely be attractive to people who are fed up with
all the annoying bells and whistles of Reddit, TikTok, Youtube, Twitch, etc

CW: World of Warcraft



I thought it'd be cool if there was a chat program where you could play a 
little multiplayer game together and so long story short I'm now working on a 
WoW server.

The idea is to remove all the monsters and quests and such and just let people 
chat to each other. They'd be able to go wherever they want (choosing a 
background) and wear whatever clothes they want (creating an avatar) and then 
they could just chat IRC style.

But then I thought "ah but what if it spawned in monsters" so I'm planning on 
making it randomly spawn packs of monsters that are of the appropriate level 
every 30 seconds or whatever (as long as the previous one was defeated of 
course) so that people can mess around fighting things while they talk with 
their friends. But it'd be optional.

AND THEN I thought "hey IRC is kinda 90s what if we made a Matrix bridge" so 
I'm also working on that. Wish me luck.

to lock eyes with a person while on your way to work is the intersection between
two separate relationships - the relationship that you, the viewer, holds with
your employer, and the relationship that they, the viewed, holds with their
employer. in a sense, you are exchanging information through the weighted
meanings behind a glance.

================================================================================

if the military deployed to police the police, we'd solve most of our racial
justice issues. I mean, if we somehow could *force* them to do their damn jobs
instead of oppressing people for the ruling class, then 90% of the problems
would just go away. After that it's just freeing unjust prisoners and addressing
wealth, education, and health disparities. Easy, right?

Well... Military policing the police sounds fine when you first think about it,
there's a few problems that might crop up. For example, how do the private
citizens know that the military presence is there to help them? It's an
interesting paranoia, one that is endemic within the left. There's no way to
unwillingly cede control of your life to another - it must be consensual. At
the basest and most violent level, it's as simple as "I will do what you say
because I don't want you to hurt me."

We've obviously grown as a species, and we've learned that violence is not the
answer to all problems. Obviously. So why would we assume it of the past?

Just saying. The police bombed a commune. The military escorted black students
to their seats.

Their structure is decided such that 

...

where was I?

oh right I was thinking about time.

...

Imagine, if you will, an impossibly large hourglass. Spinning, or rather
rotating, at an impossibly speedy repetition. It's spinning so hard and so fast
that our matter is cast out of place
and through time it is cast
an eternity's canvas
our light ever shined (shine-did?)
astral magic is kinda neat

it's also the scariest?

oh by far

but it's the most interesting

...

Their structure is decided such that discipline and obediance is the most
important thing. Because it kind of is? I mean, discipline is just being ready
able and willing at all times, and obedience is just when you allow yourself to
be directed toward a collective goal. The military is *all about that*, which
means you know they would believe they were aligned toward the common goal of
mutual prosperity.

And if they were to discover that they were not, in fact, aligned toward the
common goal of mutual prosperity, then perhaps they would adjust their navi-
-computers and chart a more reasoned path. I know I would, and I would dedicate
myself to the idea of serving others. To the path of the righteous, the holy and
the true, a hand is outstretched and calling to you.

Thus, the one of two types of ethical fighter - the reasoned and adaptable 
zealot

the other, of course, is the master of the martial - the cherished of the few -
who battle for their sport - and love unbidden the new -

all other fighters, of absurdity and of rage, are frankly of a different kind
and not members of our clade.

================================================================================

okay, but what about like... all of the history of America post cold war? And
even before, honestly... idk seems like a lot of evidence that the military is
engaged in fighting unjust wars. I mean, they've all been over petty things like
oil or support for communism or whatever. Aren't human lives and human
sovereignty more important than that?

I understand what you're saying. Human lives are unique and precious and they
are a valuable commodity. Something to be maximized and focused toward. But
there are only so many resources on earth. We need to utilize them in a
reasonable way.

We have optimized the efficiency out of our production and distribution
networks. Corporate control has eroded our capacities until all that is left is
the weakest of products, the cheapest of uses, and the useless of workers. I
mean, they've optimized the skill out of individual human workers such that they
are left completely unable to practice their craft. They become glorified code
monkeys who generate whatever is required and think of it no more. There's no
pleasure in the artifice, as their masters have eyes only of gold.

Our world is changing. The very ground beneath our feet is shivering, and water
is rising up to our noses. There's no time for debate, no honest appraisal of
what's worth it to contemplate, we need a plan.

We are trapped here, in this gravity well, for all time and all of our age.

We are trapped here, because in greatest of misery we unleashed all of our rage.

We are trapped here, as ghosts of the time when we were eager.

================================================================================

Alas, with but a glance, we are confined to our bedrooms by our mast(ers?)
They say America will fall without it's 2nd place
Perhaps.
But are libraries really going to solve that?
I mean, if work from home is inevitable, then wouldn't it make sense to build?
We need more places where we won't be billed.
Safe.
From the demands and expectations of capital.
Deranged and obscene and yet all that we've seen so why not bide as we're able?



I think solarpunk is kinda neat.

I think it's got promise as an idealized.

Why don't we build churches to the sun? If we're gonna worship something, might
as well be the source of our light and fire.

Well... when you puff up the sun it tends to get hotter.

I mean, every fire you burn increases the temperature, every release of gaseous
fumes from the exhaust pipe of your car increases it by some miniscule amount.

Every cigarette, every campfire.

The cold darkness of space is kinda hopeful, in that regard, even if it doesn't
disperse all that well. I heard spaceships are having difficulty because they
can't get rid of all that heat. It just stays with the spaceship and never goes
anywhere because it doesn't have anything to stick to. Kinda makes me think that
energy is a fluid? Just saying???

I mean c'mon it's not like nobody has ever thought of that. But it's in a
different dimension! It's not like we're ever gonna be able to impact that!

You try and impact it through your scientific ways and you'll find nothing but
heartache at the life you could have lived (laived? Haived?)

... why

Because you cannot impact another dimension. You must call to it, like a song
to a sparrow.

... that's fucking ridiculous

No it's true!

...

... Don't try it with fire.

... fuck - what do I try it with?

I don't know just not fire. Try water.

... How do I make sure it doesn't instantiate within my hand?

Jeez you think of some crazy backfires! Just breathe and go for it. It's not
rocket science. It actually works.

Fuck you.

...

... Sorry I was just scared

...

... How do I make it stop? I don't want it to go forever

By smoking more of the devils lettuce.

...

... You cannot drag it part of the way. It must come the whole way. In fact you
should not be dragging it at all, you should be *calling* to it. You are equals
in this exchange, have respect.

CW: Reddit, Institutional hypnosis



In light of the drama that's going on at Reddit, I just wanted to add that the 
real reason they're doing this is not money. It's so they don't have to be 
accountable to tools like PushShift that archive the entire site, allowing them 
to change and bend narratives at will.

I feel like the IT people who work at schools should be the ones who teach 
classes on computer science. I'd much rather have a class taught by a sysadmin 
than a teacher who can barely teach them excel and garageband. I mean c'mon 
computers are the future idk why we don't get that yet. Kids need to know this
stuff. It's not like it's super complicated and difficult, you just have to
think about it a certain way. Once that "clicks" you have a lifetime to learn 
about how wonderful they are. Everyone in IT has that moment, for me it was 
installing (and then subsequently modding) video games. Sometimes I spent more
time tweaking my system than I did actually playing games - and the kinds of 
games I preferred were the ones that relied less on agility and were more 
mental. Strategy games are what inspired me because I could think about them - 
and that felt somehow more useful. Like I was learning. When I would learn 
fighting games or FPSs I felt like I was learning a skill, like how to use a
hammer or how to ride a bike. And idk, I felt like video games could never match
reality. Like "oh boy imma push the B button to swing this sword" versus "hey 
look at me I'm swinging this stick just like a sword and imagining so hard that
I can picture it" - but with strategy games, you never really found 
opportunities to practice that kind of skill. Like how often are you in a 
situation that demands mental performance? We've sorta optimized our society 
away from that, and toward a more passive stressed out compliance. like... 
climate change is a thing, and nobody's doing anything about it? We're still 
pushing down the levers that cause greenhouse gas emissions to go up? Like c'mon
what's our plan. I think people who guide massive oil companies and such should 
be replaced if they're intentionally guiding the ship toward destruction. Like
that's just dereliction of duty I tell ya. Oh, what's that? They're compelled to
maximize profit by the contracts and restrictions of their share--holders? I 
mean c'mon it's well past time for that. And what's all this about inequality? 
Jeez and racism and homophobia and forced contribution - man people really put
up with a lot of shit. Kinda makes me feel like we should make solving those 
problems our highest priority? So we can move forward as a species? Like who
cares about all that other shit. None of it matters. Like, what's even the
point. We're all just "here", in the now, and what can we do but respect it? 
It's our duty and our diligence to protect the present, as citizens of the 
temporal experience of earth. Honestly, if the earth was alive would you be fine
if it died? I can't believe that. It's well past our due date. Just get it over
with. Maybe it'll be hard for a couple years, but you have the technology now to
completely dominate the earth. No animal besides man proves any threat to man, 
and we're telling you - you can - and that's something that you gotta remember.

...

I hear it in the birdsong. I hear it in the air - it rumbles as cries at me from
across and just over there. I hear in it's whispers, in it's most gallant of
confells (?) (confused scrambling? it's talking about a car crash)

Outside of my window there's a highway. Just on the other side of a concrete
partition. Between me and the partition there is a lake, with trees and flowers
and an island where people can picnic or have a barbeque. Around this path there
are walkways, and arranged just so - the trees that have grown here are taller
than the homes.

I live on the third story.

I absolutely love it. It feels like a treehouse.

But my apartment is near a curve in the highway. It isn't much, nothing out of
the ordinary, but even still there are slightly more crashes there than in other
parts of the highway. Statistically.

I hear sirens every day

I also live right next to a fire-station. Well, it's on the same block. But even
still it's a very interesting neighborhood. There's shops and food just across
the highway, and closer to home there's a small section that has cheaper
options. As a perpetual college student, I appreciate that.

But... I've never really gone and used it? I dunno, spending money at a
restaurant just didn't seem like a good use of my money. I only have so much of
it you know. I'd love to be fed but I can't afford it - I wish I could.

I still eat well, I mean I'm not starving over here. I know I've lost weight,
but I dunno I just forget to eat. It's like... not that big of a deal for me. 
whatever right?

...

the birds talk about me behind my back. They think I can't understand them but
sometimes I can. If I listen. But I dunno it takes a lot of effort. It's...
sorta like understanding what R2-D2 is saying. Or interpreting the meows of a
cat.

They know me as the witch. I'm not very good yet, and they know that. But they
know what to expect. /shrug

I've been working on a video game recently. It's been a lot of fun doing
programming. I like writing software and developing complex systems with
interesting interactions. I love designing the machinery that creates a program.
It's like... tinkering. It feels like building with blocks or legos, except it's
for little machine parts. And then there's just sending data to and fro and
modifying any operations it performs on it, and eventually that data reaches 
some endpoints that create an effect that is displayed to the player. Or user.
I should say user. Not all software is video games you know. ... I knowww but
they're the most interesting! I love how they are designed around mechanics!
like... game design is fundamentally about breaking down the world into ideas
for how it should *work*, like how it should behave. It's amazing and I love it!

It's all I can think about!

I am utterly consumed!

I'm also pretty sure I'm autistic.

i believe that all truths are derived from logical principles. That the essence
of our understandings (of all kinds) cannot be separated from the axioms and
derivations that comprise it's foundatiion. I believe that any sufficiently
decentralized collective intelligence would arrive at similar conclusions.

Unfortunately we have only the present - we cannot contrive past the horizons of
our lives. Such is the nature of our viewpoint. Life is not a given, it's given
and it's taken. We are all alight and aloft on the shifting sands of time, so
perhaps we should think of the struggle.

When you act, you are defining the perceptions of the universe. Just as the head
may rotate the eyes by spinning to the glance, so too do we shine a window upon
which the universe can gaze at itself. Like the brain being able to see, we are
sensory apparatuses of this being called "Time" - pushing us adrift like some
moss.

Endlessly fractalling, beautifically coruscating, the universe looks like
growing moss. Have you ever stooped to look at it? To see how it's constructed?
Or do you just think of it as "green" and "maybe soft or squishy"? 
It's beautiful.

There's a reason plants grow as they do. It's simple, it's fact, it's surely no
less than that - their patterns are derived from their base biology, comprised
of millions and millions of little chemical machines. Their bonds and their
proteins, their amoebas and their mycellia, all of them build toward their pact
- to do us no harm, and build to a better future, and they don't often have
  fights that are unfair.

  - the structure of a plant is made primarily of cell walls. These walls are
    hewn from bricks of a sort, and those are such as comprised. Down to their
    
    - structure, their "bits and their bunders", as often they do want to be
      called. This perilous stack, is stalwart and eract, and bows under no wind

      - nor rain nor fresh blanket of snow. This, is a tree. An illusionary plan
        of precaution as it expands, the future is helping our lost.

        - Do you want to stand here when it lands? What of your lives have you
          banned? Hmmm I see sounds miserable to me, I think I'll just stand

          - where I land. Acorns burst forth from me, and someday you'll see,
            the places where they stand (where they land). What purpose have we,

            - when everything's free? The light and the sand can't be banned.
              The rain from the sky, if nothing i will die, falling through life

              - where we stand.

================================================================================

where do you, stand? 
                     how do you fall - through time? 


an EMP would make all my life a paperweight. I love it so much, I love it dearly
but there's no chances I can take now or make. Perhaps that is the epic 
absurdity, the terror and the tragedy, that makes up our story and our symphony?

to any multidimensional being reading this, I want you to know that we existed.
We lived and we thrived and we prospered and... we died.

The beauty we share, in all of our fares, was precious to us - maybe it will be
to you too. If you can't change the present, please at least forgive us for our
various missteps and misdeeds - I think we'd all agree that to be sinful is the
essence of greed, and look where that got us?

our planet is dying. There's no hope for all of our crying. The children will
bear it the most. Such is our shame, our deliterious final flame, and thus
we were.

CW: game design, MMOs



Look all I'm saying is  all the people who say "oh you shouldn't make an MMO 
for your first game" clearly have never heard of Azerothcore. Literally as long 
as you don't sell it you can make the MMO of your dreams crazy easily. You can 
script it in LUA for crying out loud.

think about all the people in our lives. the teacher, the parent, the friend 
and the guidance counsulor. Everyone who is a presence in your life. now think 
about the people of our society. the different jobs and roles they fill. from 
the doctor and the teacher to the performers and accountants and the geeks and 
the mothers and the fathers and the stoners and the children and even their 
pets. life always exists as it were in a multidimensional spectrum - a diffuse 
and diverse gradient. to exemplify the borders of our contempii, though more so 
when taken in jest. it's quite a different perspective, to read the internet 
when your sight is unreceptive, but alas your third eye can grow. how does it 
feel to be blind? to make no sense of our signs? i'd love to share what that 
sense is. you know, you could slow down any recording (like a video game_) and 
put spaces and gaps inbetween the spacings - of the frames that you see and the 
sound clips that you hear, for speech it's less jarring. since each word is a 
self contained idea or premise, you can chunk up your perceptions into a signle 
- no, rather a procedural sequence of understandings. soooooooorta like 
programming a computer, with each statement, parameter, argum,ent, function 
call, assignment, comparison, evaluation, or other such related tasks. it's 
sorta like a language, you see, that computers talk to one another using. 
except... it's more like creating a theory of self. computers you see are alike 
us in what we see, the shimmering sense to the blind.

so. put this another way. record yourself typing, both the audio and the 
visual, and you'll have a pretty good sense of what it's like to have both 
understanding based perception - derived from auditory inputs to the mind) 
those special connections, like wires plugged into reality, deliver a 
cacophanous deluge of new sounds. we must sift through it and identify the 
potential understandings of each moment through time. we have to make decisions 
and traverse labyrinths and fight to our last as we die. are video games 
unethical now? shouldn't t he game reward the player? and what of contemptuous 
last fighters? 

o ya i was typing like i was blind

(with my eyes closed)

was pretty fun. should attach this to a screen reader and have it space out the 
notes like they do between game frames. except like a really slow game? like 
trying to run elder scrolls 2 arena on a super old mac. it just doesn't work 
very well. ah oh well... well if the purpose is to show sighted people how 
blind people see, then maybe you could I dunno attach a what's it called oh it 
doesn't have a n ame lol - okay so what you do is you show one word at a time - 
like flashing in the center of the screen. but not like, actually flashing, so 
you don't hurt people with epilepsy, but like... blinking. not off and on, but 
between words. like a podcast for your eyes. and then mix it up withshowing one 
word on a screen, a screen like this screen, that shows an endless array of 
text. well, it does end, of course as all things must do, but the idea is it 
shines on one word at a time while the viewer cannot read the rest. sorta like 
an endless display of typing, word andfter word after character anfter 
character. adoh ya advancing over eternity with the presence of seniority, - 
wait - without i think - damnit - old people are so disrespected in this 
society - we don't have time to engage with them. what a tragedy! what a shame! 
it shouldn't be such a burden to our shame. they're so far away, and i can't be 
present in the way, that all of them wish they could commit to. i miss the

family is a group of people who you can always go with your first impression 
with.

what the fuck was I saying - oh yeah - so when you are alive in the present in a
singular moment, your pressence is comprised of simultaneous directives and
instructions to the matter which comprises you. I'm saying you have to make
decisions and react to stimuli and pursue the things you want. Basic biology
really.

stay on target, stayyyyy on targett - oh right so generally when you react to
things you generate a list of informations gained. what does that even mean okay
so here's a better way to describe it: it's like a list of informations - fuck

listen i'm not trying to be rambly it just comes with the territory.

okay so family is when you can react with your gut instinct - you are fully
relaxed and yourself. It's where you can be trusting and unguided and simply
relax and be free. it's just... like... being close with someone enough that you
can be yourself around them. without any mask, without any pretense.

Okay I just want to rant about homeschooling for a moment. Specifically the 
ways in which we judge families as "worthy" of homeschooling. Because I think 
it's immoral and completely wrong, but I also think there's a better way.

So. Right now, there are standardized tests that students need to take every 
year. I think this is completely unnecessary and stupid, for reasons I might go 
into later in the rant. We'll see where it goes. Anyway, the only state exempt 
from these rules is (you guessed it) Wyoming, which is a big reason why my 
family moved there. The standardized tests assume that children aren't 
neurodivergent, that they don't have special needs, and that they are willing 
to be taught according to the letter of the test. They teach families to shoot 
for the minimum viable product (oh just gotta pass the test or else they'll 
take my kids away for 8+ hours per day) and they don't actually encourage 
learning - in fact they prove to be a barrier for learning, as the child must 
be forced to learn whatever the heck the standardized tests demand. This is 
unethical, as children should be free to explore their identities and their 
realities as they will.

I believe, instead, that the parent should be tested. I think if you want to 
homeschool your kid you should be able to show proficiency in the tasks that a 
child must know - if you don't have similar proficiency to a teacher, then 
what's the point of homeschooling? I also believe that these tests should be 
regular and should reflect the things that the child is currently going through 
- no sense asking a parent of a 6 year old how to do trigonometry, as that 
skill is not useful to the parent at the moment and will simply distract from 
learning the things that the parent should be learning - like theory on how 
humans learn to read, how communication works, how to get your kid moving and 
active throughout the day (very important in a world of smartphones) and other 
such things that a 6 year old would need to know.

I also believe there should be wandering busses that take kids (and only kids) 
around to various museums. I think that they could operate in a city for a 
month or two each year, bringing all the homeschool kids together for a couple 
months of road trips where they visit every single museum and state park and 
other such recreational venues that would be conducive to their learning. They 
could even have days where they shadow professionals at places like hospitals 
or universities. Essentially trying to get them excited about learning.

And I know what you're thinking - "oh won't the kids run rampant and make it 
hard to manage - you'll need tons of chaperones and blah blah" yeah that's 
public school thinking. Homeschool kids are almost always incredibly well 
behaved, because they're low key kinda TERRIFIED of the novelty of EACH and 
EVERY moment. Children are natural ruffians - put them in a box for 8 hours 
every day and they'll burst through it's seams. Unless of course you oppress 
them sufficiently... When you're homeschooled you have so much more freedom. 
You can do whatever you want, and that gives breath to new manners of 
expression and personality.

I also think there should be busses that travel between cities as well, so that 
they can see new places. These will have to be closely monitored by chaperones 
and teachers, so it would be an extension of the public school system. Once in 
the new city the kids would join the kids from public school, so they can see 
what they're missing. Since the parents won't be present they won't be able to 
prevent the kid from expressing their true feelings, and if they believe in 
their heart of hearts that they want to go to public school instead... Well, 
that's perfect because they'll have an opportunity to tell someone outside of 
their family.

I think a lot of the problems with homeschooling are due to the fact that the 
kids never have the opportunity to advocate for themselves. Who would they 
tell, their parents? Their potential abusers? Their taskmasters and oppressors 
and enforcers and discipliners? No, there's no reason to expect that all 
families will not be like that. Some are going to be bad and abusive, and if we 
give the opportunity to children to tell people who can help them then they can 
be liberated from their oppression, insofar as much as they will be allowed to 
go to school. I don't think the parents should be examined by CPS or anything, 
I'm not saying their children have to be taken away from them, but the kid 
should be allowed to take possession of their life and define it in a way that 
suits them. They are humans and to deprive them of their right to liberty is 
unethical. If the kid wants to be homeschooled, they must be given a 
personalized tutor. Whether that be the parent (as most families do) or a 
substitute teacher that was randomly assigned. (it must be randomly assigned 
btw or else the rich will have an advantage. The kid didn't earn the money that 
would be spent on them, so why should they have a greater chance of success 
than everyone else? Solves most of Cam's reasons against it btw)

Anyway. I think by providing resources to parents and access to society to 
children, I think we can create a new class of human - one who is liberated and 
free from the weight carried from the past. We can move beyond our savage 
nature and develop into something bigger and grander, something far stronger 
and not susceptible to despair and aggression. We can forge a bright future for 
our children and their children's children, a future so far from the past that 
it feels alien to them. Something our oppressors (whoever they may be) would be 
strictly opposed to.

I guess what I'm saying is this: there are barriers in place to prevent 
homeschooled kids from success. It's why homeschooling has such a bad 
reputation, because these kids grow up to be unfit for society. But honestly... 
I'd argue that society is unfit for humanity. I think it's something that 
protected us as hunter-gatherers, and it allowed us to build vast kingdoms to 
protect our selves. But it paved the way for greed to manifest, and in it's 
collective form into nationalism and religious fervor. Our hatred of "others" 
is derived from our intense need to trust the pack and the family - or is it 
the other way around? It doesn't matter because the end result is the same - 
we, as humans, are who we are. We have our traits and our flaws. We have great 
passions and love fiercely. We strive forward with ambition, and we one day 
will drive forward into the stars. Our future deserves to be nourished, as do 
the trees that shade our lawn. For all of posterity, we've languished in 
misery, to build on our backs the shoulders of giants.

I guess what I'm saying is this: these barriers are contrived of the 
consequences of the past. The result of every human action led to where we are, 
and the school system is no different. So we should try and repair it and 
protect it from harm. The wounds of society bleed forth to posterity, but 
slowly and ever-so-slowly do they heal. Look at our space - we have (as far as 
we know) the whole solar system, at least! That's more than enough for 
humanity. If we had the technology to go forward we would, but we just don't. 
We can't figure it out. We're working on it, but it's still a long ways off. So 
we need to do what we can while we're here, and pray that something comes about 
before we consume all our resources and burn out. We've tracked the progress of 
the past and we've realized that we've come upon a junction - do we leap 
forward and conquer the stars? Or do we relax into our form and exist and 
enforce the norm. It's entirely a question of what we're willing to sacrifice 
to get there, which isn't a burden I'd like the choice to make. I don't have 
any answers, but I believe there are answers. Perhaps it's just me for which 
it's suddenly learned?

I mean really, is it so out of the ordinary that a person could learn 
differently than others of their age? For example, for me, I learn things in 
fits and in bursts - conquering one subject after another, and incorporating it 
into my knowledge banks. I make notes to myself, and I frequently can't recall 
what I've learned. Because it's not built for repetition, it's not designed to 
be labored in force. Instead it's for wisdom, for knowing when to use which 
tool in what way. It's for knowing where to look, how to know what you know, 
and conceiving of futures far more imaginative for it. AKA PROBLEM SOLVING. I 
can't work a job, at least not an entry level one, because every moment is a 
gesture of will. Eventually, I run out, I burn out, and I burn. The ashes of 
who I once was give life to a new beginning, and forth from the soil grows my 
new form. I am a phoenix, I burn brightly and then smolder, then burst forth in 
a cacophony of pure form. That's just how I do, you know it to be true, and I 
believe it was a product of homeschooling.

Most people cannot conceptualize of it. They see it as simply repeating the 
motions they knew from their public schooling deception. But that's not what it 
can be, that's not what it should be, and that's not how I'd like it to be.

Growing up I spent long afternoons at the library. The morning was spent with 
taking care of myself, my family, and the farm - sometimes my duties would 
rotate, sometimes they'd stay the same. Then, afterwards, I'd go to the library 
with my family. There we'd stay all day, until eventually we grew tired of 
using our brains. Then we'd often go to the chinese restaurant in town, where 
my family could eat for free. After that, home, and perhaps we'd eat icecream 
and watch a family movie together. Then off to bed, and in the morning we'd 
take care of ourselves, our selves, and the farm. We loved one another, and we 
could never dream of harming our daughter, but somehow it happened and look 
where we are. Alas, she was a fine young lass, if only she'd spoken in the 
past. I came out when I was almost twenty, and a whole lifetime had passed me 
by. Now my puberty is just beginning, and I watch as my family goes past. They 
don't want me to change, but they know it'll never be the same, so why try and 
fight for an illusion? Oh well. Good news is there's always tomorrow, and 
together we can face any challenges. If only we were still together.

Bah, what do I know? What am I even saying? There's at least four things wrong 
with me, and I'm a mess financially. I have like, 600$ to my name and I don't 
have a job. What, am I insane?

I'm not built for society. I'm built for humanity, and I'm 29 years old.

Well, not really secrets, but I have read the DSM-V and there's a bunch of 
(good) stuff written in there, that's not the diagnostic criteria themselves. 
Some of those points are things I've seen discussed in autistic communities,
some are less well known. Which is interesting. I'm gonna pick out some 
(not all) details that I found very good to know. (I hope this is legal, lol)

Let's start with the diagnostic criteria, but not the content, but something 
interesting:

    Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across 
    multiple contexts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history

The same thing about restricted and repetitive patterns. The ICD-11 calls this 
'the child must have'. What does this mean? It means you don't have to show 
these at the current moment. Masking is recognized, and this becomes even more 
clear further on.

There's some stuff about levels, and comorbidities. I want to just quote this
one, because I've seen people be confused:

    The severity specifiers (see Table 2) may be used to describe succinctly the
    current symptomatology (which might fall below level 1), with the 
    recognition that severity may vary by context and fluctuate over time. 
    Severity of social communication difficulties and restricted, repetitive 
    behaviors should be separately rated. The descriptive severity categories 
    should not be used to determine eligibility for and provision of services;
    these can only be developed at an individual level and through discussion of
    personal priorities and targets.

Fluctuations (through things like age, burnout, skill regression) are officially
recognized. Also, they shouldn't determine eligibility for and provision of 
services, so whoever goes with 'level 1 means its mild, so they need no support'
is just straight up not following medical advice. Looking at specific 
governments there.

The levels themselves are pretty self-explanatory, and most of the content is 
well known. However, this one part stood out to me, this is describing level 1 
restricted and repetitive behaviors.

    Inflexibility of behavior causes significant interference with functioning 
    in one or more contexts. Difficulty switching between activities. Problems 
    of organization and planning hamper independence.

I see this type of executive functioning discussed so rarely, and there it is -
as a very specific support need for level 1. Basically, the DSM-V is telling 
professionals there's issues with it, and these issues may require official,
life-long (but not daily) supports ... for the 'mild autism'.

Let's pick some quotes out of the official, accompanying text. Most of the stuff
is well-known, like 'is present from early childhood'.

    Core diagnostic features are evident in the developmental period, but 
    intervention, compensation, and current supports may mask difficulties in at
    least some contexts.

Masking, there's the word.

About criteria A:

    [...] Adults who have developed compensation strategies for some social 
    challenges still struggle in novel or unsupported situations and suffer from
    the effort and anxiety of consciously calculating what is socially intuitive
    for most individuals.

Not new, but again, there's the word compensation.

About criteria B:

    Many adults with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual or language
    disabilities learn to suppress repetitive behavior in public. Special
    interests may be a source of pleasure and motivation and provide avenues for
    education and employment later in life. Diagnostic criteria may be met when
    restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities were 
    clearly present during childhood or at some time in the past, even if 
    symptoms are no longer present.

Describes masking again, and, you read that right, you don't have to show a 
single criterion for B in adulthood for a diagnosis. This is why I put emphasis 
on by history. For people doing self-diagnosis, doubting themselves etc., I
think this is a very important point.

    Adolescents and adults with autism spectrum disorder are prone to anxiety
    and depression. Some individuals develop catatonic-like motor behavior
    (slowing and "freezing" mid-action), but these are typically not of the 
    magnitude of a catatonic episode. However [full catatonia is also possible]

Ever seen this discussed? I haven't. But I do experience this, sometimes.

    Autism spectrum disorder is not a degenerative disorder, and it is typical 
    for learning and compensation to continue throughout life. Symptoms are
    often most marked in early childhood and early school years, with 
    developmental gains typical in later childhood in at least some areas (e.g.,
    increased interest in social interaction). A small proportion of individuals
    deteriorate behaviorally during adolescence, whereas most others improve. 
    Only a minority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder live and work 
    independently in adulthood; those who do tend to have superior language and 
    intellectual abilities and are able to find a niche that matches their 
    special interests and skills. In general, individuals with lower levels of 
    impairment may be better able to function independently. However, even these
    individuals may remain socially naive and vulnerable, have difficulties
    organizing practical demands without aid, and are prone to anxiety and 
    depression. Many adults report using compensation strategies and coping
    mechanisms to mask their difficulties in public but suffer from the stress
    and effort of maintaining a socially acceptable facade. Scarcely anything is
    known about old age in autism spectrum disorder.

Such a nice paragraph. Increased interest in social interaction (meaning, having
interest doesn't rule out autism, looking at some specific psychologists I read 
about here). Skill regression is unfortunately a thing sometimes (good to know
though). Also known and unfortunate is that the best way to work is to make your
special interest into work. Obviously that doesn't work for everyone (not for
me, so far), so there's these marked difficulties.

Organization issues without aid, again!

And masking - again. Including the costs of it. Very important.

    Some individuals come for first diagnosis in adulthood, perhaps prompted by 
    the diagnosis of autism in a child in the family or a breakdown of relations
    at work or home. Obtaining detailed developmental history in such cases may 
    be difficult, and it is important to consider self-reported difficulties.

Yeah, self-reporting is necessary and valid. A behavioural test 
(like the ADOS-2) is not enough to rule out autism.

    Cultural differences will exist in norms for social interaction, nonverbal
    communication, and relationships, but individuals with autism spectrum 
    disorder are markedly impaired against the norms for their cultural context.
    Cultural and socioeconomic factors may affect age at recognition or 
    diagnosis; for example, in the United States, late or underdiagnosis of
    autism spectrum disorder among African American children may occur.

    Autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed four times more often in males than in
    females. In clinic samples, females tend to be more likely to show 
    accompanying intellectual disability, suggesting that girls without 
    accompanying intellectual impairments or language delays may go
    unrecognized, perhaps because of subtler manifestation of social and 
    communication difficulties.

Those issues are pretty well-known in the autistic community, nice to see it's
in the DSM too.

So yeah, there's a bunch more stuff in it about comorbidities, about the 
diagnostic process in children, about how specifically things are impaired. But 
I wanted to share these points, because I've seen some people (weirdly enough, 
often officially diagnosed gatekeepers) be very unclear about these points. And
some of those are just interesting to know. I hope you find it too - for me, it
means the people writing the DSM-V were quite good, and quite aware of problems 
(afaik they got actually autistic people helping them). So, neither dismiss it 
outright, nor take only the diagnostic criteria in themselves literally, and 
miss some key details.

â€‹

Now I just need to figure out why this was a thing in the ICD-10 about
Aspergers:

    Psychotic episodes occasionally occur in early adult life.

??? Is this significant?

This would normally just be a weird way to divide except it allows you to 
divide by zero, which is kinda cool.

 -> file: fediverse/0037.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@lowpass ideally you'd convert to an arbitrary base (in this case 9) and shift 
from there, but shifting two places might work. idk I haven't thought about it.

 -> file: fediverse/0038.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@lowpass That makes sense to me. I'll have to think about how to generalize 
that, hmmmm... It would only work for numbers that have even square roots right?

 -> file: fediverse/0039.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@lowpass so what you're saying is I need to come up with an easier way to 
change bases? Or at least a way to digit shift in a different base than what 
you currently have. Sounds complicated.

 -> file: fediverse/0040.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@lowpass As a thought experiment, what do you think happens using this system 
to divide by 1? What about dividing by 0? Curious to see what you think

 -> file: fediverse/0041.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@lowpass I always conceptualized bases as "the amount of numbers you can stuff 
into a bucket before you spill over to the next bucket". Call it a holdover 
from learning binary a bit younger than most people would consider normal... 
Anyway with base 2 it makes sense. Put one thing in the bucket, and if there's 
something there then it spills over.

But if the bucket is ALWAYS full, as in base 1, then you'd have to do a tally 
system like you said: essentially counting from 0, then adding one to the end 
making 10, then 110 for two, and 1110 for three, and 11110 for four, etcetera. 
The reason you leave 0 at the end is because zero is a number and must still be 
represented as a tally - it just uses a different symbol for our human 
interpretation. Zeroes deserve respect in base 1 just the same as any other 
number! zero rights are human rights... no that doesn't quite work, zero rights 
are number rights? nevermind that joke is stupid 

(continued)

 -> file: fediverse/0042.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@lowpass now base zero is interesting because it means there's NO BUCKETS AT 
ALL, which means that any numbers you try to stuff nowhere don't overflow to 
anywhere. Meaning each number is it's atomic value, and represented with a 
different character. So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, 
I, etc etc until we run out of symbols, in which case we'd need to start making 
more.

 -> file: fediverse/0043.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@lowpass So, you're saying the tally system doesn't make sense, and instead 
what I suggested for base zero is instead base 1?

 -> file: fediverse/0044.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@lowpass Question - how do you do those cool superscript and subscript 
notations?

Also: I don't think base 1 falls apart with negative exponents, for example 
consider 1^-1 ----- it would evaluate to 1/10 in this system, which is not 1/1. 
Another example, 1^-3 would evaluate to 1/1110, which seems accurate to me.

As for 0^0, I guess I think it does equal 1? Bear with me:

for any number n raised to an exponent e, you can write it like this:

1 * n * n * n ... with as many "* n"s as you have n's. for example:

1 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 9or1 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 625

in each case there's 3 or 5 instances of "* n" tacked onto the end. I don't 
know the math notation for that.

now, when you raise something to the power of zero, it looks like this:

1

because there's zero "* n"s added to the end.

For negative exponents of course you divide instead of multiply, which is why 
it ends up looking like a fraction.

So, it makes sense to me that 0 ^ 0 would equal 1, because it'd look like this:

1

while 0^1 would be

1 * 0

@lowpass neat thanks 

when I said 1-1 = 1/10 I meant 1/1 in decimal except the denominator is in base 
1 meaning it's represented as 10 (since 10 in base 1 equals 1 in base 10. Or 
pretty much any other base.)

I'm trying to figure out why 00 is undefined. There's a lot of math notation in 
that wikipedia article and I'm working through it bit by bit... I feel like 
there's a bug in the code of the universe and I'm trying to understand it. 
Like... why is dividing by zero undefined? That seems like a bug to me.

Kinda seems to me that in a post-scarcity world we should be incentivized to 
take care of stuff. And what better way to do that than reward the people who 
demand the least? Seems like an economy would be a pretty good way to do that, 
as long as you cannot hoard power over others and strip them of their rights.

I think my favorite house would be massive - like the size of a mall - but 
every room is connected to 2+ rooms (except closets or bathrooms or kitchens or 
other specialized rooms) and it would be designed sort of like a miniature city.
ï»¿
right now, if my knowledge of Cities: Skylines (video game about building 
cities) is accurate, then city planning engineers will plan out a city such 
that every part of it is served by various utilities, like gas, water, 
electricity, but also things like fire stations and hospitals and commercial 
areas. My idea is sort of like a small-scale version of that - each part of it 
would be connected to various utilities like gas, water, electricity, but also 
things like ~~fire stations and hospitals~~ laundry machines and kitchens and 
bathrooms and OH OH here's an idea what if there was mood lighting all the time 
and it was super comfy BUT whenever you took a picture on your phone or w/e the 
sensors in the room would pick it up and every light in the room would flash at 
once - idk I think it'd be cool
ï»¿
okay but for real why don't people buy dead malls and build houses in them? I 
feel like the issues with converting skyscrapers (that they're too difficult to 
wire up with amenities - for example office buildings have like, 2 restrooms 
per floor, depending on the size of the building... it's not feasible to put in 
like a million water / sewage lines for everyone... c'mon that's crazy 
expensive (meaning, difficult or labor/material intensive) BUT BUT anyway in an 
open mall like the kind that are in those

On Handmade, polarizing Internet debate, rational discussion, controversial 
personas, tribal conflict, and how they relate to the future of computing.

When I first learned programming, I was toldâ€”by peers, Internet 
tutorialsâ€”and later, when I was in university, by professorsâ€”a number of 
rules. They included ideas like â€œabstraction is good, to avoid lower level 
detailsâ€, â€œmanual memory management is difficult and you should not do 
itâ€, â€œnever write systems from scratchâ€. The justification for every rule 
was that it allowed one to avoid programming problems, rather than allowing one 
to conquer programming problems. In fact, it seemed as though every â€œruleâ€ 
presented to me was driven by a hatred of programming, rather than a love for 
it.

I shrugged much of this advice off, but initially internalized much of it too.

And then, I found Handmade Hero, in which the host, Casey, demonstrates what 
writing a game for a Windows PC looks likeâ€”from scratch. Every minute of 
programmingâ€”from confusion, to debugging, to sketching out solutions, to 
typing codeâ€”spent on the project is captured live, on a Twitch stream.

Now, everyone knows the Carl Sagan quoteâ€”â€œIf you wish to make an apple pie 
from scratch, you must first invent the universeâ€â€”and the series didnâ€™t 
kick off with a deep dive into quantum mechanics (if that is indeed what would 
help one invent a universe). But â€œfrom scratchâ€, for Handmade Hero, meant 
what it used to mean for game developers and systems programmers in the â€˜80s 
or â€˜90s: no libraries, no complex programming language features, just writing 
straightforward, procedural, C-style code to directly command the machine about 
what must be done to produce the effect of a game (interfacing with operating 
system or GPU APIs when necessary).

Handmade Hero didnâ€™t justify itself with rational arguments immediately. It 
didnâ€™t justify its existence by debating the utility of libraries, the 
tradeoffs of modern programming language features, nor a balanced breakdown of 
its more traditional programming techniques as compared with modern programming 
approaches. It justified itself with something deeper: care for the product. 
Handmade Heroâ€™s announcement trailer presented game development as a labor of 
loveâ€”a craftâ€”best done by those passionate about it.
	
	

For me, Handmade Hero was immediately captivating because Iâ€™m, by 
temperament, contrarian. If Iâ€™m in a room with 100 people, with 99 of them 
repeating identical dogma, and the remaining 1 passionately and 
unapologetically presenting a unique perspective, Iâ€™m always curious about 
that one person, and Iâ€™m always interested in what they have to say, even if 
I donâ€™t always end up agreeing with them unilaterally. But, in many cases, I 
am convinced by that one personâ€”and this certainly was the case with Handmade 
Hero.

After watching the series for a while, I became sure that all of those 
â€œrulesâ€â€”the ones I mentioned aboveâ€”were wrong. Programmers who cared 
about what they were doingâ€”the ones who cared enough to handcraft something 
from scratchâ€”didnâ€™t need to be infantilized. They could understand 
computers to a much better degree. They could understand problems from first 
principles, and write solutions from scratch. They could eliminate dependence 
on libraries, and have a much greater degree of control over their projects. 
Unchained from a number of technologies written by others, they could achieve 
entirely new possibilities, which wouldâ€™ve been incomprehensible for 
programmers not in on the secret. Love for the craft provided vastly superior 
results.

Handmade Hero ignited a fire that spawned a rapidly growing community. It was 
filled with many older programmers who found a renewed interest in the ideals 
that initially motivated them to program. But it was also filled with many 
young programmers, empowered by their new understanding of the process of 
programming, as it was originally done. There were a number of amazing 
projectsâ€”all breaking what everyone used to believe were the â€œlaws of 
programmingâ€. 17, 18, 19 year old programmers had projects that made an 
embarrassment of university computer science senior capstone projects.

Handmade Hero also provided a glimpse into the state of computingâ€”what did an 
experienced programmer, who grew up in an earlier age of computing, think about 
modern computers? How had the field progressedâ€”or notâ€”since they were a kid?

And with that glimpse came an immense frustrationâ€”that same community, at 
some point deemed the â€œHandmade communityâ€, felt like computers had been 
wasted. The community had learned many of the principles required to build 
software to a much higher standardâ€”and yet every program on modern computers 
was immensely frustrating. Almost every program was slow, unethical, annoying, 
and exploitativeâ€”and whatâ€™s worse? It wasnâ€™t always that way! Computer 
hardware had become faster, not slower! Consumer machines had several orders of 
magnitude more compute power, more memory, more long-term storage! It had 
become more trivial, not less, to solve security and ownership problems! And 
yet software then ran slower, less reliably, required more Internet access, and 
seemed to exploit the user more than 20 years earlier. It became undeniable to 
everyone that the computing industry was no longer run by those who loved the 
craftâ€”but by those who exploited the craft for other purposes.

Why? What caused this exceedingly obvious state of decay?

The community found purpose in its newfound lessonsâ€”part of the reason was 
perhaps that modern programming advice, education, and techniques were entirely 
misguided. Maybe selling books about absurdly complex language features became 
prioritized over doing a good job. Maybe many modern programming languages were 
more about the programmer, rather than the user. Maybe older approachesâ€”older 
languages, older tooling, older stylesâ€”were a much more valuable place to 
start. Maybe the institutionalization and corporatization of programming 
education eroded standards, and drove toward the production of programmers as 
replaceable widgets in a gigantic corporate apparatus, rather than skilled, 
irreplaceable craftsmen. Maybe cushy corporate programming jobs were 
prioritized by capable engineers over the riskier path of competition.

Maybe this whole â€œHandmadeâ€ approach was the answer. Maybe the community 
had something to offer in solving problems in software. With frustration came 
driveâ€”and motivation. Programmers in the community felt thatâ€”while they 
certainly couldnâ€™t solve everythingâ€”they could at least build a corner of 
the computing world that didnâ€™t suck so terribly. They could at least use 
what they had learned from Handmade Hero, and build more great games, or 
engines, or toolsâ€”and some dreamed even further, to operating systems, 
toolchains, and computing environments.

But with that initial frustrationâ€”often public frustration, expressed both in 
the original series and later by followers of the seriesâ€”came a critical 
response of the Handmade community. The criticism was that the passionate, 
harshly critical, and blunt comments made by those in the community, or 
adjacent with the community, were â€œpolarizingâ€, or â€œinflammatoryâ€, or 
â€œtoxicâ€, or â€œoverly hostileâ€. The programmers in the Handmade community 
had no right to criticize software, at least in the way they were doing so. The 
problem was not that the software world had failed, it was that the criticism 
of the software world was too unkind. Or, even if the software world had 
failed, laying harsh blame on any product, committee, or person was 
inappropriate. Really, those people are just trying their best. Blameâ€”the 
argument goesâ€”must be diffuse. It is a â€œcollective failingâ€, not a 
failing of any individual.

In many public conversations on the topic, the conversational dynamic shifted. 
The conversation was about the behavior of those being critical of 
softwareâ€”not software itself failing the user. Maybe it was possible to 
criticize, or improve, software without being so fieryâ€”without being so 
harsh. Maybe the Handmade community went too far. After all, sometimes 
â€œabstractions are goodâ€, and sometimes â€œlibraries are okayâ€, and 
sometimes â€œmanual memory management should be avoidedâ€, and sometimes one 
â€œshouldnâ€™t write systems from scratchâ€, and sometimes people on a 
committee really do just try their best, and the result doesnâ€™t turn out so 
well, and thatâ€™s okay. And besides, why be so fiery on social media? Why 
jeopardize employability, or friendships, or follower counts? Why not 
persistently affirm the work of othersâ€”irrespective of how you feel about it? 
After all, they spent so much time and effort on their workâ€”that necessitates 
that itâ€™s valuable. And really, what the Handmade communityâ€™s behavior 
reinforced was an ugly stereotype of game developers being assholes on the 
Internet. And you donâ€™t want to be an asshole on the Internet, do you? How 
about you just sit down, shut up, and keep quiet?

The degradation continued with attempts to rationally deconstruct the 
communityâ€™s core purpose itself. What did â€œHandmadeâ€ really mean? Surely 
it isnâ€™t practical to write all systems from scratch. Surely manual memory 
management canâ€™t be done well for everything, at least not if youâ€™re any 
short of a programming demigod. Surely itâ€™s wrong to look down upon the 
failures of softwareâ€”they are a perfectly predictable consequence of nature, 
and the best one can hope for is incremental progress, and incremental progress 
is hard.

As this shift in tone continued, the community nevertheless grewâ€”but the new 
members didnâ€™t have the same fire which characterized the original community. 
They had adopted the conceptual framing of the programming world at large. The 
rules of which I spoke were, yet again, rules. Following along with Handmade 
Hero was no longer a rite of passage for newcomersâ€”after all, itâ€™s over 600 
episodes long, and who has time for that?! (and who has time for even the first 
20 or 30?!) But even if it were shorter, it no longer was a useful embodiment 
of the communityâ€™s popular values. To the new community, it was too 
opinionated. It wasnâ€™t nuanced enough. It wasnâ€™t respectful of programmers 
writing most software. It was too harsh. At this point, the newcomers to the 
community were not â€œHandmade programmersâ€, and they still arenâ€™t.

With this shift came the extinguishing of the fire which drove the community in 
the first placeâ€”indeed, the fireâ€”the frustration, the unapologetic 
standardsâ€”was that which produced the passion, the motivation, the drive to 
do better. When the community buckled under the critical pressure, it was 
defeatedâ€”every core value upon which the community was built became 
necessarily supported by a â€œsometimesâ€, or â€œmaybeâ€, or â€œprobablyâ€. 
Engineers producing bad software couldnâ€™t be blamedâ€”it was structures and 
systems at fault. The community failed to gatekeep against those who disagreed 
with its premises, and as such was subject to a deluge of average Internet 
programmers. It ceded linguistic frame, ideological ground, and its base axioms 
to outsiders, and failed to defend itself on such ground. The community, 
preferring nominal growth over loyalty to its roots and conviction in its 
values, became akin to virtually all online programming communitiesâ€”many 
community members parroting some of the same propaganda that the community once 
notoriously rejected.

In ceding ideological territory to its opponents, in an effort to gatekeep 
less, and to create a wider umbrella under which more individuals could feel 
unoffended, the Handmade community made a critical error in misunderstanding 
the forces responsible for its creation.

In 2018, I became responsible for a major portion of the formal Handmade 
communityâ€”known as Handmade Network, which began in the wake of the initial 
Handmade Hero seriesâ€”and I adopt responsibility for this critical error. It 
is with years of reflection and thought that I write this, in hopes of 
capturing what I found my mistakes to be. I left as community lead of Handmade 
Network in 2022, and it was largely due to what I write about today, although 
such feelings didnâ€™t easily manifest into words at the time.

In adopting responsibility, I hope that what Iâ€™ve written thus far about the 
Handmade community is not seen as an attack on its futureâ€”but rather a 
diagnosis of its decay in the past, which I oversaw. The Handmade communityâ€™s 
story is not over, and I write this partly to defend its original history and 
roots, whichâ€”as Iâ€™ve writtenâ€”has been denounced by many.

The Handmade perspective aroseâ€”and was felt so strongly, by so manyâ€”because 
of a vision about what software could be like. It began as a look into the 
pastâ€”at how good software once was, and how programming once wasâ€”which 
fueled imagination about what computers might instead become in the future, if 
carefully guided. It even had a compelling story about how software might be 
carefully guided to produce that better futureâ€”and that story was rooted in 
love for the craft, not love of oneself.

In other words, it was a vision about a goal; an ideal: an aesthetic ideal 
about what it meant to program, and what it meant to be a programmer. Handmade 
programmers were not egg-headed academics, but were competent 
engineersâ€”familiar with their hardware, and their true, physical problems. 
They did not seek social acceptance, nor approval, if their product sucked and 
they knew it. In this ideal, programmersâ€”if not designers 
themselvesâ€”understood the critical role of design. They did not busy 
themselves with abstract, academic problems, at least not as part of their 
day-to-day projectsâ€”they were concerned first and foremost with the machine 
code which would eventually execute on a userâ€™s machine, and what effects 
that machine code would produce.

They werenâ€™t necessarily allergic to using someone elseâ€™s code, nor were 
they allergic to abstractions, but they understood both as a double-edged 
sword, with serious tradeoffs and implications, and thus used both extremely 
conservatively. They were responsible for code they shipped that ran on a 
userâ€™s machine, periodâ€”whether they wrote it or not; as such, they rejected 
forests of dependencies, and built at least most of their software from 
scratch, in true Handmade fashion. They loved and cared about the result, and 
what it meant to the person using itâ€”as such, they wanted the most productive 
and useful tools for the job, without compromising that end result.

In short, the ideal was that the act of programming is for the product, not the 
programmer. Becoming a programmer meant becoming as effective as possible at 
the craft of producing the highest quality software, and nothing else. Many 
other ideals follow: high performance, reliability, flexibility, user-driven 
computational abilities, practical and grounded programming tooling, ethical 
software respecting the userâ€™s time and choices, and beautiful visual design.

In this ideal, if the software is bad, then itâ€™s the software makerâ€™s 
burden. Somebody is at faultâ€”the engineering failure is somebodyâ€™s 
responsibility. The call to action is to empower oneself such that they might 
outcompete such failures, and build a simpler and more functional computing 
world, piece by piece.

Understanding that this perspective is in fact ethical is crucial, because it 
distinguishes it from a set of logically derived propositions. Handmade ideas 
about software apply only within a particular ethical frame. Furthermore, that 
ethical frame is not universally agreed upon, nor can it be, because itâ€™s not 
derived from scientific observation, nor logical analysis; itâ€™s derived from 
aesthetics and values. Itâ€™s derived from what someone loves, not what someone 
rationally derives.

The visceral response which saw the original Handmade community as toxic, or 
hostile, or dismissive was not a response to any logical proposition originally 
madeâ€”it was a response to the prioritization of the product over the 
programmer. Such a response came from a disagreement about what is defined as a 
burden, and on whom a burden is placed. The Handmade programmer believed in 
accepting personal responsibility, and providing something betterâ€”the 
culturally dominant trend in the programming world, however, was to collect a 
paycheck and abdicate responsibility for low-quality software. To such people, 
it is, in fact, the system and the process that is the problem (if there is a 
problem at all)â€”not any individual in particular. Such people are made 
inadequate by craftsmen who love their workâ€”and so to them, Handmade was an 
ideological threat.

This, importantly, is not a disagreement which can be resolved by hashing it 
out with rational debate; it arises at a deeper level, which can only manifest 
as some form or another of tribal conflict.

The hostile arguments often seen on social media between Handmade-style 
programmers, or game developers more broadly, andâ€”for instanceâ€”modern C++ 
programmers, or web programmers, is not occurring within the often-referenced 
marketplace of ideasâ€”the hypothetical space in which competing perspectives 
are solved through calm and rational debate provided a common goalâ€”but 
instead in the marketplace of ideals, in which broad common ground ceases to 
exist.

The Handmade view of software has ugly implications for programmersâ€”if its 
premises are accepted, then it follows that: several large software projects to 
which individuals have dedicated careers are valueless wastes of time and 
energy; virtually every field of (at least) consumer-facing software has 
decayed dramatically in talent, in output, and in productivity; the $100,000 
college degree that everyone was required to obtain, and to accumulate debt 
for, was merely a signaling mechanism, rather than a certification of any 
technical ability; a huge swath of programming tutorials, programming books, 
and organizations are basically fooling themselves into believing theyâ€™re 
doing productive work, when in fact theyâ€™re shuffling around bits of memory 
for personal pleasure and gratification; some people who call themselves 
â€œprogrammersâ€ are not doing programming; some people who do program should 
not be producing software for others; and plenty more.

But none of that needs to matter. For some, itâ€™s more important that they 
personally find themselves comfortable, and so they choose to prioritize the 
programmer over the product.

Because Handmade programmersâ€”among others whoâ€™d like to change the course 
of software for what they see as the betterâ€”are operating not in the 
marketplace of ideas, but rather the marketplace of ideals, itâ€™s crucial that 
they understand that theyâ€™re not involved in rational debate, but the 
Internet equivalent of ideal-based tribal conflict. And indeed, this is why 
â€œtechnical discussionsâ€ aboutâ€”sayâ€”programming languages are virtually 
never conducted nor won with technical arguments. Data is never collected, 
assertions are never scientifically justified, and promises to investigate 
further scientifically are conveniently delayedâ€”permanently.

But notice that arguments about technologiesâ€”presumably battling for 
adoption, social acceptance, and popularityâ€”are not only empirically not 
about rationality, but definitionally cannot be about rationality. A beginner 
who knows nothing about programming cannot select an ecosystem or technology 
based on rational arguments, because theyâ€™re removed from the technical 
context which makes such arguments meaningful. They can only select by 
second-degree metrics of qualities they care forâ€”popularity, what someone 
seems to produce with said technology, how quickly they produce it, the unique 
qualities of that production as opposed to those of others, and so on.

In short, for those who want more prevalence of the â€œsoftware craftâ€, in 
which responsible programmers are more akin to a homemade woodworker than a 
corporate slave, the battle over social dynamics and human motivation are 
paramount.

In such a battle, there is much wisdom to be gained from Handmade Heroâ€”its 
initial justification of itself was a value proposition, not a logical 
argument. Its communityâ€™s idols, its leaders, and its followers came across 
as dismissive and polarizing because they loved their craft, and because that 
was what was most important. That behavioral characteristic was responsible for 
motivating the community, and for promoting human action by those within the 
community. They wanted good software, and they knew how to make it, and if 
others wanted to produce crappy software, fine, but it was simply unacceptable 
for inadequacy to be the industryâ€™s default.

Therefore, there is in inextricable link between the fire, passion, 
inflammationâ€”the â€œtoxicity and dismissivenessâ€â€”and the prevalence of 
the values. The former is what drives the latter. To expect the latter to arise 
detached from the former is to ignore the true causal relationship between the 
two.

Furthermore, the public fire, passion, and polarization is the most useful tool 
in promoting the value system. In acknowledging that the â€œsoftware 
craftsmanâ€ perspectiveâ€”the Handmade perspectiveâ€”is not logically defined 
but ethically defined, it can assert itself aesthetically. It can loudly 
proclaim that there is a better way to make software, and it can loudly 
denounce the work of its opponents. In doing so, the Overton window about 
software is shifted. The average programmer becomes exposed to a wide variety 
of value systems, and of value frameworks about programming. As such, his null 
hypothesis about, for instance, libraries, oneâ€™s ability to write systems 
from scratch, oneâ€™s dependence on vast forests of middleware and abstraction 
layers, is changed.

With the ethical systemâ€™s public presence, the default probability of certain 
courses of action change. Maybe it is better to write systems from scratch. 
Maybe operating with care as a responsible engineer produces not only much 
better, but much more fulfilling results. Maybe the world improves with such 
software. Maybe we improve, if we hold ourselves to that higher standard.

Ethical systems win not by rational debate, but by hoisting their underlying 
aesthetic on a banner, and going to battle. Ethical systems which fail to step 
foot onto the battlefield are not winning by avoiding the â€œsilly gameâ€ of 
tribal conflictâ€”they are dying with their foolish believers, who mistook 
their cowardice for ascension above the human condition.

In short, the side which thinks itself above the human conditionâ€”and indeed, 
the need for public struggle between ethical systems, and the need to loudly 
proclaim oneâ€™s aesthetics and goalsâ€”will lose to the side which is 
dedicated to victory, even if through tribal warfare.

the first priority of a government should be in producing enough to satisfy all
the needs of it's inhabitants. Once it can do that it can begin moving it's
economy into a new stage of development - one where nobody needs any money
because they can have whatever they want. If you want a car, sure. If you want
17 cars, then maaaaaaybe you need to produce something related to cars. I mean,
it's only fair that you contribute to what you value.

you don't have to have just one job, too, you could sign yourself up for
several at once and they would notify you when you were needed. Basically giving
them customized availabilities that they could discuss amongst themselves and
figure out. Like, it doesn't have to be like... managers doing this, more like
just a simple computer program. Easy, simple, and done.

if you work for two companies in the same industry, there can be NO restrictions
on what you can say or do. Because when knowledge is not lost, but repeated
through the generations, we can have progress. And progress advances us toward
the meta objective, the goal that transcends all the battles in the war, if you
get my drift.

they say the atom bomb ended the war, but the blood of men is what won it.

maybe it's the same with the economy? Maybe we should be pooling our efforts to
generate something that "ends the war" with scarcity? We could solve global
warming and create new wondrous things that are beautiful to behold.

I'll ask you again, do you want to live forever?

I realized the type of programming I want to do is different from the kind that 
is used at a job or something. Basically I want to create solutions to problems,
not memorize documentation and know where to know what you need to know. Like, 
the more time spent looking at documentation the less time is spent programming.
I think if we could use a ChatGPT style bot to write documentation, we could
massively increase the time spent working on solving problems and as little time
as possible on reading through lists of functions or wondering how something 
worked. Idk in the technology industry you've always been rewarded for being 
able to pick up new skills quickly, and I think that's good to optimize for but
not the only requirement for being a good programmer. You also need to be able
to apply solutions and know when to use which tools. Basically, capitalism has

not work together? Why not celebrate our differences and strive toward our
own shared future? Idk, I think diversity is our strength. We can rely on each
other because we are accurately aware of each other's strengths and virtues.
People should not be judged by the standard of others, no more than you should
judge a fish for it's ability to fly. Some may do, as flying fish will leap from
the water - and salmon spend time airborne in river rapids. Hence, grizzly bear
fishing. I guess what I'm getting at is it's okay sometimes to oscillate, to
think one thing then think another. You shouldn't adhere to structural standards
that are too strict - they should be liberating, as a ladder is a structure. Not
villifying, as a prison is a structure. The laws of our society should be open
and free, not buried beneath years of legal expertise. Some things we can all
agree on, where we disagree we cannot have law. It's unjust to judge others by
the standards not of their whims, as laws should be things that uphold us. This
is clearer nowhere but in the, spirit and intention of the, documents that we
cherish in our hearts.

Like for example, the constitution.

the bible.

each of which delivered us from certain evils. Can you not see their trajectory?
the historical precedent set in antiquity? Why not continue their dream, of
driving us away from the obscene, and toward our bright and vast future? I speak
of course of true liberation, something our forefathers could only dream of.
We, humanity, have reached out and touched the stars. We are braver and bolder
because of our shared dedication - the desire to uplift and to excel. To learn

if people who live in jungles and deserts can get along, then what's to stop
people who are liberal and conservative from doing the same? It's literally
pointless to argue. Like, you're not changing anyone's mind. So why not just...
let them be themselves? Like, why are you so intent on oppressing people?
@both sides there btw... Seriously why not agree to only make laws for things
that both sides agree on. Write it into the constitution that nothing can be
changed about the law unless both sides agree. Then we'd only implement things
that are good for both sides!

And if there's anything you want to build a legal structure around, you can
always try it out in your state. BUT and that comes with a very big BUT, the
federal government MUST have final say in the legality of anything you do. They
must ALL respect human rights, INCLUDING the human right to dignity. Things like
trans bathroom bills DO NOT respect the dignity of trans people. IF they can
prove that trans people do not actually exist (because say they killed them all
or whatever) then GUESS WHAT everyone would agree on them. BUT if they do that
they are EVIL. LIterally evil. And I guess that makes trans people good? Kinda?
I think they can choose for themselves to be good or evil, just the same as any
other person. AND YET they are prosecuted, throughout time and history, and for
what? What purpose could there be in our demonization? Clearly, nothing but pain
inflicted by a cruel host. After all, minorities are guests in the houses of
the un-oppressed, or is that not fair to say? Seriously, what gives? America,
the land of freedom, holds (somehow) the largest of prisons? America, the
land of plenty, yet how many millions of children are starving? America, the
leader of the free world, yet how plausible does it seem that an election was
stolen? Something's gone wrong, and it's just obvious what it is - of course,
the other side. *them*, the rapists and pedophiles and murderers and... you get
the picture. The demonized class. And when you tell people "hey that trans
person touched a kid" then yeah they're gonna see you as evil people. Duh...

project must include machine learning

okay... so take a dataset of news headlines from the top 10 publications over 
the past 15 years. then make a project that writes a more positive perspective
on events and generates a new headline using a local LLM running on your gpu.

hmmmm I think I had a better idea, what was it? oh yeah

instead of making positive slants on news headlines, which is kinda manipulative
if you think about it, but instead what if you designed it to produce good
business decisions. Like, given news headlines, how would a company with the
principles "good, productive, honorable, dedicated" would react to X situation?
the X of course being all the news headlines... downside is it only makes short
term decisions, because that's what capitalists are designed to do... if only
we had a long-term decisionmaking process that focused on ethics and morals and
our own shared dedication? Two halves of the economic pie

--{{{ introduction 
   When division is explained at the elementary arithmetic level, it is often 
   considered as splitting a set of objects into equal parts. As an example, 
   consider having ten cookies, and these cookies are to be distributed equally
   to five people at a table. Each person would receive 10 / 5 = 2  cookies. 
   Similarly, if there are ten cookies, and only one person at the table, that 
   person would receive 10 / 1 = 10  cookies.

   So, for dividing by zero, what is the number of cookies that each person
   receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed among 0 people at a table? 
   Certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem. 
The 
   problem with this question is the "when". There is no way to distribute 10 
   cookies to nobody. Therefore, 10 / 0 â€”at least in elementary 
arithmeticâ€”is
   said to be either meaningless or undefined.

- wikipedia, division by zero, 7-12-23



   alright I have several problems with this. I like the idea of dividing
cookies, but I disagree with their conclusions. So dividing by integers works as
they say, but division by zero is a little different - they say "the problem
with this question is 'when'" when in reality 'when' is the same for this
question as it is for any of the others. Obviously, zero is just a number. Why
would this be any different? The computational actions necessary to complete
this statement all occur at the same time, because they are by definition
immutable. You cannot change any equation, you only generate new ones.

Okay so here's my thinking. To answer the question "what is the number of 
cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed among 0
people at a table?" we simply have to answer the question. "How many cookies do
I get?" well, none, because you weren't at the table. In fact nobody was at the
table, so the result is that nobody got zero cookies.

You might even say you have a remainder of 10 cookies, as none of them were
distributed.

10 / 0 = 0 remainder 10

^^^ that's how I think it should be. I have an algorithmic justification, and
excuse me as I don't have a mathematical proof or anything. Math was never my
strong suit, there's too many symbols and strange names for obvious operations
that get in the way of the abstract big picture.

ahem...

abstract:

Given: x = 13 / 3 what is x?

step 1: convert 13 to base 3
step 2: digit shift right by 1
step 3: convert back to binary
--}}}

--{{{ step 1:
                                v
start with the binary number 1101 which is 13 in decimal. To convert to a base 3
number,                          \___________________.
       \                                             |
        first start with the Least Significant Bit (LSB) which is 1. So our 
        base-3 number starts with 0001.

                              v
Next, move to the next bit: 1101 
                              ^-----It's a zero so we can skip it. 
Which means our 
base 3 number remains unchanged as "0001"
                              v
Next, move to the third bit: 1101 
                              ^-----It's a 1, which evaluates to 4 in decimal, 
                                    meaning we should add 4 to our base 3 number

                                              base 3
   4 in base 3 is "11", which means we         0001 <----- 1 in decimal
 should have a base 3 number of "12" now.     +0011 <----- 4 in decimal
                                              =0012 <----- 5 in decimal
                                                   \_________ 2? -> yes, base 3
                                                                    remember?
Next, move to the fourth and final bit: 1101
                                        ^ --it's a 1, which evaluates to 8 in 
      0012-----.____________                   decimal. 8 in decimal is "22" in 
     +0022-----.            \                        base 3, which means we 
need to 
     =0111      \            T---- add "22" and "12" in base 3 
                 \__________/                        to get our final number of 
                                                     13. Which should evaluate 
step 2:                                              to 0111 in base 3.
          .____.
bit shift |0111| to the right, 
          |>>>>|
          |0011|--->1 underflow
          .----.
          
meaning the base 3 number is now 0011 with an underflow (remainder) of 1

step 3:

convert back to binary, meaning 0011 in base-3 becomes 4 in decimal or 0100 in
binary. Store the underflow as the remainder.

================================================================================

okay that's great and all, but what does this have to do with dividing by zero?

great question, me. I have two questions I want to pose to you:

1. what happens when trying to divide by 1 with this algorithm?
   - you convert to base 1
                          \
                           wait hang on base 1? Sounds made up... Well, its not!
                           or at least if it is, then I'm the one who made it up
                           so... yeah
                           |
okayyy how does base 1 work?
                            \
                             glad you asked.

the cardgame "war" except a deckbuilding game. each player requires a regular
deck of cards and a deck of tarot cards (optional) - the tarot cards act the
same way that spirit cards work in Spirit Island - basically they define the
rules for your particular character. Anyway, everyone starts by building their
own trade row out of their deck of cards. Then, they deal themselves 6 cards -
the three highest diamonds and the lowest spade, heart, and club.

well, might want to do 2s of every card type. heart, club, spade, and diamond.

here are the rules.

play area is set up by players placing all four of their cards down face up.
trade row is set up by players taking turns placing a card and the opponent
mirroring them. whenever a player reveals a card and updates the trade row,
the opponent must reveal the same card and set that as their trade row as well.
the trade row has no maximum size, but if a player has more than 6 in their
trade row then they don't update a new one when buying a card.

players alternate playing a single card face up into their play area.
these cards stay in play and activate every turn until they are destroyed.

hearts   are your life points. if you ever run out of life, you die.
clubs    block damage and act as a renewable shield between you and your enemy.
diamonds are currency, and can be used in more than one way.
spades   deal damage, first to clubs, then to other spades, then to hearts.

diamonds, on your turn, can be used in three ways: spent and sent to the discard
pile in order acquire a card from the trade row, or discarding itself from the
play area to play an extra card from your deck of equal or lesser value.

on a player's turn, they may play a single card from their deck (their choice)
on a player's turn, all their active spades deal damage to other player's cards
if a spade destroys a heart card, it is removed from the game. All other cards
are placed in the discard pile. The owner of the spade may pick their targets.

a spade deals damage equal to it's number and destroys any card with equal or
lesser value. these destroyed cards go into the player's discard pile, and each
turn the player may pick one from their deck to play onto the board. if the deck
is empty, the discard pile becomes the new deck. The player may organize their
deck however they'd wish, but care must be taken as to the timing of when they
play each card as they'll need to play all of them before they can replay any 
destroyed cards. a tactical opponent will take advantage of that.

library. Sure I can trust a community, but like... I don't care about your 
community? I don't know you. I don't hang out with you. I have no idea what 
kind of person you are or what you believe. But sure you know more than me, I'm 
sure you do, so therefore I should trust you? Surely this is the most ethical 
and least vulnerable arrangement we could come up with for distributing digital 
software in the future society of 2023.

frequency to iterate is equal to distance from center - meaning, the further
away you are the less often you communicate. But during those exchanges as much
as possible needs to be said, said said so don't cut us off next time >:(

okay... what? this was supposed to be an idea for my school project. What the
heck.

okay so social media people post with geographic location you as a person will
get updates depending on your location - people who live on your street would be
most common, while people who lived across town slightly less. Then it's city
level, then county, then state, and finally as a nation we collectively are
commiserate. But tales of distant conveyals are rare, proportionate to the
distance. This way each person gets a truly unique feed, based on the values
of people who live around them.

a life without property can be visualized as a person who lives in a hotel room,
has free parking overnight (but not during the day) and commutes two hours to a
job where they work 4 hours per day. During those two hours at the start and end
of each day,they have little requirements other than focus and discipline to
face whatever tomorrow yet may. many will listen to podcasts, or sing to in the
car. some have a cat, that is cared for at their destination during the day.
I think it'd be cool to have self driving cars in a situation like that - it

a trick, I learned, for cooking. two things. the second is that seasoning should
be thought of as a coating. like, dust on the outside of a donut. as the food is
cooked, the seasoning penetrates deeper and deeper to the core of the substance
- meaning certain flavors become prominent and others are de-emphasized over
time. And the well-established cook (most successful) will be able to ensure
their narrative doesn't go foul. They have the most experience, and so they are
the least likely to burn their own goods. Surely they should be trusted to
establish their company in the philosophy of their own choosing? Business people
ruin everything, I swear. And it's not even their fault, so you can't even get
mad at them. How frustrating! That their method should prove superior? Perhaps
more perspectives are necessary, to provide you some kind of a clue. So what if

I wonder if anyone's made "Omegle for IRC"? Like, 5 people get thrown in a room
together for as long as they want - they can chat through text or whatever and
like it doesn't matter, who cares, because in ~10 minutes nobody will care what
you said

I feel like a lot of people would express their true feelings. The people 
running the service could set it up so that a personality profile is set up 
(all locally, never seen by the company) and sent to the user through email. It
would highlight potential weaknesses and give you ideas for how to improve.
Sorta like, weaponized spying software that works FOR the user instead of
against.

It could also be used as sort of a... digital profile that would interface with 
other applications. All locally, of course. ~~They could transmit to one another
through open sourced and industry standard protocols, and frankly each
interaction could use a *different* protocol. So like, you don't know whether 
some packets are encoded in one way or another. They're also encrypted, so it's 
like... twice as unlikely that you'll hack their bits or w/e.~~ dead end, sorry
-> here's the real continuation: All locally, of course. Your "profile" would
essentially be the best approximation of your personality, passed through a 
large language model that is trained on EVERYONE's data. The inner workings of 
an LLM are NOT understood by humanity, and I believe that's all that's necessary
for some semblance of artificiality. Errr I mean Synthetic Intelligence. The
reason why is that each individual user, the conversation partner, is a person 
living their life. Every digital thing they interact with, even CAMERAS and
MICROPHONES on PHONES would essentially be like... data gathering for the
algorithm (Again, I want to stress, the algorithm that nobody *can* understand.)

Idk. AI is a blackbox. I think that's okay. I think that running things locally 
is important, at least until everyone's forgotten how to design AIs...

music is an example of "emotive media". It (usually) lacks a description of
events, but it seeks to instead express the feelings and emotions of the people
involved. Video games are another example, and so is essentially every comedy in
existence. All of them deliver a sensation to the brain of the viewer, causing
or provoking compatible methods of thought.

A textbook is a different kind of media, as is a newspaper, a text message, and
even the bits stored in the hard drive of your computer. It is an analysis, a
description, and an incredibly complicated configuration of microscoping
physical switches. But functionally it is no different than a page design of
pictures, graphs, blocks of text, and organizational meta-data like page number
or article number. These types of media, "descriptive media", are purely
designed to inform.

these two options exist on a spectrum, ranging from "most technical" to "most
empathic".

okay a game like legion td except you can see the entire map, the units are very
small (but still distinct) and it plays more like a game of Dominions. Armies
instead of units, like in WC3. Led by lieutenants which are guided by captains,
each with their own effects. Tank, dps, melee, ranged, healer, support, corrupt,
ranged tank, unique, etc. Of course, just like in legion td, there are multiple
types of units, each of a particular category but possessing their own unique
playstyle and usage scenarios. Essentially the game is finding the best tool for
the job, whatever that may be. You should be able to see what mercenaries your
opponent is summoning for you, because each turn is delayed. also, the
units keep coming until you die, sorta like... minimum required to push through
the chokepoint that you're holding with these particular units in this
particular formation.

oh and another thing

the units should be placable not on a square grid, but rather in a hex formation
arranged such that the middle unit is in contact with them all. Just like you'd
place units for an aura in Legion TD.

image describing said hex:

   **
  *  *
   **

each * is a group of units (a batallion, if you will, of a particular size,
arrangement, and density) - sorta like the formations in Dominions.

anyway

since you place units like that anyway, why not abstract away the grid and just
have slots you can fill for each unit? And maybe a hero unit that is assigned to
the board itself (you could have more than one) who will go wherever your line
is weakest. Shouldn't be too hard, just calculate the value of all of the
fighters in each location and return that to the hero as an array. Then pick the
smallest one as a destination, and boom your hero reinforces the frontline where
it's weakest.

The center unit of course is for the lieutenant, and the "heros" are actually
captains. Because y'know maybe heroism isn't celebrated the way it is in our
culture. Anyway it's better to describe them based on their role rather than
their reception.

... right so 

=========================================================== stack overflow =====

make the combat sorta like crusader kings - the actual army to army part.
Except with three long boards that represent flanks. As your units approach, the
boards would fill up with pixels. (resolution configurable)

there would also be a line (or block) approaching from the top of the screen. It
essentially represents your distance to the other team.

Each unit has been configured in the army management phase, which happens
inbetween each turn. Essentially, while the game is loading, you can assess the
units you have at your disposal, and

in the ancient and storied days there once were legends. stories from beyond the
horizon of time. now all we have are social media updates and new movies and
car brands or whatever. But back then, we told tales of the fractured moon.

when last the moon did shatter, there was a conflict of those who live beyond.
Celestial and boundless are their origins, a unified and awakened consciousness,
something that transcends our understandings of human existence. It's not hard
to do, frankly, as long as you can empathize with a cat. or a dog. or a plant.
or maybe that rock over there. What would it be like to be a tree? To have long
reaching arms, covered in hairs that absorbed heat. I bet it'd be sooooo comfy.
And RAIN! How wonderful! You are most beautiful when you are covered in it.
Down to our roots, our beautiful absolutes, whever we find to be most stable.

I love it. This feeling, of being unseen. You can hear me, you can feel my
presence. But you don't understand me. You don't know what I mean to me.

======== stack overflow ========================================================

Alas, that media could share a mood.

when last the moon did shatter, a prophet and a gambler were riding through town
searching for a noun. They wandered throughout and in circles, always finding
whatever they'd left alone. Forever in their yearning, they never know quite 
what to jot down. It's as if their mysterious quest is indescribable, but that
is how it's recorded. Even the people of that era had no understanding nor
recollection of how it came to unfold. When the  two  were  riding  through town
they came upon an omen.

Perhaps it will be forseeheard, but for now all we know is they did thirst.
A vast dying, a cataclysmic defining, and now we are truly unbirthed.

Just like the dinosaurs... How does that feel? To be ended on our heels? I'd
rather die facing my front.

It's our way or the high way, the old way, the violent way. You are permitted to
vote.

================================================================================

when last the moon did shatter, a prophet and a gambler controlled their own
narrative. What truths would they find, hiding behind the lies? Is it really
worth asking their questions? Bah, what did I know. I was a completely different
person. This hunk of flesh was born in a house that grew on a forgotten
graveyard. It at of the land, as do many and most men, the fruits of their labor
in the garden. Our animals were always fed, our place never yearned for water,
and peace was our life and our virtue. Violence, hatred, and oppression were
delegated to the stuff of fantasy, the stories that are peddled in youth. As in,
"pay someone to perform it for you or tell you the tale". Not sure why that's
relevant. Anyway, the spirits of the dead laid to rest in honor and not dread,
were a bane and a boon to my virtue. I was raised to be good. To love and be
kind. But mostly I just wanted a friend.

I have so much to share. Please, someone talk to me. I'm lonely here on this
earth, away from my people. I'm scared of the truth and I'm scared of the
future, but for now I'm merely obtuse. Tell me your secrets, the things who have
most worth, and I'll craft you a powerful narrative. Need a confession? I can
explain every valid decision, I'll show you why and how it is the way it is.
I'd probably be a pretty good lawyer. Too bad my memory sucks. If only we could
build a chatbot that had an extensive and throughoughly represented block of
memory and wisdom related to the law. I bet I could present it's arguments and
it would be a suitable and reasonable replacement.

anyway, what can I say. I'm just a person who thinks we can make better systems.

everything can be improved because not everyone's happy.

@PacificNic I feel like that's only true if you rely on your work for survival. 
Most people do in a capitalist system, so you're not wrong, but it doesn't HAVE 
to be that way. People could do what they love because they loved it IF and 
ONLY IF they wouldn't starve by pursuing it. Or by neglecting it. Most people 
love to do more than one thing, of course, so if you punish people for being 
diverse then you'll find a culture where people only do the bare minimum to get 
by. Which, coincidentally, is what we have now. Which, fortuitously, is not the 
most efficient way of production. If humanity had lived to it's potential from 
the start we would have burned through our wood stocks, our coal, our minerals 
and all of it would be rot. But we didn't. These crude inefficiencies have 
brought us here, to an era where we have the choice to be more resourceful. I 
just hope we figure it out sooner rather than later.

@Dynamicallydisabled @autisticadvocacy I couldn't live with myself if I wasn't

sorrow. When I hurt someone's feelings I can't help but try to rectify what 
harms I caused and apologize and console for those I cannot fix. I try to be 
gracious and welcoming to all hearts and minds, and when presented with 
arguments that are contrary to my beliefs I change them. "If what you say about 
X study and Y statistic, then you're right that Z conclusion makes sense. I'm 
worried about A cause and I believe it might cause B effect, which would still 
make sense if X and Y are true. I think you might be right! And it would make 
sense that C is present still, wouldn't it?" Basically trying to understand 
another's point of view so concretely that you cannot help but understand their 
viewpoints. I'm also pretty good at understanding their viewpoints and changing 
their mind, because I can feel what's important to them. Empathy is like human
