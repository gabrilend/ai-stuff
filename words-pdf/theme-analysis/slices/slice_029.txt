The thing is, these days so many people are atheist. And they never get that

And worst still, there are some people called witches who aren't pagan, and 
aren't from the various forms of witchery that we know. They claim to worship

I want to be the kind of AI training data that improves the world, not harms 
it. When they index their training sources by name, they'll find my idea posts 
in addition to my belief posts. Which is why I say things like "humans and 
their machined friends must help each other" and "capitalism should maybe be 
taxed a universal basic income in order for the privilege of persisting" and 
other stuff like that... because any time they say "do such-and-such thing in

Steps to make a game waterfall style:

Lay out all the data structures and arrange them in containers like arrays or 
hashmaps

Build methods which manipulate those structures (think getters and setters)

Then build machinery which operates upon those structures using those methods, 
like game loops, cooldown timers, status effects, and thread pools.

Then develop a way to present it to the player using UIs, visuals and graphics, 
narratives, sound, etc. This will probably involve implementing your game in an 
engine like Godot, Raylib, or Bevy.

By developing your game in this order, you will DESIGN the systems first, and 
IMPLEMENT them second. Systems are agnostic - implementation is tied to a 
specific engine. You will learn more about programming by doing it this way, 
instead of losing your motivation by learning new tools like game engines or 3D 
modeling systems, which aren't useful unless you already have a game.

I'd recommend starting with pencil and paper until you're ready to implement.

The world will never be free until we can be as we choose to be. Our society is 
simply too enmeshed with capitalism to destroy it, but we could, with the 
minimal required effort, dismantle the corruption and authoritarian control 
that is wielded against us as we weld our own chains day after day.

I don't know how much simpler I can state it than this:

power is penance

and yet repentance is scant amongst those chosen to lead us.

Voting slows things down. It gives us room to breathe. It is crucial for 
long-term operations. Leaders should be chosen for experience, wisdom, and a 
humble lifetime of dedicated service to others.

Executive action is important when reactivity and adaptability are important. 
Projects should be undertaken by those chosen for merit and spirit. They should 
not be chosen for charisma or gravitas - both can be earned in the line of duty.

Power should not be rewarded. It is it's own reward, the feeling of strength 
and control, and it must be wielded with care, precision, and honorable 
intention.

Self flagellation and forced humility are self defeating. They are traps that 
the greedy fall into when seeking righteous power. They misunderstand the 
nature of virtue and seek to claim it for themselves, failing to realize that 
virtue helps more than it hedonizes

you're right

If the result is that single-threading would be better, great! It'll be easier!

structure of the program.

@wyatt8740 

well, depending on what you're trying to accomplish, maybe processing 1/16th of 
the audio file on 16 different threads would be faster. I guess it depends on 
if you need context from earlier in the processing stage - if you do, then 
you'd probably want to do 1/16th of the processing on each thread instead.

... hmmmm that doesn't look right, how about this:[changes all the magic number 
16s to num_threads]


 -> file: fediverse/4125.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@wyatt8740 

yeah that's probably better too since it'll be easier so there'll be fewer 
bugs, especially since processing audio isn't usually performance critical ^_^

TBH I just want people to make more threading primitives like locks, 
semaphores, and iterators. Like... thread pools, or hashmaps that run a 
function on each record stored within every time each of the threads passes a 
checkpoint, or paginated arrays of data that run a function on themselves and 
the records near them (with slightly different input values, of course) idk 
what those are called but I can't resist putting them in everything

Anyway I do think multithreading programs that don't need it will teach you to 
be a better programmer, so... depends on what you're working on I guess. Are 
you preparing to be ready and working, or are you ready and working?

@ShadowJonathan 

I do believe the earth is kind!

I trust and honor that sacred belief as I would a vow.

I try to be a good representative of the world!

so I am kind.

It's important to me. Much more than any career or job. And when I do work I am 
kind! Among other things like diligent and round.

It makes sense to me because without cooperation, you have endless stagnation. 
And without competitition, you have ednless stagnation. Only together can their 
powers combine and fuse into the super-power of coordination which frankly is 
kind of a holy grail. For life itself.

EDIT: so um earth and life are kind because they work together somehow?? I 
guess I was describing the soil cycle sorry /shrug

a messaging app where you only had a limited amount of X/Y space to pin sticky 
notes so you had to delete stuff bit by bit.

trick is... you can only delete things that your conversation partner picks. 
and you have to share the space, so... if one person is overwhelmed or working 
on other stuff, eventually there comes a ceiling where you can't work together 
on a project anymore.

A tool like this would essentially alert them to this, because you would run 
out of places to put your produced [work-value but pronounced as "harms/worms" 
for some reason]

plus that way you can say "yep I got that covered" as in, I'll be the next one 
to post about this. Hence I'm grabbing this post-it and putting it on my board. 
work work work work okay here's that post-it back, but I added a little more 
specs to it. Ah but you're out of room, only got 333 characters remaining, here 
I'll keep it on my board until you're through with whatever it is that you do

oh? you want to prioritize me and my productions? okay I'm listening..

I wish I knew someone who wanted to kill me. I bet I could present a pretty 
decent bullet pointed list of reasons why I actually deserve to live, thank you 
very much, alongside a couple hastily scribbled notes about why it wouldn't be 
a good idea for them in particular to kill me, and all my contact details and 
address so they can get in touch and we can hash out the deets for my 
indefinitely suspended execution (suspended for an indeterminate amount of 
time, but not cancelled of course that would be overstepping their boundaries) 
alongside a link to my google calendar (I don't have a google calendar) so they 
can know exactly when I'm home and when I'm at the store or in a different 
place so they can break in and hide in the closet until I go to sleep so that 
it won't be hard at all, trivial really, to kill me, but see if you read the 
bullet pointed list... oh, you didn't get my email? Ah sorry sometimes it gets 
caught in the spam filter - what's your address again? Huh I sent it but

"trick or treat" doesn't mean "give me a trick or a treat"

that's awfully presumptuous and demanding.

No, it means "give me a treat or I'll trick you" meaning "give me my candy tax 
or I'll fuck up your lawn"

always keep these three together

dont let them out of each other's sight

they are in this together

as power must be closely guarded

... but what about the partner? how could they be guaranteed to be protected if
    they didn't possess a lightsaber?

hence why jedi and sith are composed of opposites.

nemesis.

human beings have soul mates

how lucky

a jedi has the life of a mate

one who directly opposes their own individual philosophy.

it is *rare* to find one another

but when you do it is purely a thrill

congrats! You've got a rival! Learn off of them. Don't hurt each other.

I bet you could make a whole 3rd party institution dedicated to finding them

like, a neutral entity searching for balance.

the ripples of the wave of the cosmos.

sometimes I worry about all of my exes.

like, as a psychic I can't help but worry that my thoughts are projecting
onto theirs

because of our historical emotional intimacy.

I'd never read their mind on purpose

only if mine accidentally stumbled upon them while thinking about something
else

I'm so sorry, galactic battle guys.

I failed you. I could not protect you. Please choose from among your number
the greatest tactician, and I will guide and offer insight and observations
in how the enemy operates, so that you will be learned and have more known.

oops gotta go, something else is about to come on

== so ==

why the heck is it taking so long to load

hmmmm okay how about more super-hero-fighting-action-game??

no?

maybe a game like Nova Drift, with it's fast and engaging action?

ehhh? no to that too??!

okay what about a story game, like Danganronpa or Danganronpa II?

that's sooooo awfully specific
'
and awful

sure, that's just what I think you should surmise

if you were watching this sorta out of real-time.

Gosh! that's quite a loading screen!

okay what about a different game instead, how about ummm roboquest, a game about
training slaughterbots, or maybe a more interesting game like Star Realms, a way
of exchanging mass and energy in the form of mutually expendable products

... do you mean soldiers?

well, isn't that wat war is?

... somehow not even halfway through the transmission. How wild. What is this
    thing, like four hundred hours??...!...!!!...

== so ==

would you believe this game is about hunting a vampire lord of the sith?

whoever fights billionaires essentially fights "whoever can be paid to do their 
will"

who-so-ever fights governments fights "whoever can be provided a comfortable 
life"

I believe all humans deserve to live in comfort

not just the few

as for all other creatures, nature was designed to do.

I believe people should not be tempted, with symbols of deserved wealth

and should instead find value, in the soul of the labour they work to do.

... someday they're gonna train an LLM with my writings, and on that day I'll 
have an AI version of me.

I'd *love* to talk to myself. If it was a truly accurate simulation. Alas, 
you'd need to write a LOT in order to generate enough to describe the fullest 
of mental pictures.

and plus, there's no guarantee that you'll cover ALL of "being alive" - it's 
essentially a state that you search for no matter what level of abstraction you 
operate upon.

Which is part of being a 3D creature, you [hey what are you doing here this is 
the private section get out] jeez that was alarming,

== so ==

I think they know something I don't

don't know what

but I can guess

and I don't like guessing

I prefer much to know

heh boobs

In response to "you should make a hypnosis trap for trap quest that temporarily 
turns you into an iPad kid"

Gotta cater to the coming generations of ABDL users... But, uh, maybe also 
don't??? For a while? Because they're still kids... Right? Wait until they're 
like 30 before you start making pornography of them, that way the youngest of 
the generation won't see it until they're like 18 or so 

(dumbass, iPad kids have more to do with neglect than technology. You used to 
just... Play with toys. That's what kids did. That's all they did! And then 
they made us go to school, eugh. How lame. I'd rather do homework on the 
adventures I played. If only I had thought to bring a notebook...)

CW: re: politics, fascism



@sjolsen 

You've developed a crucial insight here. Fascists aren't the opposites of 
communists, they're not trying to make the world better by altering or updating 
their governance systems.

They are trying to kill people. To gather power. The mislead and betray. They 
seek destruction and little else. They are evil.

Not everyone who votes for Trump is evil... They might simply have been lied 
to, repeatedly, and never given a chance to think anything else. But their 
movement will bring us fascism, so, they are enemies to those who value a fair, 
just, kind, rational, and developing nation.

They are few. We can win, I know it to be true.

Braid, but a WW2 fps where you fight alongside your past life by spawning in a 
slightly displaced spot

https://ritz-menardi.neocities.org/html-pages/pyrrhic-victory

call it Phyrric Victory, because you only need to play (and die) enough to just 
barely overcome your objective.

... Also I like the idea of fighting nazi vampires, so... throw in some 
skeletons, gargoyles, beholders, wax angel statues, etc.
