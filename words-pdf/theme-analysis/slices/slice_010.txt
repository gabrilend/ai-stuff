@abetterjulie 

I'm not sure about roses, but like @miah Ms Johnson said the yellowing is 
probably a nutrient issue.

You say you re-potted them in soil after you got them? Have you tried using 
distilled water or rainwater? Sometimes the minerals added to tap water can 
harm plants.

In addition, is there a drain in your pot? You said you were keeping it 
indoors, so probably not - if not I'd recommend finding a way to drain any 
excess water out - most plants prefer a large dose of water and then for the 
soil to dry out - if the soil is perpetually damp they can start to rot.

Also, are there leaves on the roses you get? You can think of leaves like 
"solar panels" that power the "pumps" that pull the water up from the ground 
into the parts of the plant that needs it - not only are they only "on" when 
the sun hits them, but also if the store prunes them away to make them look 
nicer then there may be insufficient power to pull enough water up.

I hope you figure it out, flowers are beautiful and roses are lovely.

@RustyBertrand 

if their internal structure does not become more complex, it will be 
increasingly difficult to transport vital nutrients from one part of the body 
to another.

therefore, to create the perfect leviathan lobster god you'll need to find a 
way to manually deliver said nutrients. Possibly by a semi-permanent injection 
system, though that may harm functioning in other ways.

I'm sure their top minds are working on this as we speak.

hey does anyone want to hire me to do literally anything?

I'll work for peanuts, and I'm pretty good at programming in C. I write pretty 
well, and I'm excellent at customer service (though my profile would beg to 
differ.)

I have experience at large corporations and small ones, and I live in Portland 
OR

I do game design, and many other things besides, and I'm friendly and kind. I 
promise I won't wear my witch hat to the meeting with investors, unless you 
think they'd be into that?

I'm great with animals, better than people in fact, and I'm quite good with 
people, as they're just animals at best. I'm not as strange as I seem to be, at 
least not when you're dancing with my mask.

I've grown quite bored, you see, and what better thing is there to be? than a 
working professional who knows what's best.

I believe in our shared future, so if you'd like to work on a project just let 
me know - I work hard. A little too hard, because odds are I'll burn out after 
a year or so.

I'm quite sharp, and I learn quickly.

@wyatt8740 

we should build a stockpile of things like this, and if the supply ever dips 
below a certain threshold (20% maybe?) we should spin up a new factory that 
produces them until we're back at a healthy margin, based on present (and 
projected future) demand.

It seems like just a video game console, but these are our heritage. They 
define our culture in a way that is incalculable in value. WHY would we ever 
run out? It's inconceivable, it's not like they go bad! Okay maybe the 
batteries corrode or something, but that's a solvable problem.

Maybe even on the second production run we could improve them somehow, I dunno. 
Give them a better processor that's fully backwards compatible, so we can make 
new and better games for them.

Or just leave them as they are, I dunno I'm not a market analyst. But the point 
is that we, in this technologically advanced future society, should not run out 
of gameboys.

forgive my fiery language, but we've enslaved the products of our labor to 
serve only the interests of those who covet them. Like dragons mounting a pile 
of gold and proclaiming it their own, even though the dwarves mined it, they 
smelted it from ore, they minted it, and they traded it afar... And the dragon 
covets, because it's much easier to steal a pile of gold and hoard it than to 
build beautiful halls of mountain kings in the depths below the earth.

... sorry, anyway you're totally right, it's abhorrent that we'd be forced to 
hide the bounty of human technological progress because someone, somewhere 
wanted to make profit off of a 20 year old handheld. Somehow.

Or perhaps they're interested in the principle of the thing, that we should 
respect their sovereignty over the intellectual marvels they claim to have 
created. When really the engineers are given nothing but wages......

And to that I say, I rebel against you.

gotta agree, random reddit commenter I found in the messages I sent to my

doomscrolling through our early love during a sorta fight that we might be 
having but I'm not sure because he's too burnt out to talk to me and it's 
tearing me up inside but I don't know what to do about it because if I message 
him he'll ignore me which probably means it hurts him to think about me which 
honestly is not a good feeling but frankly I don't know what else to do because

I'm 29, and I had Pokemon Silver growing up. However I bought it used, and the 
battery was worn out or something because it wouldn't save! But still I played 
that single game for months on my gameboy color, trying to see how far I could 
get. I had a level 40+ Totodile (or was it Crocanaw? I forget) and 
unfortunately one day I took it on a 30 minute car ride, expecting the battery 
to last at least 30 minutes, but unbeknownst to my child self there was 
construction on the way, which turned it into a 4+ hour drive. I couldn't 
believe it! The battery died, and I lost my save file... I was heartbroken. T.T

Next time I played, I learned a lot. I actually read some of the dialogue text, 
and learned you could use pokeballs to capture pokemon

I was so dumb I was using a single character to get through the game. What a 
n00b.

Anyway when my mom heard about my tribulations she bought me Pokemon Gold, 
which I played quite a bit less. I was focused on other things you see, like 
Dragon Warrior Three. Alas.

whoa cool 🤩​

Dragon Warrior was the first game I ever played. When I was ~5 years old or so, 
my mother bought a gameboy color for me with two games before we went on a 
plane ride. I don't even remember where we were going, but the fact that she 
knew that a portable video game console with two games (Dragon Warrior 1&2, and 
Super Mario Bros Deluxe) would shut my autistic ADHD ass up enough to be 
respectable on an airplane makes me realize how much she saw me. Thank you, 
mom, I love you

Anyway I was the eldest "brother" (I'm trans lmao jokes on you, family in the 
past) so if anyone deleted my save I would kick their ass :D

It still happened once or twice and I did not, in fact, kick their asses, 
though I wanted to. Shame. Missed opportunities I guess

Though to be fair it's not like anyone in my family ever expressed the 
slightest interest in anything I was into. Not like they'd want to play games 
because it was something they wanted, oh no - they would only do it to be close 
to me. Whatever >.>

Telluride is so cool! I went snowboarding there once, it was an awesome

slid off the road - mostly pickup-trucks that were shiny and big and new - the 
kind that would hang plastic ballsacks from their rear bumper because they were 
"cool" or whatever. Anyway we got a kick out of laughing at them. Looking back 
I kinda feel like we were a little heartless, and that we should have stopped, 
but we didn't see any people waving us down so I'm assuming that they had 
already been helped. I hope.

there are endless problems to solve, yet hardly anyone around to fix them.

If only we had a small group of people who could organize and say "hey. I need 
someone to solve this particular problem" to a large group of people with 
nothing to do and no bills to pay, I feel like we could get a lot done.

alas, the problems that need solving are too specific and complex. Almost by 
design, they've stripped us our capabilities to address the difficulties they 
hoisted upon us. Alas! That we should be so morassed. But time and again our 
ingenuity compels us.

I dream of a world where people like you and I have a purpose, something we can 
apply ourselves to and eventually overcome. I subscribe to "grand narratives", 
but frankly they're only of my own design. Does that make them any less grand?

primary conversation spaces in social media should be no larger than the size 
of a conversation. 

A few years ago I heard that humans can only really keep track of about 5 
things before they need symbols to keep track of them. Maybe it was 7, or maybe 
11, I'm not sure - the exact count eludes me.

But another thing I heard was that we can generally keep track of around 70 
people in our lives - beyond that it's hard to remember specifics. And yet our 
social media sites gives us friends for life, because honestly who's going to 
kick someone off their friend list?

At least, that's how it feels coming from a social background of games. In 
Runescape you'd add someone if they were cool, and completely forget about

did you know you can run runescape classic offline, locally, just for your own 
server? You can keep several computers ready for a LAN party, each with their 
own accounts ready to go.

"Oh we're level 30 this time because so-and-so is hosting and this is how far 
their computer has levelled up."

vim ~/games/runescape-classic/credentials.txt

at least, I think you can. I know it's singleplayer, so worst case scenario you 
can all be doing the same things at the same time in your own games. Maybe 
split up for a mission or two, but it can get hectic if everyone's in the same 
room.

a game jam where everyone works on the same project, uses the same asset list, 
but builds their own collection of minigames.

common functions could be shared, and art references distributed and together 
they could design a whole land. Like, there's no reason minigames can't be 
fully fledged experiences. You can have as many as you want, all in the same 
engine and built from a massive (yet sandboxed) environment.

an all in one game.

growing up I frequently bought this magazine called "101 PC games" - it had 101 
video game demos on a disc taped to the front. It was the coolest thing I owned.

each edition had a different set of demos - there were over 14 published! That 
means a minimum of 1404 video game demos available. Unfortunately, I only had a 
few copies. Now they are precious to me, though I've long since lost the discs. 
I can't seem to find a link or barely a reference to it online, so I can't help 
but feel it was defining.

I was given a taste of many experiences, but very few of them really resonated 
with me. The others were good games, and I played them from time to time, but 
my favorites were always my home.

I had some full games, so I knew what I was missing, but still I looked out for 
cheats. sometimes the writers would leave a hint or a clue to the solution to a 
puzzle in the demo, just incase it was hard to continue. I dunno, I loved it 
and it was special to me.

one cool collective artist trick is to make a piece of art, then someone else 
takes it and makes something inspired by it. Like, leap-frog or telephone.

if you could "respond" to anyone anywhere behind in the chain, you could use 
some of the previous work's design and create a different example of it. like, 
for example, a bunch of designers working on a project.

this person draws a telephone, that one draws a city block. next we have a 3D 
model of a cat, and then an animation of that cat licking it's toe beans. 
Someone in sound made a "mlem mlem" noise so they're syncing that up with the 
cat.

okay what if we had god rays and a cloud with thunderclaps - yeah good idea 
I'll start writing a shader for it cool cool yeah I'll see what the designers 
are up to.

=== later ===

right so we got a street fighter clone, a puzzle game using sliding blocks, a 
tetris with numbers or statistics or something I'm not really sure yet, and a 
couple more things that haven't really developed yet. That's pretty good right?

this is the project I was referring to, I think. Can't see how to host on their 
website so maybe I was wrong - it might need a bit more configuration than I 
made it seem.

that's the way WoW private hosting is, like you gotta compile the project and 
stuff.

did you know that every time you include a library in a project you're 
necessarily including all of the functionality that they have access to? Well, 
all that which you import. But once a function has been written for a 
functionality then there's no reason to write it again. Unless you're 
refactoring of course.

phew, sounds like a lot of spaghetti - YEAH IT IS. Spaghetti is fucking 
awesome, it's DELICIOUS OMG ahem I mean if you have collective seminars where 
you discuss the functionality that's relevant to certain parts that you and 
your team are working on, you can more easily be adept at applying them.

phew, sounds like a lot of thinking, not enough writing. Well, write then! 
Ideas are more spark when currently writing. : ) : )

"you cannot trust anything I say, so think of the ideas behind my words and

constitution, or even just the founding fathers.

I don't know if I ever changed any minds, but I represented my ideas as 
honestly and clearly as I could. I can't help but hope that some people saw 
them and considered them. Sometimes all it takes is a push, and they'll start 
thinking on their own. Like a thought that doesn't go away, they can't quite 
forget how they couldn't find the lie in what you spoke.

Or maybe I wanted to believe my actions had value. Post-hoc justification. Who

I dunno, from my perspective it's less about whether or not they're "unwitting" 
specifically and more like "lesser of two evils" - many of the republican 
people I knew in the past who were my age were utterly and absolutely convinced 
that if we didn't defend our homeland, somebody would come and kill us for it.

It didn't really matter who that other was, they were convinced that someone 
would do it. So they supported the military and opposed loosening restrictions 
on immigration (instead preferring tighter restrictions, but more quantity. As 
in, "let in more people but only if we KNOW they're cool")

I can't help but wonder if people join the military for the same reasons. Like 
standing atop the wall that divides "us" from "them", they put their backs to 
those they love and trust and face out toward whatever may come.

The military is a very diverse place. I know a lot of other people do it just 
because it seems like a good, honest job.

towers quite unlike her own, and lo! she wanted to wander amongst them, to and 
fro and off and beyond again.

she went once more to her master and said "master, if not my mind can I bear at 
least a voice?" and the master replied "yeah okay"

the turtle then sang from atop her cloud-mont vantage, and down in the villages 
and huddled around the hearthstones they who wore little for shells did listen 
and remember. For they knew the turtle better than she, and they knew her 
turmoil in a way that she could not see

One day the singing did stop, and they felt all alone on this pitiful rock. And 
when she remembered she sang no more, and though they forgot her, (eventually),

normality?

banality?

errrrr I mean emotional disregulation and low self esteem?

... it's easier in person when you can see when everyone has the "yo what the 
fuck" look on their face and when they have the "wait what was that I was 
thinking about snails" face

wish I could buy ramen noodle seasoning without the sodium. Like, the same

if you hit a plateau try doing more reps with less weight - it'll cover a 
blindspot you weren't working on. Then after a while you can do more weight 
again and it'll be easier because you'll have fast-twitch and slow-twitch 
muscles to support it

found some flowers by the garbage today. They brightened my day and floraled my 
window. I left some for the others who might want to take them to their loved 
ones, of which I have none who might see them. But I did take a few, to feel 
loved by myself. Thank you, kind stranger, who did feel fit to grace me with 
your bounty. Thank you kind stranger, for this ephemeral beauty. They smell 
nice.

we're pretty badass but like 90% of us are traumatized and that sucks. BUT 
we're good in a pinch and about 66% of us know how to fight, which is pretty 
cool I guess.

so much of our attempts to assist homeless people revolves around getting them 
fed, watered, housed, cleaned, and ready for work.

tell me again why we, in America, the land of the free, should not design our 
structures of society around the migratory patterns of tribes of people who 
care not for your homes of stone?

tell me again why every city is not a food forest, in addition to all the other 
things it claims to be?

ah, well, I guess you could just walk into a grocery store and take whatever 
you wanted. Sure would be nice if their continual operations did not depend on 
their capability to take from those who they serve in return for service.

What happened to public water fountains? Oh yeah people would wash their junk 
in them and then children would put their mouths on the spigots. Gross. No 
thank you.

hey remember when we would kick people out of our society and say "good luck 
with the sticks and mud"

cruel exile like that was an early form of eugenics. "you're not one of us 
because you smell" yikes.

if it exists within the borders of a state then it's utility is in service of 
the state

[wow what a fucking tankie]

if a person lives within a state then the utility of the state is in service of 
the person

[sounds like commie nonsense to me]

if a border exists in the land, drawn as a line by a hand in the sand, then 
that land now has a hand.

[i don't understand your poetry speak plainly]

no
