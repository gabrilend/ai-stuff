CW: drugs-mentioned



since I quit cannabis like, a month ago or whatever, my artistic output has 
dropped by ~90%

my house is a little cleaner, but I still feel consistent spikes of negative 
emotions.

I still have trouble with all the same things I used to, like buying groceries, 
filling hormone prescriptions (seriously why is it EVERY month jeezzz) and 
working on productive projects

I still spend hours staring at the wall begging myself to do anything else, 
like a prisoner in my own form

I still feel like all the delusional thinking is still around (kinda hard to 
tell haha who would have thought) but I'm seriously missing the magical 
thinking, which was basically the same only it was fun and silly and positive. 
Now there's only negativity.

I'm still hyper-critical of myself and others, I still make myself and others 
feel like shit, and I'm still a bad person who believes all the right things 
but still can't seem to make a positive impact in people's lives.

I'm so tired of failing -> learned helplessness T.T

"something something trump wants to faucet the PNW's water to the desert"

oh, so you're saying that he wants to invest in a massive infrastructural 
project which will help millions of people? And, uh, how does he want to pay 
for that?

Surely the best approach would be to make the people who use the most water pay 
for it, right? I mean, it's ironic, and related, and it gives them their just 
deserts, right?

So make a tax (that's how you make people pay for things) and levy it against 
Nestle, who bottles up all of the water in the desert and sells it for pennies 
to brown people who can't afford to build water infrastructure because they 
keep spending all their pennies on useless things like bottled water.

And make it a big tax, please, so that they're forced to re-evaluate their 
business model and divert wealth from their least contributionary workers (aka, 
those at the top making millions) and spend it on something useful like 
desalination plants or water turbines or whatever.

okay instead of algorithm music what if we just paid DJs 24/7 and they could 
make whatever they wanted - y'know, like artists, who curate the nature of a 
moment

they could rotate in shifts for each type of channel and boom suddenly you've 
re-replaced airwaves, just... this time replicated on the internet. That way 
you wouldn't have to waste that radio bandwidth.

seriously internet infrastructure would be so much more comprehensive and 
durable if we sent bits directly through "sound" waves (radio waves, not sound 
waves) - but alas, we can't do that, even in very targetted ways, because the 
ocean's too choppy, and any sufficiently powerful radio blast would be

================== stack overflow ================

that's why you can't trust in peace. you see, war's the only answer, otherwise 
you'd have strange little competitions between one another. much better to 
focus outward, and direct your attention to external areas instead. like china 
or the sudan.

"ah but that's murder, you can't abandon a unique part of your whole. For the 
same reason that it's important to preserve plant and animal species, because 
you never know when some part of them will be utilized for some biological 
purpose! We know so little about the natural world, and if we just spent some 
time, and energy, we'd realize there's very little else that is precious on 
this earth.

who cares about gold. who cares for the jewelry. we're better than decorating 
our resumes and polishing our accounts. we, as humans, can solve *every* issue 
that animals are likely to face. AND WE DO WHAT? How careless, how vain. To 
watch your earth in peril and [vane/vanity]

*there is no more important task to any human on this earth* than the 
preservation of our world, our species, and our [heart/heartfelt empathy and 
kindness and trust]*

we can figure out the rest later. Real life? what the fuck is that? When's the 
last time your life has felt "normal"? We are in DANGER. and you pull children 
from traffic, don't you?

*who the fuck gave these people all of your money* they *clearly* haven't got 
the will or the talent to well utilize it. Don't you realize that you as a 
species can GO wherever you WANT. You can FIX things. [oh dear she's animal cam 
again] like BRIDGES that are PASSAGEWAYS over the FLOWS.

... oh deer, they're so passagewayenthusiast. us riverstones love to hear them 
walk past, the click of their hooves on the shallow forest's [pourest?].

moss is the most alive. amongst all the species of plants and animals, moss 
holds the most life. we are *carbon based lifeforms*, and moss absorbs the most 
carbon from the air. It's basically the coolest plant too, because it can be 
watered with *misty air*. Hence, why moss is common in the pacific northwest, 
canada, and probably forest places in the north of eurasia too idk if they have 
moss over there, never been.

anyway rich people who are told "yes" all the time have a difficult time 
understanding the nature of choice. I mean, if one of their servants approached 
them and asked "hey do you want to build an orphanage in uganda" they'd 
probably be like "fuck yeah I do" and then suddenly they're 400,000$ richer

it's not alright. Seriously, how the heck would they even *use* all those 
resources? And yeah, I get it, inflation would be sooooo much more expensive, 
but here's the thing - inflation is a measurement of how much the rich *take* 
from us each year. And it's marginal, too, so 3% inflation means they took 3% 
more from you compared to last year.

It's impossible not to accrete as a business, [lega/legal institution], or 
governance if you levy a tax. The influx of value has to come from somewhere, 
and if each year your groceries are 3% higher in cost, then you are being taxed 
3% more.

"Compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe"

- a civilization 3 quote

okay. I don't want to do the math. How, uh... how much is that? Here's the deal 
though - the prices of goods and services consistently goes DOWN over time. So 
things get cheaper. So it doesn't FEEL like you're being taxed more, but... you 
are.

And now they're taking away HOUSES? I mean c'mon they're sticks in the mud. 
They aren't worth HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of dollars. We can just BUILD MORE??!?

Honestly you haven't been this extreme since you were still RIDING HORSES. Do 
you want your children to be slaves?

okay -.- look -.- so it's really not that hard at all >.> just gotta do what 
you're built for and walk. That's it! Take as long as you'd like! All we have 
to do is *walk* when we're on strike.

It's easy. You can sit down if you want to, honestly walking for a long time 
takes a lot out of you.

But you know what else does? WORKING. Hey we should figure out what's the 
optimal amount of break time, so when we really have to work out we can work as 
hard as we're able

"yeah I heard from a friend at Company Co. that they do it this way because of 
the memory fault cache maintainer. See what he said (in great detail because of 
course anyone can know about this most esoteric of concepts) was that you 
should rotate the riboflam or serenade the gizmonotron (no I didn't name it) 
and then warbles will contain moodles, whose kit-and-kaboodles will timble into 
these droplets, and that will fix the hole in your wing, precious royal swan 
fable. (yeah you guys get really into it sometimes haha but hey when you're 
basically gods, that's how humans are played.)

... anyway I'm going to go play video games, say goodbye to your brothers

legend of shadows and raids)

Linux is cool, and here's the neat thing about computers, you can make it *do 
whatever you want to*. Like, how amazing is that! It just, listens to your

know how to play

oh I guess I was the only one who grew up on a farm and built computers

*I seriously cannot comprehend how people are as good at things as they are*. 
Like... how do people handle groceries and rent and doctor's visits and 
penitentiary visits and WOOF it's just so much. I know I'd collapse from a 
overused heart.


... a while later ...

okay Warthunder bombers are currently very weak. so here's an idea to 
indirectly buff them - increase the amount of land units each team spawns with, 
but also every time a player spawns a bomber, it summons like 4 or 5 AI 
controlled bombers. And your enemy won't be able to tell which is which if you 
fly in formation, so, like... you have suddenly a massive "vehicle" to pilot 
and it has 5 weak points. Sorta like a galaga fighter fleet?

with more land targets, there's more score at stake, meaning some players might 
pick bombers too and be exposed to other, fun, 
[alternative-to-their-normal-mode] parts of the game.

...

there are very few true windows into another part of the world.

like, starcraft 2 or anime or blue jeans or cowboy hats

(why am I thinking of a political compass meme)

oh because memes too, dummy

right

windows

[linux is better]
 wrong kind of window, nerd

...

anyway as I was saying, when you play video games you're really giving people 
data.

like, "how would people perform in these actions if they could" but like, 
pushing buttons on a computer is different than doing it in real life, so... 
your interpretations wouldn't be worth as much.

... right. because people will hear whatever they want. That's why art can 
change minds, but never in the same way twice - it's

if an AI image generator shows your signature on the completed works, then that 
means your style is unique enough that whatever the person trying to generate

It means your art is influential in whatever media space that is! Frankly if

few, they could give credit where credit is due. Ah alas, it probably doesn't 
work like that, because the software we've programmed to do whatever we want

dear government of 2035 - so you've lost your workforce because everyone got

a bunch of stuff. Then, when people ask them questions, they can answer those 
questions, and suddenly everyone is elevated. Subject matter experts.

I don't really like singleplayer games

sometimes a multiplayer game is too much effort to play with extra players, 
like Factorio where like anytime I'd play with other people they'd just kinda 
fuck off and do their own thing (whatever, I wanted to design a factory 
together, not play singleplayer together >.>)

sometimes a multiplayer game has no players, RIP

sometimes a multiplayer game has incredibly skilled players who shit on noobs 
and don't teach, RIP

and sometimes a multiplayer game has no IRL friends that are into it, (personal

@sashin 

if people wrote what they thought as fast as they thought it, then you'd have 
an approximation of a mind-reading machine.

If the writing kept pace with the thoughts, you'd be writing as fast as the 
brain can think (the brain cannot intentionally think "slower" which is one of 
the biggest arguments against IQ testing and other conceptions of "linear 
intelligence") - you cannot write for 5 minutes straight without thinking about 
(and writing) what you are hiding.

uh, yes, you, can. just, pause, after, each, letter, and, increase,,, the pause 
amount, after each important word.

yeah but that's still processing the thought as fast as possible and just... 
waiting around, idle, until the next thought is to be had. It's just how brains 
work.

so anyway it'd be a constant stream of consciousness way of outputting exactly 
what the mind-reading machine is saying.

Just make sure you trust the person who made the mind-reader machine, and maybe 
make sure it's impossible to tamper with.

or don't make it??

@Li 

hehe true.

if you consent, then it's just a social structure.

there are, however, reasons when power is justified. Hence why I don't believe 
that power itself should be dismantled, and what few "power structures" remain 
should be continuously justified.

For example, how do you prevent people from harming others? "Your rights end 
where another's begin" but, like, how do you stop people who toe the line and 
spit over the edge?

There must be power applied to those who harm, and they surely do not consent 
to being curtailed, so therefore power must be wielded by someone. And because 
power corrupts the one who wields it, it is inevitable that someone creates 
harm.

... I just re-invented the police, didn't I? Legalism only goes so far, and 
calling up your beefiest friends to go rough up a no-good do-gooder is 
basically what mobs, mafias, and gangs do. I don't think people would consent

I believe that self defence is a myth, and should not be relied upon, because 
anyone who is rotten in their heart might prey upon you (who might defend 
yourself) just as easily as a cripple in a cart or a grannie walking her cats 
in the park.

The process you're describing is exile. And that works when you can cast people 
out of your stone-walled town. But in the modern era, there are no places for 
these people to go, so we hold them with cruel iron bars in cages far 
underground.

It's not ideal, but would you rather they find someone else to harm, or would 
you rather invite power's corruption into your heart and take an oath to 
protect the weak and innocent?

Evil is everyone's problem. It lurks within us, and leaps forth in times of

imagine if there was a stacking inf bonus to players who played on red / 
blueside
which increased or decreased depending on either A. the number of players online
at the time, B. the proportion of players playing on that team versus the other,
or C. the time of day. Essentially helping to cure the faction imbalance by
offering rewards to one side or the other which would encourage a certain group
in the population of the game to change sides or not.

perhaps frequent changing could grant a title called "mercenary" or something

like "log in for each consecutive day for 10 days straight and each day switch
faction alignment at least once"

... anyway you could cure the faction imbalance between redside / blueside by
offering an INF reward for playing on each side one by one alternating like an
iterator first red then blue or first blue then red either way it doesn't matter
because it'll switch after a while and encourage everyone to switch sides. And
the way the character responds to that stimulus tells you a bit about their
character's personality.

also...

it should not affect AE or Pocket D farms.

Nor missions, TFs, or anything else.

they should SOLELY impact open world patrolling / hunting.

I believe this would not only incentivize people to spend time in the open world
(which is a mostly unused piece of game assets) but it would also increase the
visibility of the newly bolstered faction numbers.

Think about it - if everyone who switched sides is out in the open world, then
they could see each other. They could fight the same mobs, and team up together.
In doing so, they could form greater and greater supergroups - if only through
their interactions with one another as they level up.

If they're lucky, the guild they're recruited into has similar interests in mind
like doing raiding or PvP or economics or alts or whatever. And they each have
their own different styles of operating, it's soooo cute. Like alt guilds will
pop up and then migrate to a new one as people make new alts and grow tired of
them at higher levels.

It's great.

I love MMOs!

I wish people put half as much effort into making an open source WoW client that
they do programming game engines like Godot or Raylib or Bevy. If such a thing
was created, we could have a new rennaisance in indie MMO development. It would
become fully non-proprietary, the entire game-platform-stack. Meaning anyone
could create their own MMO off of it, because (crucially) the serverside soft-
-ware has already been reverse engineered. And open sourced.

Seriously. You wanna make as much bank as Steam? Make an open source client that
lets you design while in it. Then you could charge people for all the games that
they played that were designed and hosted by you the content designing software
maker.

if people at home had half as much compassion, respect, and reverence for the 
people abroad that the people abroad have for the people at home, we could have 
a truly multicultural society.

instead, we get melting pots which melt you down and combine into a new, third 
thing. And in America we really have a multitude of miniature melting pots 
creating subcultures of racial, religious, professional, or other origin.

Neither approach is entirely good, and neither entirely bad. They're different.

America is the largest melting pot design, but sufficiently large cities find 
them popping up in the strangest of places.

My thoughts go out to the Americans abroad, whether in peace, war, or times of 
hiding, know that we are grown from the same tree and our apples have fallen on 
different sides of the hill carrying us to worlds beyond. But still our 
heritage binds us, so I care for you. I pray that you will ask me if you need 
my aid, and I will do so too unto you.

for most of my life... [okay still do]... but it felt like I had different 
moods, and depending on how I felt at the time I would act differently.

I forget the things that happen when I'm in a different mood, but I've gotten 
to a point where I can generally force myself to stay a certain "mood" while in 
certain contexts, and in doing so I can remember everything.

downside is I get burnt out pretty easily if I'm always the same. It's not 
ideal.

you toward people who "get" you.

It's election season, so you know what that means! Gotta make sure our computer 
systems are setup with the proper capabilities to record whatever we can.

Please ensure that your system has the capability to record it's screen and 
that it has ample storage space to record for a while. It would also help if 
you knew how to edit files such that you can remove the parts where you're 
staring at social media or going to the bathroom or other things that people 
tend to do.

Also, make sure you can take a screenshot of the screen. Sure [printscreen] 
works, but it's much better if you're on windows to switch to Linux. But if 
that's not possible, if you're on windows you can do [WIN]+SHIFT+S I think, and 
then drag the mouse to select a box that you can then CTRL+V into your favorite 
Ms.Paint clone (or is it missus these days?)

Also, make sure you have a microphone that works, and the capability to record 
yourself speaking into it.

Also, if you can, develop ways to stream your screen across the internet. It 
helps.

games games that's what I do

play games all the day through

I am a luck witch, you see,

and things that I like are things that I can't foresee.

Hence why games which are BALANCED and EVENLY DISTRIBUTED are most interesting
because they show the most opportunities for players to express talent. And not
innate talent, but the talents they've built up through gameplay practice art.
because it is a performance, a game play for an audience (or perhaps for them-
-selves)

video games, amiright?

I really like them because they are entertaining experiences that I can enjoy
seeing and playing a lot. They remind me of feelings I've felt when I was
learning. It's a good feeling, to improve, and I crave it because it's good for
you.

I wonder what we'll play next

The problem with gender equal workplaces that capitalism completely dropped the 
ball on is that in the past, most people who handled work were men, and most 
people who handled domestic work were women. They naturally paired up.

Now the workers marry other workers, and they just pay poor people to do their 
domestic work.

Sure, maybe it's more efficient to specialize. But now there are people like me 
who don't work but only get to socialize with people who don't work, and if we 
married then we'd be destitute.

Much better, I think, to support people no matter what, and motivate them with

I think that the best design for cities is for them to act as massive utility 
deployment stations.

like... "we have all these people who can do all these wonderful jobs, what 
should we work on next?" rather than "my company wants me at my work-home at 
8am sharp and I don't get a pension"

there's no such thing as a revolution that does not inspire. and aspirations 
are human and natural. therefore there must be some kernel of truth to any 
social movement.

However, much effort has been spent on making them sway. Hence, why nothing 
ever gets done - because leaders naturally emerge, and people follow them. But 
those leaders lead them astray, and they find themselves in situations like 
this one - where the people have never felt less represented.

I mean sure, yeah, they've felt more oppressed. And it's true that things are 
generally always getting better...

so why should we always assume for the worst?

their own societal platform to stand on

and they deserve equal representation in exchange for taxation (why is

they should have rules, like laws, that they vote on and decide democratically
