honestly, how hard could it  be to set up a basic youtube replacement which 
gave 100% of the ad revenue (togglable by the viewer) directly to the video 
creator and charged a subscription to both the creators and the viewers / 
single fee from the guests to pay for the AWS infrastructure or whatever 
generic platform upon which it is hosted might be.

probably accomplishable in less than a year and maybe a thousand human-hours, 
if they know what they're doing. Make it 2 if they don't.

profit is evil because once it's built, it's been made, and it'll never go 
away. Not in the internet age and day. So why bother with the gross product and 
revenue essentials? build something, then leave it alone and trust that it'll 
stay sharp. Honestly, just let the users build upon the source-code, so they 
can add security improvements or open holes for security bugs so they can be 
paid to make security improvements. not too hard, but also not your problem, so 
build it and then move on.

to help cool down in arid environments, have water dripping from a faucet onto 
a wet towel or cloth. Then when you pass by you can wipe down and it's super 
refreshing. Can do a sponge or paper towel too if you want.

this helps keep the air moist because the water will slowly evaporate from the 
driest parts of the cloth instead of rolling down a drain-pipe-hole and going 
into the ocean.

moist air is cool air. Helps if you live somewhere with increased air pressure, 
like a valley or a coast.

especially with wind. not too much, otherwise it gets sandy, just enough to 
feel nice when the sweat is upon your back.

"but what about all the other places that aren't perfect?"

oh, well, different places require different adjustments to the environment.

if you want to build an alibi, do something strange and consistent like smoking 
some random drugs from a homeless guy's encampment and then going between the 
four corners of an intersection and it's sidewalk for a day or two. Surely, 
someone's gonna drive by with a dash-web-cam, and they can take a picture as 
they pass by. Boom, dated for this time and place, there's your space.

downside is, if the people watching you see you on the same path all day, they 
might watch you too. So sometimes in roughly optimized ratios it's better to do 
so even if you don't need to be seen in a time and place in a way that seems 
commonplace.

walk to work? great, that sounds fun.

(nobody wants to do that)

(also falsifying alibis is a crime)

okay, so... don't do that. Just... trust that SOMEONE will drive past with a 
dash-web-cam, and maybe it'll find it's way to you if you ever need it in a 
court of law or otherwise. lots of ways to have a court. you know if your peers 
hang out in your court, they become your courtiers...

I feel that frugality and productivity should be valued in equal regard.

A person who conserves should be valued just the same as a person who 
progresses.

Yet we find ourselves in a capitalist system which demands the production of 
dollars to spend on rent, mortgages, groceries, bill payments, 
land-value-taxes, and all the other things besides.

Would it not be better to ensure the grovetender has a space to sleep? The 
recycler has enough to eat?

What of the mothers? Their children are their charges, they should worry less 
about financials.

What of the artists? Their visions and imagined creations are worth more than 
their time working at a bank or a grocery store.

Open source programming is the bedrock of all technology. It is not rewarded.

There are countless examples besides. Give people the means to produce and they 
will - give people the means to maintain and they will.

Currently, people have the means for neither. Only corporations and the few 
with wealth have the means to produce or conserve - everyone else just works in 
their sweatshops.

it's trivial to run a C compiler inside of a lua interpretation of a script. 
And vice versa - you could totally run lua functions from C. Just point to the 
spot in memory where they're stored / operating, and call 
"update_class_exhibitor_type_d()" and the linker will come along and say "huh 
this looks like something from this library that's part of the requirements up 
above" (the "includes" section is where you say which files include the 
functions you're going to be calling) and in this particular case it would see 
that you need to start up a lua interpreter inside of the [either compiler or 
running program I can't remember] to properly execute the function of the 
function that you're pointing at with a lua-pointer style data object which is 
part of a struct that stores all the other lua functions in a spot in memory.

whenever I talk to capitalists (who actually have money and aren't larping wage

with capitalism is to make a million or more dollars by making a company, and 
then using that million dollars to buy houses for people I care about.

I ask "what about the rest of the people, the ones I don't know?"

their response typically boils down to "if you don't know them, then why should 
you care? fuck 'em"

It's never about hope or change. They want to change the world to make it 
cooler, not kinder. generally.

WERE great when they wielded power. Now they are bureaucratic and listless,

what if all the followers on your profile who only know you through the 
fediverse (after having known each other in person, this part is crucial) who 
don't talk anymore were like, killed and replaced with someone who is always 
busy

so many people just... disappear from things

where did they go

why is their chair empty or filled with another

why can't I place their name

what kind of clothes did they wear

oh right they had such-and-such 
boots-or-piece-of-adorn-jewelry-handheld-possession-just-the-same-shape-as-someo
ne-i-knew

then I heard they gave them to so-and-so so that they could wear them for clout

ah, well, I guess they're busy, got stuff going on, things to write about 
today... Guess I better hear the story, what's the news, ah, well, okay, guess 
I'll go back to programming.

why the heck would partners need each other for anything

if you a ren't instable on your own, then it'll cause harm if your partner 
leaves you. which technically qualifies as abuse, so you should assert efforts 
to disengage that hold you have on them by workong on your long struggles and 
love struggles and longing struggles so that they can make moves of their own 
and you can orbit each other in life.

IT SHOULD BE NORMAL TO LIVE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. The more space the 
better, but still with nothing inbetween.

yeah, sure, let's build more houses.

why don't we build habitat around them? it'd cut down on the necessary space 
required if places which were natural but not really all that sacred were 
converted into mixed-species homing grounds

... don't humans leave like, trash on the street once a week? sounds like a bad 
idea if you got pandas and raccoons rifling through each other's baggage.

there are people who have been fighting bosses their whole lives. I personally 
play a Paladin, though also a wit

what if programs just checked the current state of the program against their 
past memory of it every time their looping functions got to the end of a new 
kind of while loop which checked the previous state of all the variables in the 
system as compared to the arguments of the function that is called by the new 
kind of while loop which look exactly the same as the last memory of the 
program. Okay. Let's write it to RAM and then start working on the next one. 
Once we run out of space or the operating system needs more, we can relinquish 
the oldest ones. The idea is to store state after all which could be 
programmatically checked to make sure it didn't change underneath our feet. 
Then you pretty much wouldn't need to worry about buffer overflows or 
cybersecurity incidents at all...

after all, it's only read only. what's the harm in reading our tax 
documentation?

anyway, something about functional programming languages like lisp passing the 
entire state of the program to each recursion...if you use that kind...

the biggest lie of Warcraft is that the nations of Azeroth wouldn't find common 
ground while fighting each other over peace.

Maybe a Tauren or Night Elf wanted to fight for the Horde. Or perhaps a Goblin 
and a Human decide to strike out on their own, making their own little auction 
house for their guild of adventurers and author-engineers who wrote quests and 
dialogue in a DM sorta way

[oh great she's describing another Azerothcore server that nobody's gonna make 
ever because if they did then they'd waste time on someone else's property]

how's that custom engine coming along?

... still uses prototype art? are you kidding me? ah, well, okay, let's write 
it off as a loss.

what do you mean technical debt? I don't understand why you can't just pay it 
off and move on. We gotta keep up, I heard so-and-so's got this-or-that feature 
that is killer in the press. Yeah, killer. Like it's so goodcool it'd kill us 
if it saw us walking alone at night in a skimpy dress. Huh? That doesn't happen

Game designers should reward players for playing multiplayer games, not for 
being good at playing multiplayer games.

They should still have a ranking, and matchmake against similarly skilled foes, 
while also putting high level players amongst low level players occasionally 
(and fairly, so maybe one on each team "smurf" style) in order to both teach 
the low level players and let the high level player have catharsis.

When players are rewarded for being good, they stop playing the game to enjoy 
it. That's fine, but both pickup games and NBA can exist at once and its not 
due to the logistics of organizing a large group of skilled basketball players. 
It's not always about skill.

By rewarding players for the number and quality of games they play, (so, no 
afk-ing or throwing outside of being drunk or whatever) not only can you 
increase engagement but also you encourage low-level and low-skill players to 
compete just as much. Especially if you tell them "hey, we'll match you up with 
people who have similar gameplay habits to you. Give it a bit though because 
the system needs to be calibrated to your particular spirit"

@FantasticalEconomics 

it's not that they lost value in their company due to the lack of sale of their 
products, but instead because they don't have to pay for marketing if their car 
looks "cool" enough and they can give them away for a lower blood price

all encryption algorithms should open up as much configurability to their 
processing as possible.

"hmmm, do I want N/A or otherkin?"

this would increase the variance in their outputs, essentially maximizing the 
attack surface beyond the capability of any de-cryption hacker, who suddenly 
has to try infinitely more possible combinations.

that feeling when you're working on a large piece of software which has the 
capability to process in advance which operations will go in what order (a form 
of constant re-compilation) and schedules tasks like an operating system, to be 
executed on one of many individual threads.

your filemanager probably has a thread for a moment, then passes it back, 
waiting it's turn to be updated while you're messing around on Inkscape or 
writing something in Neovim or running neofetch 256 times in order to find the 
best background to go along with it or whatever it is people do when using 
computers

the task scheduler meanwhile has the glorious opportunity to work at a higher 
level of abstraction, managing each individual process and learning bits and 
pieces of what needs to be processed next. It all gets put on a list, and 
whenever a new thread comes up to be available it can point it toward one of 
those in the list of tasks to be executed by the task executor who works on a 
schedule and laughs externally in wintertime~

I want computer scientists to do computer science, and let the marketing people 
figure out how to sell it.

... um, that was weird, anyway as I was saying, lots of people getting thrown 
off the tech industry right about nowaboutsince. wonder if they might want to 
do some of the stuff they initially pursued the field by being trained in. 
probably would, and we could probably break problems down into academic 
solutions, which we could use to address any issuehappenstance which might form.

mean have you seen a data c3nter's power bill these days? jeezzzz]

highly suggest you view your steam library by [alphabetical/most-recent] 
sometime. whichever resonates most with you, the reader, the one who is reading 
this and possibly resonating about a reminder to view your data such as number, 
type, and name of steam games in different formats, such as a list organized 
alphabetically or a list organized most-recently, to remind about what games 
you have (scrolling to a random spot in the list if you have enough to have a 
scroll) and might be interested in playing or luckily happen-stancing, to share 
a moment with some other person on the other side of the world which might be 
just out in your backyard who is also playing that game at the same time.

hair" or "coming prepared" or "prepared to come" which is slightly different]

what if I played video games instead of typing keyboards to the internews?

does anyone actually read anything or do they just use it to post

red is a girl color and blue is a boy color because white people added white to 
make it rosayy and aquamarillion.

but red is a girl color and blue is a boy color because girls BLEED, and boys 
watch the clouds go by

and red is a girl color because red is the color of the earth, sometimes 
browner like shit, sometimes lighter like fingernails, but always red.

and blue is a girl color because she only likes to dance with flowers in her 
hair and the sun dappled waterlillies shimmering sparkling radiance across the 
water-lit scene.

and blue is a girl color because boys and girls and etceteras each have similar 
shapes at night, when the world is blue-for-life. I know I'd rather reside in 
the sunlight.

in perfect blue does the darkness grew, and forthwith and anon came it's power. 
pale blue is a mockery of sunlights lost child, who spurned it's sight since 
before there was time.
