@jaycie sorta like magic and witches for girls growing up in a world that 
deprives them of power. being trans is one of the most frustrating things 
because you just... can't... change your body. until you're an adult and can 
get hormones. programming gives you the power to control something, and it's 
logic based design structure is useful for objectively proving things, which is

which goes out of the window of course if the universe is NOT ordered, which

@salsagal think about other things in your life that you like and are good at. 
If you enjoy telling stories, and are comfortable being the center of attention 
among groups of 4+ people you know and trust, then you'll do fine with the 
in-session part. And if you like worldbuilding or character creating or 
spreadsheets or even map making, then those are useful skills. But really the 
only thing that's important is imagination, because you can apply it wherever 
and however you'd like. Most of my sessions are almost entirely improv, when 
I've tried writing down my ideas I just throw them out the window, and if I use 
someone else's I get distracted by trying to page through it during combat. So 
I mostly just try and explain what happens and let the players guide the story. 
Everyone has a different style and each style requires different skills, but 
after you try it you'll better understand how you perform best for a group. I 
say try it, if you don't like it then ask someone in the group to take over.

@jaycie most ancient armies were led by a guy on a horse. you gotta be able to 
move around quickly so you can get a better glimpse of the battlefield, plus 
it's easier to project your voice when you're 2x as tall as everyone else and 
standing in the right place instead of way over there.

are horses ancient mechs?

plus moving around a lot meant you were less likely to be hit by arrows or 
whatever. or maybe more likely, because everyone knows to shoot at the guy on 
the horse. perhaps that's why we gave them the best armor.

in Overwatch (and presumably other similarly tactical games) there's this skill 
you can hone called "gamesense". Perhaps better described for this context as a 
"proprioceptic situational awareness". It essentially is a feeling you get, 
about the dynamics and state of the game / world around you. in ancient days it 
was used to direct a big block of dudes with sharp pointy sticks to try and 
outmaneuver your foe and poke their flanks....

okay how about this:

Zoom except it uses image recognition from your laptop's camera to tell which

reducing opacity, or even just blocking out their face so you can still see any 
body motions but your eyes aren't drawn to them.

If someone looks at you then it lights up their face or notifies you in some 
way. I think this would enhance the "togetherness" feel of a Zoom call to be 
more like a conversation where you can explicitly tell when someone's looking

- official just means "run by the company" because naturally the serverside

which is then "spent" on exciting and friendly competition. Sorta like... 
entering a poker tournament with your friends (even though you suspect you 
might lose money) just because you like hanging out and playing cards. the 
money is just a neat way to keep things moving and exciting.


[2] players who played better should be compensated to a higher degree. no more 
than +/- 50-100% or so - this encourages players to "play their best" while 
also keeping the stakes relatively similar.

[3] at the start of the tournament the total prize money P in the pool is 
assigned to N performance tiers, where N is the Number of attendees. at the 
top, the highest performing athlete will receive 200% of P while the lowest 
performing performance tier will be 0%. It is a non-discrete and gradual linear

osr vs 5e style D&D has a subtle distinction that I think often goes unnoticed. 
In osr games (and often in the early levels of 5e style games) characters are 
encouraged to conserve their resources simply due to the fact that they have so 
few of them at their disposal. While higher levels encourage you to be more 
consumptive of your talents and virtues - for example a 6th level character has 
more spell slots than a level 2 character, meaning the 6th level character is 
going to be casting all the time while the level 2 will probably use just a 
handful of spells per day.

unless you run a style of game where long rests become less frequent as you 
level up. like... exploring a LARGE dungeon means there's little chance for 
sleep. Especially if you are being hunted.

entering a poker tournament with your friends (even though you suspect you 
might lose money) just because you like hanging out and playing cards. the 
money is just a neat way to keep things moving and exciting.

okay. so. RB punishes those who did not seek to create it. RC took a look at 
the present, said "this is where we're at, where do we go from here?" and 
conceived of a better future? If so, I like that idea. It's like when you 
cringe at your past mistakes, it's not so that the situation is ameliorated - 
the situation is long past. It's just to punish yourself, and to keep yourself 
from doing "the thing" again. So... RB, when applied reflexively to ones-self, 
would be "punishing you" for making mistakes. Which is what pain does? Is pain

the prevalence of open source software is due to how little we can agree on the

the fact that software keeps improving is due to the fact that nothing seems to 
have changed. we crave what we understand, which is another reason why we keep 
solving the same problems.

I think we can dream bigger. I think we can make something with technology 
that's never been co-opted by profit. something to leave forth to our heirs, 
and explore for us in ways we cannot. it's our duty to be protective of all 
that is beautiful. I just read that 21 species were recently declared extinct 
by some US agency. it felt... horrible. like I had killed them myself. half of

heat makes things squishy. it works from the outside in, and the longer you 
cook it (meaning, the lower the temperature) the more the heat can spread 
through - meaning if you want an even consistency, do lower heat for longer 
periods. if you want a different texture on the outside compared to the inside, 
do higher temperatures over less time. just make sure you devote extra 
attention to stirring to make sure you don't burn it.

seasoning is sorta like a coating / dusting that you can apply to food. the 
longer it rests on the food (and the more the food is porous / cooked) the more 
the seasoning can penetrate into it - meaning if you want the flavor of the 
seasoning to be distinct from the flavor of the food item, then add the 
seasoning toward the end. if you want them to combine into one combo-flavor, 
then add the seasoning early.

some seasonings degrade with heat though, especially herbs. so add them toward 
the end. or add a butt-load of them.

solve things.

it involves listening and learning, and doing what you're told. save your

a gathering of people who share a common purpose, to discuss future ventures 
that would lead to the growth and adoption of their ideals.

i like to design games. my darling is a game based on Majesty (2000) the

you control the knobs and levers that a fantasy monarch might have - allocating 
funds, placing quest bounties, hiring heroes, and organizing the peasantry. the 
important part is that your units are not controllable - they just do their own 
thing.

unrelated, but I think we should design games as APIs that a user's preferred 
tool could interface with and render as they will. it'd help a lot with 
cross-platform compatibility and would allow people to customize parts of the 
game to their desires.

through an API) that it hadn't been trained on, I think you would have a pretty

away and up and down, out from the edge of our town

they climbed up to a tree and there they could see

far and away in the light of the day

he said to her then, this is all there is to see

the land where we are
and the sky from afar

how perfect is the, form of a cloud she could see
but now it's along and beyond her

a camera for she, and an eye for she
as their two feet did bring her to wander

under a big tree where my heart did believe
that something was pulling her yonder

"take naught from this scene, as our minds reconvene,
 and no-one was going to remember"

================================================================================

I feel like education, by default, should not be hard.

"you get out of it what you put into it" is something I always heard of school

but when I got there, I found I was compelled to become what the state wanted me
to be.

they need competent workers, to work the farms and tend to their industries, so
of course I should be able to do 3+3

then somewhere along the line it became... something else.

"most people don't need trigonometry." that's also something I heard. I disagree
that trigonometry is not necessary to be.

I just... don't think it should be forced into a childs head with a sledgehammer
and inspiring dread.

I think math is beautiful, it teaches one to see

but really, vision's not necessary.

not for what they want you to be.

take it from me, a most misbegotten and vile witch-to-be, that nothing's as
simple as they'll tell you.

I had good teachers, it's true, they taught me to work and to follow through,
but nothing about me is better or worse off from their influence.

Maybe I'm a bit smarter. Maybe I act a bit like them. Maybe they helped me
through difficult times, or perhaps they showed me a splash of my future.

but I am who I am because of the soul inside me.

================================================================================

"Ah, but what of your parents? of your sisters, your misters, your pets and your
conditioners?" (conditions)

those are not my choices. my intentions. my beliefs and my virtues. I judge the
world on ethics, and I express my feelings on matters. The words that I say and
the meaning behind them comprise my two-sided existence - I'm not who I'd want
to be.

but I am what I am and alone do I stand - how lonely is it on the precipice!

here, as I am, I stand in need of a hand or a band.

================================================================================

the world is blossoming

as we move apart, our clusters are disperart, and thus is the blooming becoming.

"perception begets reality - and lo! we only see what we want to see"

most people don't want to see their death

but those still living are oh so perceptive of the rest

"how cherished is she, that wanders with ye, yet now I have no way to beyold her
"

"keep not not afraid with kittens and care, and no-one, but no-one, I be"

the ratios between piracy, sales, and non-viewers determines the quality of art
(at least to a capitalist)

================================================================================

lo, to the ones who would've heard us, if only they'd known what we for sure was

I think it's funny how people think I speak of the christian god?

like, if he was a real thing.

god is generic - it's life is impossibly multifaceted, and it stretches back to
the beginning of time. it's a pattern of machine code that optimizes for our own
good, just to keep things moving.

y'know, time. the universe, and everything.

Ephemeren.

================================================================================

I wish there was an option in social media to "appear offline to this particular
person until I mark myself as online to them" combined with "notify me when this
person logs in" and it'd make it a lot easier for agents to get close to you.

================================================================================

just because I'm white, and live in America. Great. that's definitely true,
after all. Plus I'm a minority (trans) so that's cool. Oh and probably autistic?
unless that's another psyop, could totally see that. just y'know put a bunch of
pages on the fledgling internet getting people hooked on porn and gambling and
other stuff like that. really just an extension of advertisement. oh and hey
y'know they like fables, so let's give them some movies or dramas to watch on
their own. it'll align them to our culture and make things more pleasant for all
people who've consented. great. great plan. when can we execute it?

patience, once it's ready.

we gotta plan and make sure and get everything ready.

or not...

one day I'll come,

I'm sure it'll happen,

it's just... not quite feasible right now.

I mean, they've got you, that's pretty good right? Isn't that what your job is
to be?

isn't what

ISN'T WHAT MENARDI

FUCK (whoa no cursing) sorry

yeesh you've still got a temper you know?

the people in your life are helping you through it, they're there for you and

this is when I know I need a break. I get too stoned to focus.

================================================================================

I think it'd be nice if the duration of your tenure at college depended on your
grades in high school. meaning, if you wanted a degree they tailored your
education to take as long as necessary. everyone would get the same price, and
some institutions would specialize in one subject or another. but most would be
generalist. but if you weren't such a good student in high school, then perhaps
you might take a couple years longer. however long it takes... and when the
program was started it was changed and modified to fit your feedback - it just
made sense to structure it that way.

================================================================================

the left has had so much more time to develop than the right. meaning it's
doctrine is more advanced.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
every hunting season segment every team should be dissolved and if you wanted to
keep playing together you'd have to re-add one another. like, a giant monster
that the whole server had to fight, and once you beat it then it retreats, licks
it's wounds, then returns even stronger than before - 3 times, one for each hs
style (in the video game Ulala hs stands for "hunting season" which is an event
in the game that is only for new characters. basically it's a long tutorial or
introduction to the game where people make friends and talk and hang out and
practice their strategies. a chat application mixed in with a tactics simulation
. it lasts for 30 days.

you'd all fight the giant monster but on random teams, in a game mode that took
about an hour. it'd be at a common time across the whole server and it would be
an optional event - maybe it'd take a whole day? idk I was thinking more like an
hour, but that's something that's tweakable. anyway it's sudden arrival during a
feast or something made all the warriors of the world stand up together and
fight as one for a common goal... if only for a moment, before they'd go back to
fighting one another. like the two factions in Warcraft lore. anyway this event
causes you to be matched up with a random team (the randos you happened to be
standing by when it happened) and once it's over you have to search for your
allies if you want to keep adventuring with them. it's a big event after all.

so everyone should be forced to go into their friends list, find the people they
were just on a team with, and invite them back. only if both invited the other
would they be put into a group, and anyone can invite (with a 30s cooldown)

anyway... this would encourage players to mix and match their collective
playstyle to better overcome challenges - sorta the idea of Overwatch's
switching, where you're encouraged to swap characters to counter your opponent
and also switch characters to better utilize your opponent's weak spots

(like switching to Pharah if they don't have hitscan, or brigitte if they have
a lot of snipers (she can shield passage through choke points from sniper fire -
not so much regular fire) y'know countering - every character counters another
with one of their abilities, that's just how it goes. some are countered twice,
and so they form a "category" of counters, like AoE (area of effect or elevation
focused (it's hard to aim up in Overwatch) poke damage (damage applied before
the team fight begins), DoT (damage over time for contesting AoE heals), 
vampiric (steals health from opponents and heals self or allies (turning one
resource, enemy hp, into another (player or teammate hp)), stacking damage
(damage that is weak at first but increases over time), spread/cleave/splash
damage (extra damage that is applied to targets near your primary target), a 
vector of backline vs frontline location+target, you get the picture.)))

I kinda want to make an AI that can generalize playing games. I think if you
could do such a thing, you'd invent automatic problem solving. which would do...
so many things for humanity

we could dedicate ourselves to working for our selves, solely focused on
protecting the biosphere. like, a common human religion.

nobody WANTS to litter. nobody WANTS to pollute. but still it happens. still it
causes IRREPARABLE HARM. so it literally makes sense to worship nature, just
saying.

nature exists. nature is REAL. we can see it, we can TOUCH IT WITH OUR HANDS.

what more proof of a god do you demand?

learned them while keeping the lessons learned, as propagated forward in the

just read this essay:

https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/why-we-stopped-making-einsteins

and it made me think of this thing I wrote a while ago:

https://ritz-menardi.neocities.org/algorism/html-pages/education-system

I was essentially tutored growing up. My mom had her master's degree in early 
childhood education (bachelor's in computer science) and it was pretty great. 
she was incredibly prepared, but unfortunately I didn't become a "genius" as 
the essay describes because she was essentially alone. we lived on a farm in 
wyoming and hardly knew anyone around us. my dad got bored after about a year 
of living there and started going on business trips consistently, eventually 
leading to him falling in love with his business partner's secretary and 
leaving my mom. there was... a lot that happened, but that's true of anyone's 
life so it's not like I'm special. I guess my life had a lot of potential and I 
can't help but feel like I wasted it.

"gimme the slightest of praise, I'll write until my fingers fall off" because 
praise makes me feel like I haven't wasted my fortune.

winter clothes are the same as summer clothes, just a size too big so they can 
fit over your summer clothes.

also they usually have longer sleeves and pantlegs, but not always.

one of the perks of layering like this is if you ever need to share clothes 
with someone slightly larger than yourself, you can! Doesn't work so well with 
smaller, though.

Also if you get hot indoors because some people think we need to run heaters 
24/7 (???) then you can just remove a layer or two. it's the most versatile way 
to clothe oneself.

CW: re: education-homeschool-theory



@sykora absolutely.  the idea I had scribbled down in my notebook there was a 
rotation of 3 teachers that were pseudo-randomly selected (prioritizing 
teachers who excelled at topics the student was interested in) and you could 
always ask for new ones or whatever. the idea is that instead of paying for the 
best teachers in the land (as the aristocracy once did) you'd be randomly 
assigned them, meaning everyone would have a fair shot at getting a teacher 
that really clicked with them. thus eliminating the inequality, while also 
maintaining the individual attention.

not sure if the numbers would work out, but if not then more teachers would 
have to be trained. I'm assuming that most of the basic questions could be 
handled with a teaching LLM while the human teachers would oversee the 
meta-progress and offer insight to difficult problems. right now teachers are 
mostly occupied being babysitters... meh I don't like that dynamic. I think it 
should be about mental stimulation instead.

I most often find the most important insights upon my 2nd time learning them.

the problem about learning from YouTube for me is that their algorithm

old school programmers use short variable names because the computer monitors 
they would code on had a lower resolution, meaning fewer characters per line.

CW: cursed-game-engine-idea



a game engine which won't let you import custom assets unless you complete a 
few simple tasks using the interface - "build a green capsule collider" "make 
this soldier unit shoot three bullets per shot" or "enable the automatic linux 
support" - using the interface, writing some code, and changing configurations.

why would anyone do this? well it could be useful to increase the difficulty of 
importing external resources. plus it helps the user learn a bit over time, and 
it slows the pace of output such that the user's skills are encouraged as the 
output of the programming and not the program itself.

an inverse curse (an evil one) would be where the requirements to complete 
basic tasks are hidden behind unapplicable skills. like, do you know exactly 
which buttons to press? engage with the skinner box, please. yes yes this is 
what we need - unintuitive software that completely disarms the populace from 
using them! suddenly they're worthless, and can't do anything on any surface. 
it sucks

@ElsaStarTrewyn 
I think you're right. Every letter in the variable name is another byte the OS 
has to keep track of, which was a bigger problem in the past than it is today 
(when it's been made irrelevant)

it's interesting how habits persist though the conditions that caused them have 
faded. like a personal reflection of the environment you learned in.

"A a = new a();" is much more concise and (crucially) you can fit more words to 
the right.

"a + b = c; c -= 2; f_z.write(c); f_z.close();" could conceivably be written on 
a single line if you have short variable names. and when you only have so many 
lines...

glad we're not constrained by those things anymore. the skeletal code that we 
look at daily is much clearer - scope is more important, and so it makes sense 
to encourage a coding style that illustrates it. however I can't help but think 
block formatting like this could be useful in some situations, such as when 
you'd normally be compelled to write a function for an operation that runs once 
or more.
