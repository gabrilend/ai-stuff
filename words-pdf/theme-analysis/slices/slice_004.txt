@hallyesvomet I agree! The problem is the limit as x->0 from the left and right 
trend toward different infinities, meaning it's neither -infinity nor 
+infinity. Which makes me think that it's the value that's exactly in the 
middle, AKA zero.

Why wouldn't 1/0 be zero? Division is just inverse-multiplication, and 
multiplying anything by zero is zero. Why wouldn't division use the same rules?

if you ever need to keep track of the location of your friends in the dark, try 
giving them glowstick bracelets. if you color coordinate them you can tell 
which is which, and as long as you aren't concerned about others noticing you 
then it should be easy to find them all night. works best in places with mixed 
zones of lighting / darkness, like suburbs.

it's impossible to be a blind strategist because of concerns like this. I say 
blind in the general sense, and not just referring to visual impairment - every 
sense provides another tactical angle. more perspectives, more data. sorta like 
taking pictures of a 3d object. when one's sight is lost, you might miss a 
backside or a hidden approach vector that would come easily to others.

at the same time though, a sense of focus can clarify certain truths by paring 
down the amount of irrelevant facets. like optical illusions, sometimes xtra 
info is hidden in the same data...

you're supposed to play the same games as your friends so that you all learn 
the same lessons at the same times. creates for a more cohesive familiar 
structure.

applies also to family movie nights... but it's much more apparent with games 
as you'll often play them for weeks, months, and sometimes even years if you 
keep learning and enjoying them... book clubs are too open to interpretation, 
your pathways don't get a chance to align. games are perfect because they imply 
reaction.

also helps if they're multiplayer, so you can share with another. preferably 
with healthy, respectful competition and a sense of shared brotherhood and 
trust.

the toughest opponents are the ones that aren't aggressive. the ones that let 
you grow uncontested. by taking only neutral resources they guarantee that your 
growth isn't impeded, as after all an equal foe is what you learn best from.

temperature you can adjust your "normal" temperature by wearing fewer clothes 
in the winter and more clothes in the summer - essentially acclimating yourself 
to a slightly more extreme climate. this can be useful if you know you're going 
to travel north / south, and want to be comfortable when you get there. or 
maybe just people who don't want to be vulnerable to air conditioners in the 
winter (whyyyyyy)

taste: you could eat some of these berries and then gnaw on a lemon

sense of compassion: try empathizing with your enemy, just for a moment, even 
if you don't want to, if only to see their trajectory.

(and much longer and healthier) path is true justice, the satisfying feeling

If I ever own a set of weights I'm taping over the numbers and storing them in 
a random order. I don't own a scale because nothing I do is precise enough to 
measure in weight. Except my cat, of course, but I can tell when she's gained 
weight. I cook for myself almost every day, and I never follow a recipe. Each 
dish is different, because I like improvising with ingredients. Like a venture 
to create a desired taste, different components will have different effects 
when cooked in a certain order with certain actions taken to them for a certain 
period of time under certain conditions and ugh it's just too much. I prefer to 
pick a base, pick some vegetables, then pick a seasoning. Cook the base, sautee 
the vegetables, and add the seasoning - bam, delicious meal. I'm not much of a

I wonder if we could make an AI that analyzed workflows in people's jobs and 
abstracted the application of meaningful tasks to a pattern that could be 
matched to other input mechanisms - for example, a mobile game where you push 
buttons and make cool game things happen, but your inputs are defined by the 
mechanics of the game, and those mechanics are essentially just function calls 
that you can hook onto and create additional behavior. Like... running a web 
server that sent your data to a factory where your inputs (based on data 
produced in the factory) could control and manage the various machines and 
productions. Like... heart surgeon robots that can be remotely operated with VR 
or whatever, except instead of medicine you're manufacturing.

essentially, designing a game as an API that can match with the data flows 
(configuring itself on the fly, perhaps?) of a process or activity in some 
other intention.

it you actually put down a deposit. Then, when you're done with it, you get

condition of the thing you're using.

Would work best for things with replaceable parts, because otherwise if you 
like turn in your phone because some irreplaceable part is missing then you 
wouldn't get anything back (except for what the pieces that are replaceable are 
worth)

you still own the thing, it's just that you can trade it in for a down payment 
on the next one you buy. Or for whatever the heck you wanted. Basically the 
system that car's work under, except applied to everything (and maybe run

I revel in that circumstance by posting about whatever I want to talk about. I 
tend to assume that most people do the same, so when I saw your post I assumed 
you wanted to talk about hydration, hence the in-depth nature of my replies _^

okay here's an idea, waterfall project management where the program is 
developed one tiny piece at a time while being streamed to the entire company. 
Everyone would submit answers which could be upvoted / patched / rewritten as 
the main viewer cycles through each aspect of the project, checking for updates 
to it's design that were suggested by developers or whatever. Basically, one 
person (or one team) gets to write the actual source code, while everyone else 
is just offering suggestions. You could break it up by specialty, but the whole 
point is that everyone gets a complete picture of how the program (and 
organization) is structured. Which should give the employees more power to 
generate value for the company. All around a good deal I think? Especially if 
the main viewer took time to explain each and every part so that every viewer 
had the chance to understand.

the reason why order is important is that our actions ripple through eternity. 
we must set a good example for all the baby aliens, don't you think?

EULAs are unenforcable because they're a one-way contract.

"use our service in these ways" is not a fair requirement when you aren't 
getting anything in return. The service has traditionally qualified, but these 
days it's more competitive to promise to be good. Basically, "if we don't 
achieve these metrics (very minutely detailed explanations of the maximum harm 
they could cause to the environment) then you can sue us on our dime. We'll pay 
for your lawyer. If you accept, then you can use our service, BUT ONLY if you 
don't pirate it or whatever. And we'll promise to be good, and if you don't 
think that's good enough... Okay let us know and we'll consider including it."

A reasonable base target for "maximum harm to the environment" is net zero. 
Even better is total zero. But that's often impossible, and besides nature can 
heal a little scratch or two. But like... pumping toxic chemicals into 
waterways, polluting the air and clouds, bulldozing precious habitats... yeah 
that's too much. we must live in tandem.

disney movies taught me that sometimes, if you're kind and good enough, the 
villain will change their mind.

It's difficult to change your perspective. Like believing a different way about 
something. But just because it's difficult to do, doesn't mean it's impossible 
- in fact it's quite plausible, we have examples scattered throughout time.

you can get better at it, with practice. it's one of the neat things about 
being human - that our choices have meaning. an animal animaling is just 
expressing it's form - but a cat or a dog, who've lived with humans their whole 
life, start to have visions of ethics.

your cat knows when she's being a shit. she know's it's wrong, but she knows 
it's how you most love her. that is an ethical decision, and it came through 
her proximity to humans.

the ability to guide our own fate is determined not by our choices in our 
moments, but rather by the structure of the mind we define. our choices are 
patterns that are reflected through repetition, but values and morals are our 
own

@larsfrommars@toot.garden 

children care more about boundaries and harming others because they are more 
vulnerable, and their existence is predicated on the goodwill of others. It's a 
scary position to be in, one that abused children are all too familiar with and 
are probably rolling their eyes at the obviousness of it all.

To an adult, a child seems fragile. Like, such a small and precious thing, I 
would die for it. I don't care who they become or who they've been, if I see a 
child in danger I would die for it. Though I'd probably do the same for anyone 
I guess.

Seems like it'd be helpful to build into the ActivityPub standard a setting 
that an account can decide for itself whether it interacts with 

then before it shows you any posts just check the filter and idk I feel like

usually someone will correct you and say "oh it's because X Y and Z" and you 
say "cool" and change your direction

but sometimes their answers "unlock" part of your past understandings, thus 
creating new questions.

Sorta like in a video game when you level up a certain building/research path/
