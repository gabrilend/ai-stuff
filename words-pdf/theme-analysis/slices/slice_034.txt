@raeve 

stand up, put your hands on your knees. It's about that high. Think about your 
bedroom, or if you're already there think about your kitchen. If you were 
standing in your kitchen and the grass was growing there, it'd peek just over 
the bed, or maybe climb just this far up the cabinets.

it's dark green. Can you see anything dark green around you? It's that color. 
If not, can you remember a dark-green thing? What did it look like?

The very tops, the part by your hand that's on your knee, that's the purple 
part. Just at the tip of the blade, the part that would stab you if the grass 
was a sword, that's the purple bit. Everything else is dark green.

I wonder how it sways in the wind? Does it bend, and whip? What if there's a 
gale? Does it sway back and forth, or is it stiff and shiver like dead leaves 
on a tree?

imagination comes from questions, and the subsequent development of instinctual 
subconscious questions like this. What lies in the gaps? what if we colored 
outside the lines? what more to see?

I am not interested in being given money. Usually it means someone wants

why would I need more money? I like my stuff! I'll help out when people need 
help but I do that because I'm a good person, not because I want you to fucking 
pay me for it.

I have all the things I need... except a deed to my house. apartment. oh yeah, 
they can kick you out for that sin. well, sorry, I couldn't find out at 
goodwill or in the trash bin, so I guess I'm deed-less. My deeds go unproven. 
How can I prove that I deserve a decent life in this particular roof, the one I 
find over my head, when I cannot prove that my deeds qualify me for a decent 
life lived under this particular roof?

I mean, did you ask the neighbors if they want me gone? Am I really that

Does my cat meow and bother the children? Do my friendly smiles and waves make 
you uncomfortable?

One of the first video games I ever played was Dragon Warrior 3 for the gameboy 
color.

The game starts with god asking you about yourself in a dream. This was the 
first time I heard the word "gemini" - At one point, she asks if you are M or F.

Me, being a child, thought she was asking if I wanted to go "medium speed" or 
"fast speed" and I'm like, hell yeah I wanna go fast

that's it

that's the whole reason I'm trans

at one point in the game I became a queen of a faraway land

and I couldn't leave the castle without the guards saying "no no miss you can't 
leave, it's too dangerous for a battle-hardened adventurer dainty flower like 
you to leave"

(I think they say you have to renounce your claim to the throne if you want to 
leave but I would rather fucking die)

so I never got farther than that. Sorry world, but I didn't end up slaying the 
demon king, I sorta just walked around the palace and cried because it felt 
like the game was over.

I think it'd be cool if strategy games had slightly randomized rules each time 
you played them

everything from +/- 5% hp to this particular unit to every airplane factory has 
10% production speed but builds 10 units at once

and at the start of the game each player is given 1 minute to go over the 
"patch notes" and build out a strategy

both of which they can reference throughout the game. Why don't games come with 
a built-in scratch-notepad that syncs to a file on your directory of choice? 
Maybe a small little paint program dropping pngs?

9 times out of 10 the answer is fuck yes, you're my friend, I support 
everything you're handling. Give me the word and I'll be there, ride or die, 
I'm here for it.

something I wrote a while back:

fucking boss your friends around

it's as easy as saying "hey I'm gonna go do this-or-that thing, you don't seem 
busy can you do that-or-this thing for me? I need it done by this-and-this time 
- oh you're busy? yeah no worries I'll go ask someone else. oh you're busy 
resting? doing girl healing? hell yeah next time invite me I'm due for a "pizza 
and weed" night."

don't take on more than you can handle. if your plate is full, don't check out 
the notes by the roadside. Doing so tells all the nearby drivers "hey I need a

route to your house.

get the heartiest vegetable soup you can find from the store and cook some 
jasmine rice and lentils in a pot. You should be able to do both in the same 
pot. cook them like noodles by boiling some water and adding the rice and 
beans. add some salt to the water. make it salty like the sea.

then drain the rice and beans once you taste test them to be done. be patient. 
add the hearty, savory soup to the mix alongside a big hunk of butter.

boom, protein, calories, nutrients. all in one meal. the more vegetables in the 
soup, the better, and if you're feeling fancy you can sautee some of your own 
instead of soup by dicing them into inch large chunks and throwing them in a 
pan on medium heat with some butter and whatever seasonings you want for a

you can just, make a company, and it can work toward whatever goals you want. 
It doesn't have to be profit - and in fact most companies don't seek profit at 
first. They seek to fulfill the vision of their visionaries.

it's only once the company is bought by opportunist investors does it start to 
go downhill. Remember when google changed their motto to not be "don't be 
evil"? that's an example. The company was sold, or maybe was corrupted by rapid 
success, and so it started to seek power.

I personally feel like if a part of a building is primarily structural, it 
should be legal and allowed to graffiti it as much as you want. Including by 
painting over it with a single color, to give a blank canvas.

if a part of a building is intended to be artistic rather than structural, 
perhaps it shouldn't be allowed. But still legal.

with a special exception for bathroom stalls, which are fun to draw on and 
should have a sharpie-on-a-string within easy reach

if you graffiti an artistic piece, then it changes the message without the 
consent of the structure/sculpture's creator. I personally believe that is 
wrong, and therefore we should be respectful for all pieces of art.

in addition, I believe that art cannot be permanently sold - it should always 
be leased, with a variable payment plan frequency, price, and duration.

what if we conceptualized "nazis" as dead nazi spirits who used evil occult 
magic to return and haunt the minds of poor impressionable kids and turn them 
into school shooters or whatever.

and then their propaganda wing came back and they started doing youtube channels

now they're infecting heads of state and slowly corrupting the nation

evil, dark things, with only hatred and malice in their heart of hearts

I'm not talking about your probably-mostly-fine-but-still-pretty-bad 
grandfather who definitely shot over the heads of the allies, but rather the 
truly evil and twisted of sorts.

the kind that lived in America, and lynched people who were sleeping in their 
beds. For... nothing... for nothing at all. They wanted to see them writhe on 
the rope. To shudder in pain and scream of terror most profane.

Then they teamed up in the afterlife and decided to conquer the world. Start 
with America.

put the variable type at the front of the variable and 90% of your type errors 
will dissapear

like...int int_main(){ return 0; }


orint int_modulation_gauge_percentage_point_plus_or_minus_engagement = 0;


seeeee if the "int" value is at the start of the name then you can do this 
too:double double_modulation_gauge_percentage_point_plus_or_minus_engagement = 
0.0;


then when you go to fill in an "int" value you know to use the one that has the 
"int" value at the beginning (doh)

(do you really think they haven't tried that already? it... sorta worked. 
people started doing things like "int int_a; int int_b; int int_c;" and such 
and that got confusing pretty quick because the letters weren't at the start of 
the word. So for some situations we would mirror them like so: "int A = int_a; 
int B = int_b; int C = int_c;" and then just use the capitalized letters.

shadowed variables)
