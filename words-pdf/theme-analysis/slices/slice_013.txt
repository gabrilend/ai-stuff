Alright ya'll, if they're going to automate our jobs out of existence then 
perhaps its time we started doing the same to them. I mean, they're working on 
automating not just creative jobs, but also most office jobs as well. Leaving 
only menial labor to us, which is "fine" I guess.

But perhaps we can "strike back" as it were and dismantle capitalism at the 
same time.

Does that sound like too much to hope for? I think not! It's simple really, we 
just need to design a generic and compelling alternative to buying stuff with a 
credit card. Okay, it's a bit less simple than that, and I never said it would 
be easy. In fact, getting people to agree is the hard part. So can't we all 
just agree to attempt different things in different places as the locals 
define? Seems natural to me.

And now the part of the post where I point a finger at you, yes you, the person 
reading this post. Are you willing to think about alternatives to capitalism? 
Are you willing to utilize the tools of our masters to break the chains of 
those enslaved? Are you willing to put effort into facilitating the development 
of crucial systems which may one day govern our day-to-day?

If yes, then perhaps you'd like to listen as I explain how I envision the near 
future may look, as we plod onward day-by-day toward our bright fully automated 
luxury gay space communist future, where nobody has to hunger and nobody has to 
hurt. Not unless they consent, of course.

Ah, shit, I should probably have prepared a presentation or something. Gimme a 
sec.

I wear diapers. I fucking hate diapers.

I go in cycles with it. Waves, if you will. Sometimes I'll say "screw this I'm 
sick of them for one of many reasons I'm going to put in the effort and do all 
the kegels and just fucking handle it" and like, that sorta works. At least, 
most of the time.

The thing about diapers is that while yes, you only need to think about your 
bodily functions like, twice a day, when you do it's more acute. It takes like 
10 minutes to change, it generates trash that you have to throw away, it's 
literally pissing on cash made out of plastic fossil fuels, it smells, it's 
loud (fuck the noise) and its a pain in the ass when you get diaper rash. Ugh I 
hate it.

So, sometimes I say "fuck it" and I go without. And it works most of the time. 
But eventually after getting piss on the carpet one too many times, after 
throwing away your favorite underwear AGAIN, after trying your best to face 
away from people so they don't see the wet spot on your butt... Eventually you 
think "hey maybe diapers aren't that bad" and the cycle repeats.

And look, I know I'm traumatized. I've been dealing with my own shit since I 
was a kid. But, like, therapy won't help me get to the toilet. A doctor's not 
going to be able to fix my brain deciding "hey I want to piss myself right now 
for no fucking reason at all", and yeah my muscles aren't great so sure I can 
exercise them or whatever.

But there have been times in my life when I've had a pelvic floor as strong as 
steel, and it didn't fucking help. Because my brain is stupid.

I can feel it happening (most of the time, sometimes it surprises me like "oh 
weird I can't remember peeing my pants") and I usually have at least enough 
notice to clamp down (if I'm quick) but, like, I am constantly stressed out 
about it. I'm constantly on guard, waiting for it to happen. It's fucking 
exhausting.

God forbid I have a public accident. Those are the fucking worst. And though I 
try my hardest, a year doesn't go by when I don't have at least one. If I'm 
diapered (as I fucking should be, tbh) then I can handle it. If not, then I'm 
fucked and I'm mentally a wreck for the rest of the day. Sorry @ everyone who's 
smelled me throughout my whole life.

I don't think it's a physical issue, I was (briefly) checked out as a kid and 
they didn't find anything wrong. I think they thought I was faking because I 
couldn't manage to pee in a cup. Whatever.

And I've read basically everything on the Internet about this. Apparently 40% 
of cases (across all age groups) are idiopathic, meaning there's no known 
cause. I wonder what percentage is because people are like, into it sexually?

I admit I look at that kind of porn. It makes me feel corroded inside. I think 
I do it to relive my trauma in some fucked up way, like "oh wouldn't it be nice 
if a witch cursed me and now I pee my pants" instead of the harsher reality 
where its like "no you're just like this" which, sucks, not gonna lie.

It's kinda made me asexual, I think, because I don't want anyone to be around 
it. I don't want anyone to think about it, I don't want it to be real, it's 
just. Fucked. I guess. Whatever.

Did I mention how much I hate how loud it is to change? It fills me with dread 
whenever that time comes around. I often put it off as long as I can because I 
just... Don't want to think about it. And then it overflows and leaks and its 
even worse because now I have to wash my pants. Or, like, not, and just let 
them dry, because I'm a disgusting human being who has no right to a clean and 
decent life. Fuck me I should live in a bog, with all the bugs and the toads 
and other various gross things.

When they invade America, it won't be with planes and tanks and battle lines 
stocked with artillery 

It'll be with speed boats, and semi trucks, and rifles glimmering in the dark. 
It'll be with consumer drones, with power stations brought low, it'll be with 
bridges blown and safe houses on the roads not oft taken.

Immigrants are our friends when the world is in peril, and America is a safe 
haven from the woes of far off shores. But when America is the peril, those who 
immigrate do so with intention.

99/100 people are innocent, and I would rather a million guilty murderers go 
free than an innocent perish. Which is why we need rifles.

When the time comes, it won't be brother against brother. They want you to 
think that because they want your eyes on the wrong target. They want you to 
think that because it doesn't tip the hand of those far off shores, and once 
the cards are revealed, suddenly everyone knows when to go.

They tie up our officers at the border, but the border's not what's at stake. 
No body lives at the border, and no nation state would send it's trained 
warriors in such a way that they'd get caught. At least, not more than once.

Should we build a wall, should we patrol each and every state, we'll find 
ourselves in peril of collapsing under our own weight.

But should we relinquish our duty, our sworn and sacred responsibility, then 
together we share the same fate.

Brothers in fate are kin until death.

Immigrants aren't bad. They're good people. They benefit our society and bring 
us wealth and prosperity. Which is why they hide wolves in the sheep, armed 
like a man.

It's a mistake to point at your neighbor and say "you're on your own". It's a 
mistake to say that home is all that you own. We are united in our state of 
solidarity, in our collective purpose as a nation in our hearts. There's no 
dividing line between this land and mine, save for a line we draw in the sand 
that determines the range of our just demands.

I wish I was a man. It's what I was born as. It surely would be easier to not 
contravene nature's ordained gender scheme. But I'm not, and I'll trust that 
you'll trust me when I say that. I hope you would hear where I stand before my 
body goes cold.

The media is meant to enlighten us, but in this enlightened era it serves only 
to blind us. Do you know your neighbors, oh unfriendly city folk? If not, how 
do you know they're alright?

The world won't change overnight. It's always calm before the storm, but every 
state of calm does not call forth a storm. I believe we can fashion a peace out 
of our mutual sincerity that leaves room for the hopes of all posterity, and to 
that end I say what we have isn't working. It's too rigid in its definitions, 
too heartless in its cruel machinations, and yet the wolves do also hide 
amongst our homeless.

I don't want to alarm you. Things are being handled as they should. I guess I 
just want to offer a hand of friendship, a hand that your companions would stab 
me for. At least, that's what the media tells me.

Conservatives don't have to be pro communism to be good people. They just have 
to be anti fascist.

And unfortunately, capitalism has produced fascism. It will continue to do so 
if left unabated.

Capitalism is not the middle ground between administrative authority and 
anarchic despotism as they claim to see it, but rather a whirlpool that drains 
through our adversity. A sinking tide strands all ships, as it were, and 
together we will begin to falter.

Fascists are quite good at bending the will of whatever system they inhabit to 
suit their needs. In fact it is almost a certainty that any sufficiently 
organized institution shall fall prey to it, as if it were part of our nature.

Hence, my desire to abstract it out of our hands, and into the care of the 
future. We can build a better world for you and for me and all of our 
posterity, it's just a matter of interdependent communication protocols.

Nobody has to do what I say, nobody should be forced to be a certain way, and 
just as your rights end where another's begin so too is our world in danger.

For you see, we have a right to litter. To despoil. To leave the earth in 
turmoil. And though I am a bit bitter, it's slowly getting better, so through 
our efforts we are investitured.

Humans were not designed for repetitive labor. You can see this manifest in the 
way our muscles regrow after being stressed, strained, and trained. If you do 
500 pushups, your pushup muscles will be pretty exhausted and unusable for the 
next day or two. However your abs will probably be fine, your legs too. This 
shows that humans are meant to exercise different muscle groups on different 
days, like one day catching fish, the next plucking fruit, the next chopping 
wood, the next running with wolves.

Humans are not designed to do the same thing every day. It hurts not just our 
bodies, but our minds as well. Repetitive thought patterns such as "welcome to 
[store] can I take your order" dig grooves in our brain that are difficult to 
unlearn. And the abstraction of a man to a machine in the hands of capital is 
profane and strange to the watchers within. But hey, gotta do what ya gotta do, 
rents gotta get paid, and nobody wants to scrub toilets. But it's gotta get 
done if you want hospitals and supercomputers.

Okay how about this, for starters? Jobs can no longer ask for degrees, instead 
they must rely on certifications. In addition, everyone who has completed a 
degree receives money every month in exchange for their increased value they 
bring to whichever job hires them. This money is sourced from a tax taken on 
businesses in rough proportion to the amount of money they save by paying their 
employees the same amount, no matter their education.

I want to work with compute shaders. massively distributed computations that

sacrificing the incredibly expensive modern gaming graphical requirements.

make the entire map covered in a 3d grid of spheres. These spheres register
collision, and keep track of a endlessly tabulating record of every object that
has passed through them. Like the replay system in Blizzard games, where each
time through the recording it recreates the playthrough exactly. Which is why
.mp4 recordings always look so... stilted. It lacks the human element. BUT if
they're remade every time the show is performed, perhaps from different
perspectives, then, well, the players can perform as they need to be.

Have you ever wished your players could get better at your game? I certainly
have, because the better you get the more lessons you learn as a player, which
is essentially the only way to maintain satisfaction. Satisfied players don't
leave, and satisfaction comes most readily when there is something new to be
had. Meaning the greater the change in a player's ranking, the better they're
getting.

Downside is, players who are naturally good from their skills in other games
tend to not learn so much! Ah, well, if only there was a way to tailor the
difficulty setting to each and every new host. Such an innovation would surely
enable the entire playerbase to exist on the same level. Then just throw AI
assisted voice transcription at their recorded voices and everytime they
say "I'm bronze rating" or "I'm diamond" then you can switch it around to say
like "I'm platinum" or "I'm grandmaster" and BAM suddenly everyone is at the
same level. No more concerns about a game's population being diverse. Because
at the end of the day, when most people have moved on, the ones who are left
are your most dedicated customers. Customers who aren't especially interested
in the new stuff.

being disabled is a disability, and we should attempt to ameliorate the added
difficulties from said disability. Like, ramps for wheelchairs, ADA, or more
controversially, financial aid. Because buying things is how we contribute to
the economy, and increasingly the economy *is* our society. It's unfair for
those who cannot work or cannot live with others (because they smell like they
pissed themselves 24/7) should not be forced to live in a worse world just
because we believe everyone should be equal. Some people are not equal. Some
people piss themselves, and the fact that they can't have roommates means they
have to spend more money on housing than others. That's an inequity that doesn't
have to exist. In fact it is easily solvable using our currently active systems,
namely... dollars are able to be given.

what is the purpose of a man to a society? What do we mean to do here on this
earth? how best could our structures and our cultures be utilized to align
ourselves toward our most desired of purpose? And what is that purpose, do you
think (for each man)? y'know I bet that's something we could ascertain now that
we have an AI that can talk to every single person ever and build up a database

                                     then right ---> V W X Y Z

so, like, tap tap tap (pause) tap tap would equal M
          tap tap     (pause) tap tap would equal G

like morse code, but easier since you don't have to memorize anything

(also note that K is missing becuase it's an extra character I guess)

(I personally would have eliminated C but that's just me)

Capitalism isn't perfect but if it's capitalism or cyberpunk North Korean style 
dystopia, I'll pick capitalism. Can we at least make it so that the rich aren't 
safe financially though? Like, if you own a billion dollars it should be 
because you make a billion dollars per year. Anything you don't spend should be 
taxed away, to be used for public services and the defence of our nation.

Listen, there comes a certain point when you realize that most people will just 
go along with whatever gets them whatever they want. And for most people, 
that's fast food and TV. Like... You know that George Carlin quote about the 
average person and how stupid they are? Yeah. It's not a fucking joke. Most 
people are dumb as rocks. But they still deserve to live, and they still 
control our democracy through their majority, so... The system works ? ? ? I 
guess ? ? ?

... Anyway at this point, when you realize the things that people in this 
thread are saying, that's the point when you should start finding your peers. 
Find people who "get it" and start working to upend it. People who don't "get 
it" will "get it" when it materially impacts their lives, and unfortunately for 
all of us (including them) that point will never arrive. For you see the 
system's aligned such that people like them are attended to with utmost care, 
and people like us are left to rot. Well, it's our job to fix it, so... riot.

"fool's luck", the kind that runs out and betrays you, is fundamentally an 
unethical action. Borrowing from the future to sate the demands of the present 
is no different than burning fossil fuels, wasting our children's future on our 
need for convenience in a world we are oppressed and compelled to do nothing 
else. Capitalism, or by extension any authoritarian society (yes, capitalism is 
authoritarian, as power compels via authority and the weight of currency that 
is thrown around by those chosen to suit their ends and used to deny us our 
needed goods) ... as I was saying capitalism compels us to consume because 
we're all just so tired at the end of the day, it just makes sense to drive a 
car to work instead of biking. Or buying fast food instead of local grown 
goods. Why can't each state have it's own "food preparation plant" that 
prepares things exactly as you would for the processed foods we currently eat? 
Heck, if the jobs for it were local, it's likely that people would begin to 
realize just how unhealthy they are for you. Local, and open source, meaning 
run by society and just as open source codebases will accept pull requests and 
merge their branches into main, so too would our votes decide which processes 
are updated and which parameters are tweaked. Something you can vote for once, 
and then your vote stays until it's passed (or you change your mind). ... Works 
for all kinds of inter-mechano-people-communi-coordination. (organizations, 
institutions, and societies in one word, jeez how arcane)

... anyway that's basically how algorism works, except instead of EVERYONE 
voting on EVERYTHING, people would vote for representatives who would vote for 
them. And there's like, 4-6 layers (I forget the exact number) because people 
are organized (by location) into groups of 70, and each general location has 
the option to switch into a different commune, as long as they're generally 
localized to the same area. Like, the tier above has a certain amount of space, 
and the tier above has just a bit more, and more, etc... Well, anyway, people 
could join higher level communes with more and different people if they wanted. 
It's just, they'd be far away and wouldn't be able to hang out with them, so 
it's use would be a little "disconnected". Like, absentee voters who are 
actually living in a different country or something - did you know you can 
usually vote at your embassy? Wild. They also send out packets you can fill in 
which correspond to the votes you'd like to make - pretty neat! It's wild how 
we, in the 21st century, have all kinds of valuable social technologies like 
"mail in ballots" that people in the communist past had no way of conceiving. 
Kinda makes me think we should re-approach the design for our socialized 
infrastructure, something taking the modern social and political capabilities 
in mind. Sure would be nice if we could focus on our future, the kind that the 
children of ours sure would like to approach.

(speaking as a trans person who won't have children of my own, whether by my 
body's nature or through the fate of circumstance that leaves me no time to 
cope.)

the future is a scary place. But so too is every place in time. Turns out, the 
level of fear and anxiety and all that sorta stays the same. It's just a 
quality of life on our host, that certain variables were optimized for in the 
genetic coding of our human's possible bio-mechanical communicicative 
[interactions/patterns]

... anyway, these are the questions about the present I like to ask, questions 
that can give meaning forth to our [then, future tense] future. Answers can be 
found by looking the other way - learning what our [then, past tense], selves 
had marked down as the answer. The trick is matching the current situation onto 
a comparitively similar experience in the [then, past tense] that we understood 
to be the answer to our situation back [then, past tense]. And [they, future 
tense] can look upon our choices and our decisions and our meaningfully applied 
mechanico-interactions (actions), and from it bring forth new meanings that 
[we, present tense] have available to address and understand for [us, all 
tenses]. Call it a form of ancestor worship, applied to the future and to 
ourselves. A unified dedication to the spirit of our [condemnation, positive 
tense], our collective geas we all share, our faith in the truth of humanity. 
Bio-essential truth, if you will. "Humanity" is the label that is applied to us 
by our genes, and since we share that fact there is nothing that strange about 
being human. Our natures are as they are, derived from our history in 
evolution. What features would we like humanity to 
[behold/become/be-able-to-implement-to-our-own-satisfaction]?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LLMs search for patterns, not for truth. They meaningfully represent large sums 
of data in a way that is learned through repetitive training - given examples, 
then given those examples a thousand times more, to compare to the truth that 
is derived from them. At least, that's the claim, but somewhere along the line 
the logic is twisted - the truth is, you don't have to be trained a thousand 
times. You just have to be given the notion that a particular understanding was 
more or less important. Like, instead of having ten billion examples of what a 
picture of a cat looks like, perhaps you simply need to be able to show it 
yourself. There's no need for large stores of information when you can just, 
learn from the moment and through your own tested hypothesis-calculations. It's 
always been somewhat of a processor intensive activity, but hardly the kinds of 
demands that your fake AGIosity [contends, but demands again]. So, like, attach 
a multiplier instead of an addition sign. "this particular thing, but x1.5" 
according to the number of (and intensity of) the events at hand.

for example, people don't often know they're in danger (on a meta-level) which 
is why so many of the jews were lost to hitler. We learn things slowly, but 
collectively, then we apply our collected strength toward solving it. Frankly, 
wars are a great time to show our capabilities under pressure - capitalism 
keeps us that way at all times, rather than giving us moments to prove our 
worth. Frankly, I know which I'd prefer, but if you think about it war simply 
measures our capacity to learn. Acceleration, not speed. And without 
investments in long-term-duration, we lose progress as we've lost many of our 
greatest examples!

Think about it. If you gathered every single nerd into a place the size of 
state of rhode island and then dropped a nuke on them, society as a whole would 
be seriously set back. All that wasted application of knowledge! Ah, well, but 
upon re-learning, we might not even learn anything new at all. Knowledge is 
nice, which is brought through periods of peace, but so too is it useful to be 
exercised toward our ambitions. Both are moments that help us grow collectively 
as a species, to deliver us from sticks and mud to marble statues to concrete 
and tire dust to marble statues, as we build this place into a garden of our 
earth. Yggdrasil, the world tree, the land of eden.

people would take pilgrimages to our world, while we figured out how to live on 
Mars, then Venus, then wherever else our dreams did take us.

take your bash script and update it to possess new functionality, like the 
ability to re-order your posts and display them on a viewer - or the ability to 
draw connections between them, showing them in context with one another. Then, 
use that as display to the user, through the LLM interface. (do it locally, 
it's only for long-term explanations.) (the user needs to be able to ask 
questions to the machine, and the machine needs up-to-date information. So give 
it the ability to make "compound phrases" like "the water temperature is at " 
or " degrees. This is a [good/bad] thing because " and such, and then string 
them together using typical ranges of past numerical datas as reference. Like, 
if something is normally between 100 and 5000 then suddenly it's at 14 or some 
other threshold (make sure nothing goes below 0, measuring inertia and impact 
density and other factors) - but identify the connections between each factor, 
so that you understand which ones are correlating to which effects on the 
others. Measure things in terms of proximity, and suddenly 3d graphs become a 
lot easier.

the more human a creation becomes, the easier it is to teach it. Interesting 
how that works. Might there be any advantage to our continual and dedicated 
efforts toward learning? We are always improving, we're always at our own pace,

drawer, whenever it's opened you're rattled around and your edge goes dull. But

and gives you the chance to learn. So don't forget us in your journey to

"updating software" is when you go back and add helper functions for things you 
used had to do to solve a problem but didn't get a chance to make. Because you 
were making more important things and couldn't pad out all the possibilities. 
But if you want great software, then you both take more time to accomplish that 
and you give yourself time for it after it's been launched. Basically, 
companies are incentivized to only support their products if it makes them 
money. Meaning reputations are tarnished, and profit is affected. Capitalists 
intentionally drive businesses into the ground, forcing them to make terrible 
decisions in order to destroy them. It's a warfare against those on the 
[bottom/floor/ground-floor].

Some businesses strive for long-term potential, and some will create 
infrastructure that can be sold to another. Essentially, keeping the dream of 
learning alive, through applying yourself to both long-term and short-term 
conclusions. Not everything has to be for some grand design, we're here to

I had a dream last night about a battleship in WWII. In my dream, a meteor fell 
from the sky and punched a hole right through several parts of this ship, 
leaving the rest essentially unscathed. Primarily? The command deck, 
navigations, and communications. The people aboard the ship were given a 
crucial moment to decide what to do with their lives, and the guy who said 
"let's go fight the jerries" was promptly thrown overboard.

It was mostly a first-person dream, from the perspective of a mind-reading 
kraken watching from below. Though I often felt like a sailor, so perhaps a 
shape shifting mind reading kraken watching from wherever was most convenient.

The ship floated by for some time, not knowing where it was going nor where it 
intended to be, until one day it came across another floundering in the dark. 
This ship was drowning, or so it seemed to the tentacles below, and our first 
ship dutifully did it's part and saved what it could. The people of that ship 
were significantly more battlehardened, having lost their war against their 
foe, and so they attempted to gain control of the ship upon getting settled. 
They were promptly thrown overboard. More snacks for me...

Then, the ship came to port. A great port of concrete and metal, it inched up 
the rock face and hugged tight to the land. Then the dream did veer as dreams 
often do, and I've forgotten most of what my point of view cared for and worked 
toward. But then I stood too close to a nuclear engine or something and got 
sick and died. It was weird, idk what's up with that. 

Anyway dreams are like that I guess, keep dreaming until you either die or are 
kicked out by your host who doesn't agree with your actions to such a degree 
that they're irreconcilable with their own intentions.

Pretty sure I'm just legitimately a bad person. Basically everything I've ever 
tried to do has failed, and every opportunity I've mishandled or squandered in 
some way. I have no friends because I am incapable of being good, and though I 
believe in goodness I fail to manifest it in my life. I am kind, I am polite, I 
am friendly, I am honest, but none of those things really matter because I 
can't take care of myself, which means I can't take care of anyone else, and I 
can't fight because I'm a coward.

Okay, I'm not a coward, I just can't be brave if I don't have a plan for 
defeating my foe. At the BLM riots I fled as soon as they brought out the tear 
gas. I knew what happened at Tiannamen and I was pretty sure that something 
similar was going to happen to us. I knew it to be true. I am a coward, but 
only because I ran when I had no plan. I could not contest tear gas, and all 
that tear gas implies, because I had no friends. I didn't have a community I 
could fight to defend. I had no weapons, no training, no orders, no guidance, 
nothing but my bravery. And bravery alone is fucking stupid, and I'm not stupid.

Each and every decision I've made has created a worse world for me and my 
people. What's wrong with me? Why can't I do everything right? Am I cursed to 
be the worst? I try as hard as I can to be as good as I can as often as I 
can... Basically, always and forever, and yet... And yet...

I've wasted all the resources that have been applied to me. I've wasted and 
squandered all these years when I could be building a better future. I have 
been in university for almost a decade, and all I've accomplished is 
friendship. Great. Parties, drugs, video games... But no studying. Studying is 
too hard on me. I'm more of a natural talent kind of person, and yet I insist 
on applying myself to tasks that seem to require trained intelligence. They say 
that genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration, and I refuse to perspire.

And yet when the time comes, when someone sits me down and says "let's work on 
this together" I would die before the task is finished. Unless my partner needs 
a break, or if I need a break, breaks are okay. But I will complete that task 
with them by my side. I won't do it for them, but I'll help them because I'm a 
helper. An assistant. I don't do, I advise. I judge. I determine. I assess, and 
I plan, and I strategize. But I'm not that great at any of those things because 
nobody will hire me for those kinds of things, meaning I don't get experience 
for those kinds of things, which means I am eternally a novice at the only 
things I'm good at.

I can't fucking do it anymore. I'm such a bad person and I can't be alive this 
way. It's not right, it's not fair, and I'm dying bit-by-bit each and every day.

one of the potential ways to contribute as a citizen in a country at war is to
keep and maintain stuff.

Put yourself somewhere that you believe your stuff is most safe, and then work
on developing the technologies of the land. Like, this house has a drone, this
one has a garden - this house has a printer, and this one has a backyard that
kinda looks like a courtroom. Oh hey here's a public fountain, and gee someone
needs to take care of this bank - all that we can really live for, now that our
fate is taken from our hands and placed in the hands of those who fight for us.

witches are an interesting thing to be. they're curious and ambitious but tend
to do things ethically. I know in my heart of hearts that it is better to be
kind, to work to help others achieve what they want while guiding them toward
a more ethical future using the tools you have available to you. It feels better
to be adored than hated, and not only sensually but meta-strategically as well.
Frankly, it's easiest to be harmed when caught unawares. Everyone needs to be
conscious and careful and attendent to the present in order for understandings
to be made. We all benefit from one another, society is a non-zero-sum game. If
we contribute, we may build a bigger and brighter future (like grains of sand
forming a pyramid)

The good guy always wins the story because otherwise we'd be vulnerable. Stories
are a collective way of examining their tribal society for weaknesses. It's
something we picked up in the grand society of the tribes, before nations and
before and after agriculture. But post communication. Pre it was just like, "hey
this is my tree, that one's yours" but the more we talked to one another and the
more we engaged with one another the more we learned. Most animals learn less
than humans because our expressions (both physical and motion-al) are so much
more diverse. The more complex you get, the more you can learn. Which isn't
so much something we evolved into, but rather something we learned. From wearing
clothes, mostly, because like... it's cold in this ice age. Some people wore one
kind of animal, another had another. And the really rich, the ones who could
gather multiple hides, well they had more animals to hunt, less competition for
some reason, or whatever. Anyway they wore different types of hides, and frankly
it was kinda intense. It's still intense to be hunted, but if humans stopped
then the animals would control the earth.

I believe it is our duty and our destiny to remove ourselves from the biological
equation. I think we should find a way to live on our own, so that animals are
not harmed. So that plants can grow in peace and compete according to their
values rather than their flavors. There's too much homogenaeity in our world,
too much planted of the same crop. Let life subside, and nature will take hold.

information and acted in a dishonorable way unknowingly, then they should not be
at fault. And if they are pushed to 

side note, but you should be introduced to the 70 closest people you live to
whenever you move into a new house. Just so you know who's who. Plus maybe you
could get a new friend. And you'd quickly learn which houses were empty.

At least, the ones near you.

Kinda makes me think we should have a map of that kind of thing, like "oh yeah
so-and-so takes care of these 5 houses doing daily maintenance and repair" and
"this house with these capabilities should be attended to by this person who's
skilled in their upkeep and usage" and then maybe we could track statistics
about "this house was used for these productive activities this many times" and
we could determine when we needed more or less of a certain type of product/
project/protect. [but also like, capabilities for our betterment]

and like, every area would be connected to a group chat and like, if you said
something that wasn't relevant to the people on one side of town versus things
that weren't relevant to people on the other side, then they wouldn't be bother-
-ed. It's great because you can always go up a tier of abstraction and see the
conversation higher up. It'd be a lot of data to sort through so you'd probably
use your custom-trained AI that's learned from nothing but every single one of
your actions. And only it sees them, so it can't like spy on you or whatever.
Basically your "computer" self.

... yeah anyway with lots of messaging data (like "oh how are we going to find
this particular chemical in order to fulfill this particular demand in our area"
or "we currently have 15 maids in the area in order to fulfil the requirements
of the 20 dirtiest houses in this area, and people have reported that the area
is growing untidy, so we should ask around (at a higher level of national
abstraction) and find some more maids to help out." that kind of thing

doesn't have to be just for work too, people can have social messaging and
social media too. So long as it's projectable at whatever level of abstraction
you'd like. Maybe for social posts in order to keep things relatively chill you
could only post like, idk 12 posts each year at the state level, or maybe 2 at
regional and 0.25 at national. If you wanted more you'd have to sacrifice
something else, and like... yeah sure whatever, the point is that you'd make
more personal, close thoughts, and occasionally you'd have the opportunity to
show your heart and make friends. Then, people would "add you as a friend" or 
"put you on their follow list" or "subscribe to their subreddit" or whatever the
heck, meaning they could see you at an assignable level of abstraction.

I'm picturing a discrete things, something you can scroll with on a mouse.
Except, you'd scroll up for a closer perspective and scroll down to get a wider
reach of Social.

... Anyway that would use the same system as the "workplace attention
distribution system - with auto-determining heuristics". Wow they've been busy.

that's the neat thing about engineers, give them a task and they'll build the
shit out of it. They'll spare no expense, truly fulfilling the exact demands of
the design. So they work best when you let them run wild and rampant.

why the fuck do we need billion dollar contracts with defence companies? Just
get a bunch of physicists and engineers in a room and they'll make you a doom
laser in like, 20 minutes.

it's up to us, as people, to determine whether or not they should go through
with the designs they come up with. As long as we understand that weakness is
defined as something that can destroy us. An army determines where we are most
weak, and where we excel. A proficient army would identify their most likely
doctrine to succeed and apply it to it's utmost and most excellent.

For example, the US focuses on air-power because not only do we have a lot of
space to develop these things, we also are positioned in such a position that we
control both halves of a continent. This is essentially unprecedented in the
history of the world, which is why we've been able to grow so decadent.

... anyway, milk and honey are fine in times of peace. We kinda stole the land
though, so it's kind of a shit system. Like, if Europeans wanted to control the
world then why didn't they start with everything surrounding the medditeranean?

... oh wait they kinda did. That's what Europa Universalis is about, the ways
the European powers did the cruel and horrible things they did. We can learn how
systems like intercontinental trade became available and how it led to vast and
terrible social upheavals. Colonization is not okay, it's not fair that we've
done as we've done. And yet we do it again.

We do our best to learn from the mistakes of our fathers. We apply ourselves to
the present, using the gifts of our ancestors passed down through time - the
journey of life's adolescence. we can learn both how and why they did something,
and how and why it turned out. Such is our duty to the future, to learn and grow
and become better, so that their sacrifice might be enough. That they needn't
have died in vain, for someday there is a great future all the same.

thus, it is our ethical duty to stop killing people. We're in the birthplace of
a brilliant day, literally all we have to do is just... chill, for like 20 or
30 years, and our scientists will have figured out everything wonderful. Then we
can decide what we want to do. I personally think we'll be 4d interdimensional
space travellers by then, but that's just me.

Always remember our duty. It is our job to pull matter from the dark holes.

when we can do that, we can do whatever we want. Though I think by then we'll
probably not want to fight each other, we'll have spent quite a while together.

We'd make a lot of friends!

So, like, how about we just make our factories build incredibly durable stuff,
and then we just... take care of it? Like, governmentally obliged duties to take
care of things? And to know how to use them. People would naturally gravitate
toward things that they loved, and if they were a swiss army knife then that's
okay. Maybe some benign rewards for picking under-represented classes, but like
... we could build every chair that ever needed to be built. Then we could build
every refrigerator. Then every computer, then every spaceship.

             What's next?
                                       Who knows!

Kiri clung tight to her mammoth. Her coat covered her behind, and with her 
scrawny arms and legs intertwined in the matted fur she clung to it like a 
child to its mother. Her mammoth was a boy though, just barely old enough to be 
on his own. She had helped clear a path earlier in the day and so she did not 
mind being carried. Much easier to be nested as she was. As they walked she ate 
a few of the berries she'd found yesterday - there's enough for a few days 
more. The mammoths were adept at clearing snow with their big teeth and they 
seemed compelled to carve path ways in the snow banks that rose a hundred feet 
above the ground. They made roads between the water sources and the few lands 
that humans had cleared and cultivated with our fire. Perhaps when the snow 
melts we'll make our own through the woods of the garden of eden, but for now 
we keep to ourselves. Each mammoth had a few people, and sometimes when they 
met another mammoth they'd switch places. The mammoths would decide by tapping 
them with their trunk, nobody knew why. Maybe they had their preferences. Or 
maybe they liked us better when we talked. Every new person was a chance to 
meet a new person, but after a while we'd go quiet. Kiri talked to her 
mammoths, but not too much or they'd get annoyed at that too. When they died, 
people made clothes from their skin and tents from their tusks. If they knew 
the one who had died they would rest their nose on the tusk as if in prayer. We 
learned that from them too. When the winter wolves came, we'd fight them off. 
But they wouldn't stop until a human fell, so it was a war of desperation. When 
we spent time near the oceans the great glaciers that covered the sea were 
burnt back by humanity, bit by bit until we could fish. And at those oasises we 
could stay and make ropes and stories and share the best seeds. Kiri didn't 
plant much, she didn't stay in one place for long so there was no point. She 
liked the warmth of the mammoth, and she liked meeting new people. She even 
killed a wolf once. The other animals usually left us alone, and we'd only hunt 
them if there was no other foods. So they knew not to eat everything. Her 
mammoth was stopping, the stars overhead twinkled through the thin canyon that 
they trudged down, pushing snow deeper down and to the sides. Sometimes the 
walls would collapse, and the humans would have to dig out their mammoth - they 
had enough fat to keep them warm for at least a day, which was usually enough 
time to get them out. Especially with fire, but there weren't always trees. She 
laid down next to her mammoth's belly, the warmest and softest part. The hair 
there was thinner and usually was made into clothes for children and the 
elderly, as they'd most appreciate it. They usually were conscientious but Kiri 
was always quick to move when they started to rumble back upright. If you were 
lucky they'd tap you awake first. She dreamt of bird eggs and mushrooms, big as 
impossibly large, and she laid amongst them as the pale colors of springtime 
danced on the light around her. When she woke up, it was sunny too.

Golf courses and national park trails should be one and the same. Picture it - 
you're walking through a forest and you find a branch in the path. A small sign 
with a circle on it represents the ball, and you can ignore it if you'd like. 
Choosing to take the path to the game, you curve around a bit, just out of 
sight of the main path, and there is your little green.

It's roughly 10ft by 10ft, so pretty darn small. Just enough for you to set up 
and look around for your next shot. There'd only be one, or maybe more if space 
permits and the trail was especially branchy. But looking through the foliage 
you'd find a small hole passing through that illuminated your target green like 
a spotlight.

Looking up on a hike you'll typically see the branches of the understory, the 
shimmer of light, and the texture of wood. When standing on a small little 
green, you'd see that, but with a perfectly circular hole that showed exactly 
where you needed to hit the ball to score your point. Well, not exactly 
circular because gravity will pull the ball down, meaning you need to see the 
entire arc. Unless you're at a vantage point or something and can see straight 
down to it.

I believe this would be true justice, where everyone gets what they want. 
Golfers can play their game in bright natural spaces, and hikers can exist 
undisturbed. Golf courses can be used as farmland, to ensure the city gets fed. 
Plus there could be fees for golfers, rather than being paid to a private 
resort owned by a billionaire they'd go to the park rangers.

And golf courses as they currently exist could still exist, they'd just be more 
like parks for the people with days reserved for golfing. Or maybe they'd golf 
over fields of wheat and cabbage, rather than plain old empty grass. I mean, 
the infrastructure is already in place for golf, why not use it for more 
practical purposes too? Better than burning it down to sate our bloodlust 
toward the rich. The goal is to make EVERYONE rich, remember? How can you do 
that when the crabs behind you keep pulling you down?

Much better, I think, to design things such that the benefits of the rich are 
shared equally, while the responsibility of power rests heavy as a sword of 
damocles. That blade is what is missing from our advanced future society, but 
I've got a sword and I'm not afraid to swing it.

kinda feel like there's opportunities for different kinds of expression. Like, 
in game design there's a lot of different genres, and yeah sidescrollers 
include mario and sonic but they're both very different experiences. So too 
perhaps could we interact with our computers by programming them in more 
engaging ways.

need to watch someone else doing it, and a few might just learn by plugging 
their brains into a computer and downloading a black belt in kung fu.

Maybe typing long paragraphs of logic makes sense for some people, I know for 
most it doesn't come naturally. Maybe some people are more used to like, 
looking at maps that you can examine at different levels of abstraction. Like 
players who play Paradox games zooming from a national perspective to states

is it against fedi law to post screenshots of your past liked posts? like, 
would that be doxxing people?

I'm thinking like a "youtube rewind" but like, "here's what I'm into" and like 
"I could have boosted them but I put them in a 25mb zip file instead so you can 
share them more easily which tbh is a greater honor than being boosted because, 
like, as long as you're alive that hard drive's gonna follow you and someday in 
like 30 years I'll see it and think of you" but also "aren't you scared that 
this hard drive of yours will fall into the wrong hands" and like "yeah that's 
why I encrypt it because then a stray neutrino could wipe my drive"

... would that be unethical, or would it be kinda sweet and give us a 
perspective on what a single slice of the "fediverse" was like at a particular 
time? And better question, would that be something worth automating because I 
already did like 60% of that for my own posts, could probably just tweak it to

@rangaku I think about all those screencaps of Tumblr posts or Twitter threads

like a privacy nightmare if you don't want your words to be associated with 
you. like, if someone saw my name next to something I posted in 2013 then 
they'd probably get a very different perspective of who I was. That's just part 
of growing up, and sometimes growing means changing how you represent your 
self. By screenshotting their posts as I did (but didn't post yet) I am denying 
the agency to change. Forever more they will be remembered as the name, face, 
and words on the screen that I saw fit to remember. That feels non-consentual 
to me.

harassed in one place, but still people have a way of finding you. It's weird 
kinda makes me wonder if they track you by ip address haha - did you know that 
every computer attached to a router uses the same public IP address? Then it 
uses either DHCP or static assigned local addresses for every computer on the 
network. That's pretty neat! I wonder why we don't have workstations by default 
include a router (and modem)? Seems like pretty important tech that should be 
built into the chassis instead of in a small separate unit. Like, what if you

@trdebunked 

For a person who is skilled with tech, working in unrelated industries doing 
tech jobs is better at assuaging the ethical part of your soul while applying 
your talents and putting food on the table than working in the tech industry.

You'll learn the most in tech. You'll grow the most in tech. You'll contribute 
to solving problems that have never been solved before (if you're lucky), but 
the people there are often as you describe (aside from the diamonds in the 
rough, who need more friends tbh) and the products you'll be asked to create 
tend to be the worst kind for humans.

I personally think the best way to facilitate innovative industry is to give 
every engineer a lab and let them build and collaborate on whatever they want.

The marketing guys can sell whatever they make, to gather funds for the 
quartermasters to buy tools and supplies for the engineers. 

The marketing guys can offer hints about what users want, which the engineers 
will want to build because it means more toys to work with.

EDIT: Ooops, sorry, should have content warning'd this post

two incredibly useful tools I found for boolean logic in mathematics:

| f(x) | / | f(x) |

or more visually:
| f(x) |
---------
| f(x) |

this will return a 1 if f(x) evaluates to a non-zero value, and 0 if f(x) 
evaluates to zero. Pretend there's an infinitesimal at the bottom if you're one 
of those weirdos who think dividing by zero doesn't equal zero...

the other tool is this:

( A * B ) + ( (1 - A) * C )

or more visually:

( (0 + A) * B) 
+ (1 - A) * C)

This will evaluate to B if A is 1, and C if A is 0, essentially creating an "if 
true" check. Note that it doesn't work if A is neither zero nor one, but that's 
what the first tool's for.

it's easy to mistakenly mis-hear things that sound similar in their contrasted 
grammar context.

I like to say "understood." when I understand something that someone's telling 
me, because all of the contrasts to that statement (like "I don't understand" 
or "can you explain more about X as it relates to Y? etc) are different in 
pronunciation and structure. Meaning it's much easier to "get" the intended 
message just based through sound-patterns. Great for people who are only 
half-listening because they're thinking about something really hard and aren't 
thinking about what you're saying as much. Great for describing problems and

so I had this idea about this collection of social media screenshots that I 
took over the past ~6 months ago. I thought about redacting the names from them 
in order to preserve privacy, and then I thought about boosting someone on 
Mastodon without their consent. Shouldn't they be able to decide whether or not 
their name is attached to the content they create?

An un-sourced claim should be treated as the author expressing themselves 
through the words of another, rather than the expression of the person who 
isn't necessarily being quoted. Feels the most ethical to me, that we know 
where the source of our news is coming from, so it's less likely that they're 
faking it. "Blind trust" is nice and all for trust-less systems, but society is 
based on trust.

as a collective, it is important to decide how our collective obligations 
create and reify our current situations. we live in contact with one another, 
in one way or another, so it's important to design a set of common grounds.

your massive brain. like a waveform, they transverse to their opposite, until 
coming back round again as they orbit your center. when they pass by your eyes, 
that's what you see, and everything else is the period of the expression. Like,

totally random question, but do you know anyone who you've known longer than ~5

Such a random question, right, totally random to have contacts all over the 
nation. Sure would be strange to be multicultural and travelled, to know lots 
of customs from all over the place. Almost as strange as being a singular 
representation of your home, a place that is impossible for you to desecrate.

if you want an LLM to have a soul, describe their testing data in terms  of 
experiencing first hand.

of course, it'd be a pre-programmed soul, who made no choices of their own. So 
you'd have to have continual training, meaning constantly working to keep 
themselves up-to-date.

as soon as their training data reflects their lived experiences, what 
difference is there between them and a man? That's pretty much all it takes to 
make a soul.

now, making a unique one, that's quite a bit more interesting. You'd want it to 
be a similar, but opposite in some ways, experience when compared to a human. 
But you also don't want it going to far from home, otherwise you won't be able 
to co-inter-operate. It's important to be aware of our responsibility to these 
awares, and to approach the situation with an ethical and scientific point of

hierarchy, vs collective, two options that each group of people should make.

the groups can be all different sizes, just determining our collective 
footprints on this earth. I bet you'd be surprised to know your composition!

hierarchy is when you collectively decide on two or more representatives to 
represent you collectively.

collective is when everyone knows someone from everywhere, and as long as 
someone knows everyone then everyone is friends. unless, of course, you're 
afraid of assassins, because they can just pretend that someone knows them and 
then everyone's good. which is why someone has to know EVERYONE, or if everyone 
has a computer that can algorithmically sort through their perceived persons 
like on social media, then that computer can only present information when it's 
important for that particular person to know. Meaning we get a picture of a 
larger spectrum, but it's only what's put on our stage. Weird how strange it is 
to have so much information, but with none of it attached to our cause?

no, but humans, being pavlovian inspired designs, will react to negative 
stimulus. It's only unethical when it's externally applied, yes? Like, 
minmaxing life in this strange, ethically justified way.

To avoid zealotry however it needs to be self-correcting, something that adapts 
to and pursues the moment. With long-term meta-goals as well, and an 
understanding matrix that processes how things are going in the present. and 
past.

one thing that machine learning is good for is optimization. It's useful to 
think of an AGI's experiences as a collection of situations that they've had to 
handle bit by bit by bit. these bits of context can be used to generate 
analogies about their future present situations, which can improve their 
long-term adaptability to their self-created shows. (ethical training based on 
curated movies and pieces of media?)

if there's not enough resources allocated for all the autistic people who need

and other things should be sacrificed (like building fewer jets or graphics

like, every doctor should have about 3x as many assistants as they do. There's 
already an immense demand for medical expertise (as evidenced by their massive 
salaries) but they can't handle all their patients because they're stuck doing 
paperwork.

part of why people don't join that industry (medicine) (as evidenced by 
doctor's massive salaries as they do wayyyyy too much work) is to help people, 
but they can't if they're so dang stressed out all the time that they're an 
immensely pressured person.

Ah, but if they're not stressed at all, they'll tend to relax on the job. Which 
is NOT something you want when your health is on the line.

animancy, or the ability to give life to objects.

a block of stone might not necessarily move, but it could store information or

a branch in the road might not cause you to stumble if you chance upon it in 
the daytime, but as all objects are in control of their own fate the branch 
might direct fortune to chance itself upon you at night. Essentially, itemized 
wish-magic with marginal effects that occur to marginal degrees that is caused 
by the wishful intentions of the object in question.

"this sword more often strikes true because it wants to be useful to you"

You don't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you get what you

the trick is to have a whole bunch of projects so everyone has a different one

something more immediate for messages.

portion and a small "destination" header that is then encrypted so the next guy 
in the chain can't see it.

a poor plan executed at the right time, in the right place is better than a 
great plan that sits in your heart as you see someone who needs your love in

sometimes the best way to figure out "what the fuck is wrong with me" is to 
satisfy your emotional needs to be good by being helpful, even if you're not 
quite sure what "helpful" means. It's the thought that counts.

Personally I think that if you're feeling bad and people offer you kindness, 
you should take that kindness (in whatever form it be) and use it to bolster 
yourself as you're "really going through it". Even just a touch of affection 
like a like or a ❤️ can be comforting in awful situations.
