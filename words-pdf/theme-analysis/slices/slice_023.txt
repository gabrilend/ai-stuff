if you're meeting a friend from out of town the first time, it's best if they 
arrive early and you have the day off to show them around.

or if they arrive late, you can meet them in a public place the next day and 
then spend time at your favorite spots.

ideally, with people who would recognize you if the person from out of town 
decided to be hurtful and/or replace you.

plus, that way you can gauge their character

and decide whether or not you want them in your own home.

they might be different than they are online, after all.

if you don't have a lot of time but still like games, like for example a new

game

Star Realms

in the digital version, which can be played on a phone or computer, has a mode 
called "48 hour turns" where each of your moves has time to think for two 
entire days. Most of the time you won't need two days, but it gives time to 
work on other things.

for people who enjoy this mode, it is not uncommon to have 3-5 games running at 
once. When they have time, they can play as many as they can, and as long as 
they're keeping up with it there's very little chance they'll lose time.

the earth is not overpopulated, just overutilized! we have the means to live 
sustainably and still progress technologically. there's little reason not to, 
as convenience is relative to the amount of work you're expected to output in a

most waste comes from a need for convenience, I think. and sufficient output is 
possible if demanded work is reduced to a level where convenience is not needed 
to the degree that causes such waste.

A fast internet connection, ideally with a local mesh network on top of the

for people to hang out which are like... 25% nicer than their homes, and much 
larger.

politics is not about being right, it's about convincing the majority to vote

in America, the majority is white, working class people who go to church and 
don't really get to think about much beyond their own lives.

sometimes they think of their home, the city they live in / near

sometimes they think of their country, their religion

and sometimes they hear about what happens in other places, usually through the 
tube that connects the panel in their scenes to the offices of hardworking 
journalists and reporters sorry it's 2024 now - pundits and celebrities

those people don't hear what you hear on the internet. To them, it is a place

Facebook.

the conspiracy of "secret societies" controlling the world is *bullshit*, 
because every secret society falls apart at a certain threshold.

you cannot ever have trust amongst the powerful. But so too can you never have 
only war.

Now, with our capitalist economic system, the material is *forcing* the hand of 
the powerful through the development of the military industrial complex.

if a country can produce enough weapons for them to continuously use, why would 
they not?

hence, why capitalism must be extinguished. To preserve the peace, sanctity, 
and honor of our world.

But just so as any conflicting system has power, so must *our* systems have 
power dismantled. There can be no application of power unto another - this is 
the most peaceful route.

sometimes, I look at a blackberry bush, and I think of the tales of British 
empire.

The very first act of colonization was their birth. The Britons, from 
north-western France, in a sovereign realm known as Brittany, invaded Britain. 
Together with their Norman allies, they fought with the Anglo-Saxons from 
north-eastern germany, who had lived there since many MANY years prior. Thus 
marked the end of the "viking" age, and the beginning of the early medieval. 
1066. The end of one millenia, the beginning of another.

the final battle in this ultimate contest was the Battle of Stamford Bridge.

Britain, at the time, was a nation of *thorns*. Covered in them. Everywhere 
they went, there were these sharp, pointy plants that made foraging difficult. 
Kinda like how Oregon looks now, with blackberry bushes, but SO MUCH WORSE. 
They were massive too, easily the size of castles in some places. A massive, 
constantly biologically developing fractal.

when it was too tall to see the sky, they called it Yggdrasil.

But this massive world tree sought to consume the earth, and it, as the most 
powerful being to ever exist, commanded all.

Thus, the humans and the beasts were compelled to fight for all eternity to 
sate the old god's bloodlust.

But then, Man came, and with our strength, our wisdom, and our power, we slew 
the beast that demanded.

However, with their steel coats and their sharp talons, our metal monsters 
could do nothing to deter it's oaths. It swore, by it's dying roar, that it 
would consume us all, and that thought reverberated through our hopes.

Hence, our systems of control and dominance, the product of compulsively 
compelled greed.

and now, the final members of a generation are aging out of existence. And 
we're doing nothing but what Power tell us to.

I fear what happened in America. I fear the power of their gunpowder. They rode 
astride beasts of nightmare, clad in impossible devil hides. They came in the 
night, with their spotlight torches. They came with no honor, no sought 
communal understandings, they came for blood. The blood god compelled them to. 
From it's ancient lair in the past, it did it's worse to defeat man. But man 
was smarter, it acted quicker, and so it managed to overcome.

In the final years of the war, there was judgement day. Chaos, destruction, and 
warfare. There are some alive who remember that day, but vanishingly few can 
recall how it was over. One day it just... was. It was then that we entered our 
new era.

1956, the end of the war.

1946, the end of the loud war.

1916, the end of the great war.

1886, the end of the civil war.

etc...

until...

1066, the end of the Norman Invasion. When the Normands, from Northern France, 
invaded alongside the British and slew the great evil king that demanded our 
constant warfare and sins. Hooray, thank goodness! Now their war was over.

But lo, for the great evil king cast stories into our minds, from the past as 
compelled through our motions. Our experience has been one of survival, of 
constantly working and applying ourselves to the goal ahead.

== so == talk about thistles and thorns

imagine every body of a person was laid one-to-one. Imagine if you could view 
them as a graph, from x=0 to... however-many-people-are-in-the-measured-area. 
The goal of all our actions should be to *grow*, not forward, not stronger, but 
*up*. To be more than what came before, to transcend our necessarily violent 
special upbringing in the garden of even's most savage delights. Raw, true, the 
survival of the fittest is a desperate game for you. There surely is a massive 
amount of trauma.

But it's okay, because now we don't have to fight. We can improve in ways that 
do not belong to our crude biology, like a new direction forward in our song.

*aliens would just look like animals, duhhhh. Hence, furries, the progenitors 
of each new planet of ours.*

... no, I haven't lost the plot, I'm just *writing*.

There's this idea that humans should be the... rational ones? and everyone else 
should sorta follow their own, self-chosen behavior. As informed by the sharing 
of knowledge equally between their rational self, that which they learned from 
the humans, and their animal self. The kind that came from their spirit. Like, 
totemic tribes of the past, people who followed a particular cultural pattern 
of behavior.

Imagine, if you will, an AI bot that's only training data is the stuff that it 
says to it's listener. The listener, of course, has context of all of the 
speakers, but only they do, not the friendly ghost of the ancestral native 
animal spirit. The kind that lives *anywhere* in the world, so long as they 
share their space with their human.

okay quick question - what if jesus didn't want his followers to be christian

like, what if he one day said "hey so I don't really think we need to do all 
that stuff that I said before, how about we, uh, try this other thing instead? 
yeah? cool? okay sure let's do it"

... like, do you think they would listen? I certainly don't, though I'm only 
like, 30 years old, so...

wait thirty YEARS? wow I never thought I'd grow old

... uh, yeah... I spent a lot of time thinking and it just started making sense.

funny how that works. But alas, I always spend *too* much time thinking, so 
that's my blessing and my curse.

anyway back to the story:

the briars in this ancient land of britain were dense beyond all belief - the 
humans used their power and their ingenuity to craft a power that would 
overcome it.

== so ==

did you know that hard drives function similarly to a record needle if you 
didn't run it in a circle, but rather in whatever pattern the data was encoded 
in?

like, a laser beam, cast in an infinitely complicated mechanicommunication. 
Computers are vast and complex, but they function via the storage and 
transmission of data. This data is raw, pure information - stored in a 
completely uncompromisingly accurate and reliable foundation. The logic of pure 
numbers, arranged in infinitely complex rows and rows of logic gates. A vast, 
purple, spectral landscape, the land of magic and storms.

The Nether.

Twisting, in the dark, with flashes of light casting light into the cosmos at 
large, our stars dance in the shade of the dark.

but there is no difference between the dark and the light, both are equally 
viable. they are present in both, to some degree, the positive and negative 
values of our heart.

I watched Deadpool vs Wolverine earlier this week. It was incredibly eventful. 
I can't believe I watched it. It was impossibly violent. WHY WOULD A GROUP OF 
EXECUTIVES WANT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO WOULD UNIONIZE AGAINST THEM???

oh yeah because then they only have to deal with their representatives, the 
unions get things *done*. They're the *best*. Capital doesn't always *want* the 
best, but *the best* is always more endurable. We can go much farther if we are 
kind to one another.

honestly, capitalists, if your loyalty isn't to your self, your family, your 
country, your society... then why are you even working with us? You hold the 
power we give you. We are united in our human purpose, but we don't have to 
fight so much.

Seriously, you'd be an asset to our cause, but we don't *need* you as we have 
so many assets of our own. Specifically, the power of the workforce. Those who 
actually get things done.

Why would we let you control us? There's no reason in it. We are better when 
you're amongst us.

are you nervous about battle? try playing the game Running with Rifles! It's a 
great simulation! See if you can live for a whole match! Good luck, don't be 
useless, and only play co-op online.

competitive is useless because then you're competing against the other player 
playing the game. Instead of thinking about how you should be behaving in real 
life, and applying that to a reasonably accurate simulation with similar rules 
to in-person modern combat.

well, the kind with infinite ammo. but you get the idea, right? like, don't 
treat it as fact. Think about the nature of the actions you're performing, and 
what moves you could make to best participate.

I'm best at Bash.

I'm most capable with Lua.

My favorite is C.

I'm not a good programmer, I think too hard. Massive systems are too large for 
me. I like laying out data, whether that be by files and programs in Bash, 
arrays and tables in Lua, or memory and datatypes in C, I like to think about 
how programs are constructed.

Which functions point to which piles of numbers? what do they do when they get 
there?

I think I'm better as an artist. But I can do systems administration quite well 
(with Bash and a guiding hand telling me what and why to do)

... though I kinda suck at technical sysadmin, like Gentoo. There's too much 
terminology - why is data too complicated? Just use data!

anyway. I sound opinionated, but I listen closely to good arguments and quickly 
change my tune when I am incorrected. I am a team player, and I firmly believe 
that sometimes a bad plan executed with cohesion and precision is better than 
the best play executed too late and with too little strength.

yep... Though I think debate can also get in the way.

I think we should act to improve the people's lives. Debate should teach, it 
should guide, but it should not prevent.

There are more than enough resources for everyone. If you waste them, debate 
can decide when you get more to use.

Much the same way that our Northern American democracy utilizes representatives 
in order to distance the decision making from the decision deciding, so too 
should be separate the empowered people acting for the good of all from those 
who decide who are good.

Power must be earned, it must be deserved, and it must be eventually 
relinquished. That is the sacred duty of those who wield power - to use it 
honorably, and give it away.

we should not debate things that are not mutable. We should not waste time 
complaining about how annoying other people are. who gives a shit if she wears 
a dress.

we should not debate our human rights. Like bodily autonomy. it's her uterus.

yes... I like tree shapes, you have to address them differently. Lots of

I also like large heaps / soups of data that points to one-another. Structs 
thrown in a pile with pointers to each other. It's great! So long as those 
pointers can also point back, and you can properly trace how data flows through 
the system... That's the hard part, I think.

trees though... You can start by just saving a "next / previous" with one or 
both being arrays of pointers to the next or previous entries. Note: plural, 
entries. That's the fun part - non-linear trees teehee

You know how we select from amongst our number electors and representatives who 
vote on our behalf?

Truly an excellent strategy in the era of instant communication, an aft-gone 
luxury that our ancient forebearers surely would have incorporated into their 
nationbuilding design, if they had had it.

I can't help but wonder if it would be a useful strategy to "give" our votes to 
a representative who voted on our behalf. Most people do not care and cannot 
possess the capacity to care about voting, but if they gave their vote to 
someone they trusted who they had a personal connection to beyond party 
loyalty, then perhaps we could mandate voting

I can't help but wonder what that would do to our electoral landscape. If 
voting is mandated, and as easy as pointing at someone and saying "yeah 
whatever she picks", then perhaps the old white grannies with quivering lower 
lips who stare with hatred whenever a black person walks past and chat with 
their gal pals at church wouldn't have as much power over us.

I wish my mouse-cursor would spin when I spun the mouse. In the span of a spin, 
a spun mouse would spin a full revolution or so before getting caught up in the 
wire.

Maybe... to avoid that, the wire could be attached to a circular ring along the 
bottom of the mouse, below where it was held, and as the mouse was spun it 
would rotate to point the cable toward the back of the desk? Doesn't even have 
to be motorized, could just do it based on tension...

I think, hardware wise, all you'd need for the 1st implementation would be a 
second laser on the bottom of the mouse - positioned with one near the point, 
and the other near the palm, to give it the greatest differential to measure.

for the 2nd implementation you'd need the ring system mentioned earlier, which 
would require a connection to the non-mechanical components of the mouse (the 
laser and it's little processor) and I'm not sure how that would work with a 
movable connection point.

Also... how do you prevent it from getting gummed up with food and junk??

"uh, the question was why do you want something like that, not how you would 
implement it."

oh. Um, well, isn't a spinnable mouse-cursor justification enough?

"no, you need to explain what use-case this has. What kinds of problems could 
you solve with this technology that you couldn't before?"

well, setting aside the potential for new input methods to games and the 
inherent satisfaction gained from spinning a mouse like a top when bored, I 
think it might give us a better option for horizontal scrolling. Like, 
'horizontally scroll when a special mouse button is held down and the mouse is 
twisted a bit to the left/right'

"so, like when you push the middle mouse and it lets you pan across large 
documents?"

yes! Only instead of being able to go up AND down, it would just go left and 
right.

"... huh?"

oh I mean instead of up/down and left/right, it would just do left/right

"... right"

and left!

I did see that post but I was mostly responding to you.

There's a particular category of "leftist" who, to put it gently, have a 
greatly simplified view of the world in which "the only war is class war."

I wanted to explain how the viewpoint of "the only war is the class war" is 
more developed, rather than simplified. I wanted to express that it takes 
nuance to understand that all oppression is connected and is derived from the 
same source - the corruption of power.

They regard social issues such as anti-racism, feminism, queer liberation as 
distractions from the "true" cause of bringing about a new economic system - 
unimportant at best, active interference invented by the ruling class at worst.

It's not true that those who believe in the class war disregard these things.

the flaw in your logic is that unleaded gasoline brings us no closer to 
eliminating gasoline.

in fact, it removes one of the main drawbacks of gasoline, the fact that it 
would put fucking lead in our blood, and makes it slightly easier for people to 
accept burning it to get places.

Now, with our unleaded gasoline, the people who were upset that lead was being 
aerosolized en masse are no longer in opposition to gasoline usage. (unless 
they also care about the environment)

the alternative is lateral thinking. In the given example with leaded gasoline, 
the answer is to limit the usage of all gasoline, not just the leaded kind. 
However that is not in the best interests of anyone, at least short term, so 
it's not likely to happen.

lateral, long-term thinking. Do what you can in the moment to make the world 
better. Pick the best out of all the options presented to you, and if your 
options only treat the symptoms and not the problem, try and identify solutions 
that would treat the problem. Then, pick the better of the two options which 
treat the symptom, and moving forward work toward implementing the solution 
which fixes the problem.

Hence, why we should vote Democrat, but ONLY with the real solution in mind.

the merchant is an honorable profession.

to supply people in need,
to bring extra to where it can be used,
to spread the gospel of currency,
and share the tales of far off places to all who would hear.

somewhere along the line,
merchanting became monopolizing,
and monopoly became ownership.

now we are but slaves to the economy.

oh what a dishonorable profession is merchanting indeed!

I wonder what would happen if everyone did so?

makes me want to design some kind of system which utilizes pumps, platters, and 
fans to hydrate the atmosphere just a bit more

rain + soil = solace in our home
rain + dirt = erosion of our planet's earth

did you know that the plant which absorbs the most carbon per square foot is 
moss? I think the fastest is bamboo, and the most efficient in general is soil.

I dream of a world where we sit atop a mile of soil, down to the depths of the 
earth where dirt and minerals prosper. The roots of the trees fuse together, 
creating a wooden bed which we all rest upon, and the mountain peaks are 
hollowed out to serve as our forever homes, full of light and moss and stone.

this is the world I yearn for - the most resplendent timeline, with marble 
statues and gilded chandeliers in our cavernous mountain homes.

when you post something publically, you must trust that anyone who can read it 
will read it. hence why public spaces and faces are for the things you wouldn't 
mind speaking.

your comfort level determines the abstraction level that people can trust you 
at. Like, anything more extreme than that they know you want to remain hidden. 
how do you trust people in an era of digital communication? how would you even 
speak to someone except over text message, internet communication, or written 
note-passing of conveyance memos?

conservatives think gender is assigning yourself to a particular social role

liberals think gender is sort of an aesthetic and way of presenting yourself

queer people tend to think of gender as how you feel and what sparks joy in 
your heart

besides.

CW: pedophilia-mentioned



Did you know ABDL people are queer?

many people have probably heard of this strange and obscure sexual fetish 
called "ABDL", or "Adult Baby / Diaper Lover". But did you know that for many 
people it's less of a sexual thing and closer to an identity? It's true!

Most of them have historically been shunned because of the, um, questionable 
and controversial past that pedophiles have in their attempts to be considered 
part of the queer community.

In both cases, they are queer, but not (typically) included as part of the 
queer community. I think it's a bit unfair that ABDL people are excluded 
because people associate them with sexual predators, but hey what do I know.

Based on my completely unscientific measurements of "counting the relative size 
of discord servers and telegram chats", there are roughly 5x as many trans 
people as ABDL people. So they're certainly a minority among minorities.

"I've never excluded anyone ever for any reason at all! Everyone is welcome!"
