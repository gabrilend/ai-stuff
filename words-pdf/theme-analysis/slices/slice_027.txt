@burnoutqueen 

our stems are grown from the same nutrients, the same soil, the same climate

but we blossom differently, and we should live in an ecosystem co-interactively.

I don't really use labels that much. Hence why I clarified in the original 
post. I think they're primarily useful for academic purposes, not for 
organizational ones.

At the end of the day, people are people, and we meet and greet in much the 
same way.

@banaanihillo 

There's 4 shoulder buttons, L1, L2, R1, and R2, so you can push one of those to 
swap between screens. You can also push another one to swap between top on the 
left, bottom on the right, and top on the right, bottom on the left, and a 
third mode where there's only one screen shown.

Of course, the easiest to play games are the ones that only really use one 
screen, or where switching between them isn't that big of a deal (turn based 
games for example)

the touch-screen uses one of the analog sticks, and it's... not BAD, but it's 
not the best.

However, for games like Final Fantasy 3 it's great!!

African Americans have done more than enough to be considered native to

I am currently in the stages of applying to work at a multinational corporation 
primarily located outside of America. It is a respectable institution that 
commands great respect.

However, I am borderline incapable. If I am chosen to work there, I *will* fail 
and I *will* embarrass America on the world stage. I am not one of our best, 
nor am I one of our brightest and boldest. I have *unique* perspectives, and 
those are *valuable*, but the society and the systems I find myself in has 
proven incapable of utilizing me to my utmost potential.

I must work. I cannot work. But I must. I am disabled. But I must be able. 
Capitalism compels it.

Would that our system could be something consensual. I am worth more as a 
writer than a laborer. Yet laborers are the only ones being hired.

I am not an engineer. I enjoy engineering.

I am not a laborer. I enjoy labor.

I am a writer, and perhaps little else besides.

When I die, nothing remains of me but my bones. My words are not desired. My 
life is not impactful. I am not special.

Well... Not special since I have given up cannabis. If I started smoking weed, 
if I felt secure and enough to do so, perhaps I might utilize my instability 
for great (GREAT) artistic ends.

But art is labor. And labor is difficult.

Where am I to go from here? I cannot pay rent. I am isolated and alone. I am 
deprived of affection. I crave it. I am lost in my own heart, begging the world 
to give me a start, but the start has passed long ago. There is nothing to do 
but what I've been meant to do, what I've been hiding from myself and the 
world. I have been wasting my talent on tweets. How mundane.

... I can do better than profane.

when I think of crowd sizes, I don't think "we're winning! hooray!" I think 
"okay so what are they up to, where are those people, what caused them to 
disappear, are they busy or are they dead" because questions like that provide 
strategic value, while statements like "we're winning! hooray!" improve morale. 
I'm not in charge of morale. I'm not in charge of anything, but mostly because 
I'm too public for that kind of thing. Morale is important, it's perhaps the 
MOST important thing. But strategy is also important, and must not be

what if instead of sending "cease and desist" notices, corporations sent "hey 
you need to transition to publicly owned assets" notices?

if progress is slow, they can pour funding into the project. If they're 
intentionally going slow and not meeting their reasonable deadlines, then they 
can be sued, and that's a whole process during which the "cease and desist"-ed 
project can't legally be used by anyone.

the deadlines are set based on the scope of the project and the capabilities of 
the team, capabilities which may be augmented by the infusion of dosh by the 
parent company.

At the end, the product must be completely publicly owned, as in 
free-and-open-source, so that they cannot be allowed to compete with the parent 
company - instead, they may be used by the parent company, without requiring an 
open source license going forward for their version.

CW: education~



A child's schooling should consist of the bare-minimum amount of mental labor 
necessary to teach them the fundamentals of arithmetic, reading, and writing.

They must be given opportunities to apply themselves toward educational goals 
beyond such things, including social proficiency, and physical dexterity and 
strength, and specialization in a particular academic subject.

Kids need freedom. They need community, not "social time" that does not consist 
of anything more than living in the same rooms at school as the other kids. 
They need to be able to visit each other whenever they want.

I personally believe that lectures taught in an interesting and engaging way 
are significantly more effective at instilling a drive to learn than rigorous 
drilling of detailed information. A kid will not learn a sufficient amount of 
information in school to be useful in a particular topic unless they seek out 
the knowledge on their own. Universities attempt to "fake" this effect by 
getting them to research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This month, I was diagnosed with Schizotypal disorder. I had a single hour to 
talk to a psychiatrist (thank you, insurance) and he explicitly told me that my
diagnosis was preliminary.

Schizotypal is a type of neurodivergence similar to autism but with elements of
schizophrenia (paranoia, delusional and / or magical thinking) and my 
presentation includes ADHD symptoms such as difficulty focusing. When medicated,
I have difficulty concentrating, however the paranoia and delusional thinking is
suppressed. The treatment plan is ongoing and developing.

These issues have been present for the entire time I've been at WGU, and before.
However, I am seeking treatment now because I had begun to have difficulty 
maintaining a job and keeping a home.

Currently, my medication is working. However the greatest issue facing me right
now is financial problems - I couldn't maintain a job while unmedicated, and 
frankly while medicated I am still having difficulty for different reasons. 
However the intent is to refine the medication choices to find a solution that 
works for me. However, employment is still a concern, and so I have requested
and been approved for a term break of at least 2 months with the option to 
extend. During this term break I intend to resolve the financial issue however 
I can. Ideally in such a way that will allow me to apply myself toward school 
work.

This degree is important to me. Without it, I won't be able to find employment
in the tech industry aside from technician roles. My previous experience with
them has given me experience, and I learned quite a bit... Until I ran out of
things to learn. I do not believe I could handle that type of work long-term for
various reasons. In the short term, I may attempt it but I am convinced that I
will burn out quickly.

I currently feel as if I am disabled. I don't know if it's true, perhaps I'm 
just going through a rough patch. But once my savings hit zero, I'm out on the
streets, and I won't live long like that.

When thinking about whether or not I'll be able to complete my degree, I 
honestly cannot give you an answer. I've been in higher education for over a 
decade, surely I should have finished by now. But I cannot get over various
hurdles it seems, and frankly I have no idea why. It's... Maddening, to see 
yourself, so full of potential, yet chained to the form and circumstances you 
are given. I wonder what choices might I have made differently to avoid my fate,
if it truly is my fate to fail in this way, but I have no answers.

I am intelligent, of this I am certain. I know more about computers than anybody
I know, and I would love to apply myself toward them. But I lack a degree, so I 
cannot be seen by recruiters and hiring managers. I try to work on my degree,
but I find the words on the page grow dense like the forest between the trees,
and I cannot see a way through to reach new understandings. Why do I keep 
learning these things? I already know what a callback function is, what 
interfaces are used for, how to implement safe multithreading in a parallel 
environment, I know how networking protocols interact with hardware and how the
airflow through a case affects the thermals of a computer's internals. I've 
grown crystallized in my knowledge, it seems, due to the endless pursuit of 
these foundations. I think I would excel in the higher-level courses, but... I
can't get there. I crave the insights that might be learned in a master's
degree, but my brain is not wired for homework. I'm not built to cram for tests,
to learn someone's else's tools and frameworks. I don't know what I could be
doing better, it feels like I'm so alone. I guess it's my own fault for picking
an online school, but WGU is the best of the online schools, and I needed online
because I move around a lot. Well... I used to. My boyfriend moved around a lot,
but now he's my ex-boyfriend. Oh well.

... Anyway you can probably see why I have difficulty with school. It's 
difficult for me to stay on track. I can start working on my project 5 or 6 
times in a day and make marginal at best progress, and each time it hurts more
and more to return. I don't have an answer, but I don't know what to do if not 
to pursue my degree. I feel as if I'm on the brink of despair in my life, and if
you read these appeals often, I imagine you hear that a lot.

I will apply myself more to my coursework. Once I find a job, I will give 
everything to my school, even as it breaks me. I am... intense, and I feel 
strongly that I must get this degree. Between it and me, there is quicksand, but
I must get through.

Thank you for your consideration. I understand however you decide. If I can knab
a decent job, I might be able to pay for my degree myself, given a couple months
to save up for it. But I highly doubt I could find such a thing in this economy
and this life I do lead.

Please consider me, I will accept any aid that is offered.

If you have a thousand options in your case / switch statement, you should 
probably refactor.

consider putting function pointers (to the things you would have switched to) 
in an array and instead of checking "if this enum, then this, if that enum, 
then that" etc send an index into the function pointer array. That way there's 
no branching at all.

The best way to generate performant code is to reduce or eliminate branches. If 
you're working on a video game or networked program, this can be incredibly 
important.

The second best way is probably reducing cache misses and increasing 
parallelism, but those are different problems.

well, the idea is that they would handle all the tech debt and merge requests 
and bugfixes and such - the kind of things that aren't very interesting to work 
on. That way, the people who are most dedicated and passionate for the project 
have a way to clear out their backlog and start as if from scratch.

Plus, if they later don't understand how or why something was implemented, they 
could always message the person who implemented it and say "hey why did you do 
it this way I had it this other way before" and then they could reply and say 
"oh yeah because of this-and-this system we implemented for these-or-that 
caching reasons related to integer flow through the syncretic binary op-code 
delimiter" and then actually wait no maybe you're right, I see what you mean

well... they don't have to merge everything if they don't want to. They could 
just... ignore the parts that people worked on that they don't want to include 
in the project. I'm thinking it'd be an opt-in thing too, so someone could 
request it!

I don't want power, I want *control*, over my own life at least, and at most 
whatever I am suited to designing.

And in order to prevent control from becoming power, it must not only be 
decentralized and distributed amongst all who are impacted by it, said control 
must also be paired with a burden of responsibility. 

There must be no malice in judgement, no fear in foresight, no hatred in 
organizing. This is the responsibility of those who would hold unnatural power 
over others - the kind that are bourne on the contracts and procedures of 
institution.

If the powerful do not seek to relinquish it, then perhaps they do no deserve 
it. And yet a nation of Cincinnatuses would surely fall to weakness, as the 
strength that they covet is replaced by whoever they can get to fill the role. 
Not ideal.

Instead, a human should *revel* in their strength. The will to power is the 
will to passion, and passion is intrinsically human.

However, power corrupts, and all humans should seek to avoid corruption, or at 
least to keep it at bay. To do so, a person must consider their impulses and 
listen to the words of the unspoken for. Only then may they overcome the perils 
of control without reason.

'em, until they are given the chance to consider, and they choose to consider.

It's very difficult to maintain hatred when presented with the possibility of 
consideration. But those kind of people typically never have that opportunity.

There are strategic goals and top down goals.

Strategy is the domain of the execs. They must be as general as possible and 
justify their existence. They are the glue, the connectors, the people who know 
who to talk to in order to get things done.

Tactics are the realm of the workers. They must be capable, dependable, honest 
and fair. They must diligently realize the goals of the strategic plan using 
whatever means they deem fit to address the tactical situation at hand. The 
more freedom they have, the more effective they are.

These two forces are pitted in contest under capitalism. Under socialism, they 
are orthogonal to one another. Not a pyramid, but a cylinder on its side, 
growing from its base on one end to its zenith at the other.

They are allies. They are similar, but distinct. Their roles may overlap at 
times, or perhaps not if they should not desire it. A person should be able to 
work wherever they like. They are the best judges of their capabilities.

There are only so many resources, and if we vote on their distribution we'll 
give enough for everyone to share. And then we'll run out. Unless, of course, 
we *demand* sustainablity. Long-term, and ignoring profit but rather seeking to

after all, according to their own capitalist theory, money is just an

most efficient" is just as useful as the money that actually describes the 
"flow" of goods and services through the made-up economy

so surely we could abolish currency and simply utilize an interest based 
economy based on what we're naturally drawn to as humans, right? Oh wait WALL-E

I had a dream last night where a bunch of people were at a work party and they 
received a letter from the "higher ups" that said something along the lines of:

"to combat the threat of your unionization efforts, we have decided to take the 
company in a different direction. We've rebranded ourselves as a company by and 
for [alt-right cis dude-bros] and everyone who doesn't fit in will be given 
increasingly difficult workloads until they quit, because we don't want you 
around.

In addition, our long-term vision statement has changed toward our ultimate 
goal of cloning famous sith lords from history (starting with Count Dooku) and 
working to build a new empire of the darkside. We look forward to working with 
you in the future. Sincerely, your bosses."

they went to the boss who wrote it and said "is this real or a joke" and he 
said it was real, so then like 6 people took out battleaxes and fucking 
murdered him in cold blood.

... Dreams are weird.

I always disappear right when you need me the most because you're supposed to 
take the next step.

The reason I do that is because...? You fill in the blanks. Tell me why I do 
that. I know, and I want you to know, but I can't say it.

Internationalize amazon and walmart and you'll have fixed most of the problems 
of globalism.

But you can't fix anything if you don't have power...

It's important to focus on how to get power. Keep in mind "what to do when you 
have power" but don't let it dominate your thoughts. Focus on claiming your 
right to determination.

Steps to revolution:

1. Invert power structures with unions 
2. Care for people with mutual aid 
3. Vote for the Democrat so we have a few more years of peace 
4. Teach people to always be learning
5. Connect to people on a personal or spiritual level 
6. Make the world a better place, whether that's by sweeping a street corner or 
helping people smile, it doesn't really matter how. What matters is the 
intention.
7. Improve your self and your life. Do pushups, eat better, drink more water, 
spend time writing (writing is thinking), and take time to sit and stare at the 
flowers.
8. Kill the part of yourself that cringes. Everyone's figuring things out and 
its okay to say "haha okay then"
9. Spend time with animals.
10. Make mistakes. Apologize for them. Learn from them. Stay mobile in your 
character. Develop new ways of being.
11. React with vigor when the time comes. This vigor will only be violent if it 
is caused by violence. Much more likely is a strength through organization. We 
can do it if we do it together!
12. Show up every day, but don't hang around if everyone's resting at home. 
It's okay to stop showing up if things are on pause.
13. Trust that your allies are working. Or resting. Or preparing.
14. Plans change, planning remains.
15. Dream of a better future. It is within reach.

some people prepare for revolution like a boy gets ready for a party

others do so like a girl packing for a weekend trip to vegas

I do it like a kid who forgot the paper was due on monday in 7th period and so 
spends their entire lunch period writing it (missing 4th in the process because 
the conclusion paragraph was giving me difficulty)

I love next word predictors!

AI? What's that? Oh you mean this next word predictor I can run locally on my 
computer
and use for a millionth of a cent of electricity per minute?

... you didn't mean the kind of next word predictors you can run locally and 
use cheaply, did you? When you said AI you meant the kind that takes half of a 
datacenter to build a shopping list, right? the kind that is offered for free 
in order to generate interest and fund development of next word predictors 
which are executed at scale and which can predict next words so accurately and 
so well tuned that people can't help but imagine they're conscious. That kind, 
that's the kind of next word predictor you meant when you said AI, right?

yeah that kind sucks. I mean yeah it's good at what it does but if a 
next-word-predictor costs more than a car to build and more than a bottle of 
water to run once, then maybe it's a little bloated. Maybe it's a little 
inefficient. Maybe it's big enough to be nationalized.

"I'm not really a designer, though."

what about that desk you designed?

"oh, yeah I guess that counts. I haven't gotten around to building it though so 
I'm not a real designer."

what! don't say that, you designed it didn't you? How about this - I know this 
girl who wants to be a carpenter but she doesn't have any idea what kind of 
projects to work on. How about I put you two in a room together and she can 
build your desk. If it goes well, I can hook you up with someone who organizes 
designers and he can get you into a furniture design course at the library.

"Hmmmm, well that seems alright. But I don't really want to work with people! I 
mean, I don't know her - what if she doesn't like me?"

oh, she can be a little spicy sometimes, but I'm sure you'll hit it off. Just 
don't mention rats, she had a pet pass away recently and she's still a little 
broken up about it.

oh, I just heard about this project over in west kansatexahoma for a massive 
solar panel installation. Apparently they're doing some water purification with 
the excess energy too?

"that sounds pretty interesting, but I was thinking I could do something in the 
area?"

ah, that's fine too. The good news is that you can do whatever you'd like to. 
there will be training provided for everything and nobody is turned away, so... 
what would you like to do?

"I'm not really sure. What needs doing?"

well, there are several categories of tasks that need to be done.

food, housing, maintenance, and logistics.

depending on your skillset, you can contribute to each of those in different 
ways. You were in recycling before, which is logistics.

"Hmmm, I'm feeling housing this time."

Right, that's easy enough. You wanted to use your brain, right? Well, how about 
an event coordinator? Or maybe an environmental designer?

"Hmmm, I don't really want to work with people"

I see. Architect, maybe?

"I think I'm going to quit my job at the recycling center. Everyone there is 
just a little too catty for me. I think they like the verbal sparring but it 
just gets a little tiresome after a while."

oh, sorry to hear that. Well if you still want to help out there's plenty of 
work to do. I could set you up at another recycling center nearby too, if you'd 
like...?

"well, I like the idea of universal recycling. It was a little annoying when 
people would put food waste in with the clothing donations, and this one time I 
found like 8 bags of cat litter inside of a washing machine. Spent like an hour 
vacuuming everything out, which... actually wasn't bad. Kinda felt a little 
cathartic to clean it so thoroughly."

"on the other hand I would like to use my mind a bit more, my creative projects 
are kinda in a slump so I figure I could use my body at home and my mind at 
work. I've been meaning to build a desk out of some spare hardwood I snagged at 
work but I haven't gotten around to it."

"yes that's true! we ended up driving cars to do our grocery trips. It was a 
little wasteful but I kinda liked the feeling of driving a car? It became 
normal after a while but now that driving is rarer I still miss it."

suburban socialist future:

need groceries? walk down the street until you find a car, then drive it to the 
store. There's room for like, 10 cars there because the rest of the space has 
been taken up by market stands. Inside the stores themselves are mostly storage 
but you can walk through them if it's raining. When you need to go home, take a 
different car and leave it in your driveway.

going on a trip? walk around until you find the right kind (a truck for 
camping, for example, or a gas car for interstate travel) then put it in your 
garage and close the door. That way you can reliably have it in the morning.

why do we own cars? when they were scarce, people coveted them. They were 
status symbols. But... people are people, who cares about what objects they 
surround themselves with?

"but Ritz I really like my car" - okay then spend your garage on it. I think 
most people would rather have a place in the shade where they can spend time 
with their neighbors, but what do I know.

@burnoutqueen 

today I had someone ask me for an apology. They've asked several times before, 
and each time I've only been able to give them a half-apology - I apologized 
for being persistent, but not for being impulsive, and that wasn't good enough.

I can't help being impulsive! I'm adventurous! I crave excitement and joy!

But I'm sorry that I pushed him too hard. I'm sorry I hurt him. And... 
apparently that's not good enough. He doesn't want me in his life, he can't 
fucking let it go. And he calls me selfish. Says I don't respect him, based on 
one night out of 5 years where I tried too hard to get him to enjoy life.

I'm sorry I can't fix your depression, guy, but like, at least I tried. You 
could have at least tried the things I suggested. You could have at least tried 
to follow my advice.

whatever.

it was literally just a walk in the park

... anyway I am often wrong. I often correct my past self. I always apologize 
for hurting people, but I never apologize for doing what I believe is right.

people? oh yeah I know "people". they're all a bunch of bastards.

good, bastards are the best fighters

not if your fight relies on fighting for something you believe in. There's a 
zero percent chance that you'll get everyone to believe the same thing because 
people naturally gravitate toward filling the idea space equally and finding 
niches to fit themselves into

ha true - thinking of successful revolutions of the past, they've always been 
caused by material conditions creating insufficiencies that must be resolved 
through violence. and then, the people fighting can all agree on something like 
"we must have bread" or... actually that's pretty much the main thing people 
need

and yeah, sure, wealth inequality is unjust, but they're careful to only take 
enough to ensure that we're sufficiently placated.

but they're always taking more, and someday soon they'll take too much.

that's how mastodon works. gotta keep posting until you find your people. 
comment on things, boost things, and read through people's profile pages.

this is the place to be annoying, because "annoying" is really just "weird" and
