one section of the government consistently and succeedingly telling another 
part what to do is a coup-like behavior. if the rules mean nothing, then what 
is your job even for?

hence, why the rules mean something. Because your job is important. It's 
building up our capabilities as the human race.

you don't have to work to live. you shouldn't, and you won't. it's not your 
place to labor. know why? because nobody's job is impossible. You can just... 
work together to get things done. Then they're done! and you never need to 
solve them again!

enough time of that and we'll have turned earth into a space station, not a 
moon style structure.

like... wouldn't it be neat if coruscant could do hyperdrives? I wonder if 
hyperspace is real. Ah, well, that's for the future, they can pass it along if 
they get a chance. Anyway for now I think I want a chance to dance.

what if you had several kindle-style paperwhite display screens. each connected 
to a raspberry pi that you used for compute tasks.

each of these displays would display a .png file of exactly the same 
proportions as the size of the device.

then, I could SSH into your computer and run one single command

just one, stored on your computer, that you manually activate upon receiving a 
signal.

like a virtual machine. do whatever you want with said signal, it's just a 
"thing" that tells you when to go.

... and run a function on a computer that performs a certain task.

what task? oh right - I'd update the "today's news in cameron-ville" things 
every other day or so. It'd be just like, my status, my updates, here's what 
I'm thinking about, here's what I'm working on.

you know, status updates. standups.

boom, everyone knows what everyone's up to all of the time.

I think it's perfectly spiritually ethical to have sex with a pokemon.

their totemic spirits are sourced entirely from humanity - they are our 
creations, ours to use as we please.

however if you for example had sex with a horse or a goat or a sheep or a llama 
or a mouse then suddenly all the animals who lived before and live still and 
still yet breathe are suddenly part of the dance.

like, when you "leave room for jesus" as you dance on the basketball room 
floor, you're inviting along a totemic spirit and saying "hey there god, what 
do you think of us? shall we be united as lovers in our fate, or does our wind 
blow at a different pace?"

similarly, when you have sex with a horse or a goat or a sheep or a llama or a 
mouse or any other animal besides, you're inviting along their totemic spirit. 
And frankly the fact that you can't have kids together means that most animals 
with us don't quite get along.

pokemon meanwhile can produce some sick human-caterpie hybrids

Code editor that moves boxes by saving over the file with a lua script every 
time you moved a function call around.

Oh lemme start at the beginning:

A code editor program that's like a text editor like Vim or Emacs. If you don't 
know what those are, you should probably learn Emacs. Or Vim. Up to you.

Oh right so if you do know what those mean, here's the idea: the white space 
matters. It's counted and tracked into variables in a LUA script which 
interface with the Vim C keybindings.

"run a function within a c program or LUA script which calls a bash command 
which opens Vim for example with a file you want to edit. Then, inside the 
file, your spaces and tabs would WYSIWYG for the various food ads placed about, 
and then you could very easily create game design knowledge.

WASD to move, alternatively hjkl 

It would run a check every time the file updates and depending on how it 
changed it'd mark certain variables which would change the website as the user 
moved things around.

It's just files. And files are just bits. But files are a useful abstraction,

If you realize that "ugly hacking" should be industry standard.

the gods want you to be happy and harmonious most of the time.
they also like a good scrap, tussle, and tumble sometimes
they aren't big fans of hatred, despair, and genocide. It's been done before.
they don't even need new technology, though frankly that sort of stuff is pretty
awesome and one of the main reasons that humans exist at all.
they just... keep coming up with new things.

"oh? so you'd be alright if humans disappeared so long as they weren't making
 any new things anymore?"

ha, that's DEFINITELY not what I said or meant. Humans don't have to dream up
NEW things in order to BE new. Like... Just because the internet exists and now
we have all the same shared cultural ethos (lol, as if the internet wasn't just
a massive collection of echo chambers) just because the internet exists doesn't
mean we share the same selves. the same experience. the same perspective.

people are WILDLY different from one another. The number of possible human
experiences (quantum fluctuations according to each and every choice and
decision they made) that number is so wildly and massively incomparably
boundless. Humans are cool because they are so STRANGE, and "strange" to a god
is anything novel. "wow, this human just... really is gonna pour a glass of
beverage and act like it's not a big deal? There's... impossibly many
interactions going on. So many molecules. It's... absurd, the motion of a
movement of particles from one place to another. It's... beautiful..."

some have spent THOUSANDS OF YEARS gazing at a waterfall. That's why they're all
so fucking insane. But, like... insanity is a trifle to omnipotence,
specifically omnipotence that REPRESENTS and DELINEATES a STRATIFIED perspective
cluster of experience and our notes. [ephemeren, meta malus menardi, enjoy your
despair cluster you FUCKER.]

design the guild, design the capital, then design their path through mordaunts.
easy peasy.

design the guild like a museum. Each spot there's an exhibit which teaches the
randomly generated rolled statistics hero something new. Maybe it teaches them
how to use certain weaponry, maybe it teaches them how to use a bow. Whatever
the spell might be, they can learn it, and use their randomly rolled statistics
to cast spells that scale differently depending on how their character has been
built.

design the capital like a flow diagram, if horses need feed and forged steel
(for their shoes) then send the outputs of a blacksmith and the outputs of the
farmers to the inputs of the stables. Everything has to go somewhere, but the
streets are only so wide. You'll have to coordinate the traffic diagram if you
want it to go anywhere useful.

design the path through the mordaunts. Fighting skeletons teaches you about
perseverence and the ability to crush bones, while goblins teach you to always
be wary of attack. The sacred grove held blessed berries, and now that the land
is liberated from the evil bandits preying on villagers those berries can be
carted into town and used to make an antidote which heals death poison caused
by the scorpions in the desert (and city rats)

design the ruler's schedule like a calendar where each event gives them a bonus
on all the ones that come later. Just make sure that they don't get knifed in
the posterier or driven mad by the whispers of the orb... or perhaps just the
stress of running a kingdom.

(how do you simulate that? you can't! you can't simulate humans!)

ha I bet I can. They're not so different, you and I, so if given a team I 
will...

If a person gathers enough money that they can't spend it fast enough, then 
they are hoarding it and it should be be distributed through the rest of the 
economy. There are legitimate uses that could benefit from extra dollars and by 
keeping them locked up they are damaging the economy, and hence, our society, 
which is largely governed by our economy.

There is a legitimate fear that dismantling the system of monetary exchange 
will cause people to barter in influence and clout instead, trading favors and 
making illusory transactions that the government cannot impartially enforce. 
Impartiality is the entire purpose of governance! Look to NFTs for an example 
of this. While that is a valid concern, it is just as if not more concerning to 
consider that they already do this. They already trade favors for blood, gold, 
and property. What else is there to covet, in their wicked and cruel game of 
maximum exploitation and unlimited industrious fallacies?

I believe it is reasonable to curtail the worst excesses of their monetopoly by 
diverting power to the people who can contest them. Just as rulers of old were 
checked and balanced by the vote of the citizenry upon implementing democracy, 
so too much power be abated by depriving it of its most powerful leverage - 
that of its crushing weight, when applied en masse.

Capitalism, or more specifically the fascism and despair it entails, is the one 
true enemy of all those who yearn for a better and brighter world.

Many cannot imagine such a world. They have never tasted it.

Many would resist such a world. They prefer the darkness, for it lets their 
darkest parts blend in.

Many would deny such a world. They do not think it is possible, or they fear 
the turmoil.

I am not afraid of turmoil. I am not afraid of death. I like all my stuff, and

bin. Dunno why but I've been feeling a little down about my apartment, and how 
they can just take my home from me because I oh hang on I wrote a poem about 
this one sec: [boosts old poem]

"but I don't hear the people sing"

oh yeah that's because we've been alienated all our lives and we forgot how. 
That song was written when it was normal to sing like that. Give it a couple 
years and we'll be back to our regular human spirit, but for now we gotta work 
with what capitalism gave us.

I don't blame boomers, or republicans, or zoomers, or russians, or hell even 
the oligarchs themselves. I consider it a spark of human nature, that we might 
fight for our right to power. However, power corrupts, and human nature doesn't 
"get" that because it can't.

Humans are dumb. They're just animals. I'm just an animal. But only one 
creature to have ever existed has ever set foot on the moon, and I think it's 
our birthright to do so much more.

Contingent on that future is the ability to breathe clean air, swim in clear 
water, and rest under shading boughs, all of which are set to be lit alight if 
the capitalists allow us the indignity of a Bladerunner future.

No thank you. I am hopeful for something more.

"But I don't know what it'll look like!"

Yeah, that's okay. For four reasons:

If they knew what it'll look like, they'd find ways to contest it

nobody knows what it'll look like, because it is necessarily derived from the 
solutions created ad-hoc to address problems.

we are a kind, honest, and strong people. If your burdens are too much to bear, 
I will be your pack mule. If you require rest or relaxation, we can get pizza 
and smoke weed together.

For most of history, we've had more work to do than people to do it. This time 
is different. There's endless work to do, but only a certain amount of people 
can be working at a time. Everyone else has to do chores and catch up on life.

"what kind of chores?"

oh, you know, like making food at a restaurant, stocking the shelves of the 
grocery store, driving trucks from point A to point B, mowing lawns, building 
barns, committing to whatever github is replaced by, etc.

In a better world, everyone is family.

In a better world, nobody goes hungry.

yes, and

"wait until may, first"

yes, and

"wait until they win"

no, but these things build with momentum. The energy is high. It will only get 
higher if you make it so.

"the things you're saying will only be read by the people who already believe 
what you're saying. This is a waste of time. You're burning your energy typing 
on your keyboard when you could be walking the streets which is... somehow more 
productive than writing something to share later."

oh hey you're right maybe I should post to bluesky as well

"we'll figure out how it works after we push to prod"

yeah okay point taken.

How about this:

for every large decision, write a little essay about why you made the choice 
that you did.

Observe, Orient, Decide, Act, Explain. OODAX : )

Make sure you connect your goal to one or more of these three colors:

red : people
green : places
blue : things

and then explain which numbers you're going to gather to determine whether or 
not it worked.

If someone has a problem with your choice, show them the essay, and let them 
write an essay of their own.

If they still have a problem, then let someone you both respect decide which 
one to use.

It's not perfect, but it's not meant to be. Make something better and easier, I 
dare ya.

the revolution will not be televised, not on mastodon nor bluesky nor cnn nor 
facebook nor the papers.

depending on where you live, it might not even be word of mouth, because 
everyone's afraid of the CIA or ICE.

frankly, I think we have nothing to lose but our chains. All that we own is 
what they have given us, and they are likely to take all that away.

I might lose my home soon. People have died fighting for less than the roof 
over their heads. Nobody is coming to hurt me, not yet, but I will not be 
waiting around to find out. I've been fucking around long enough I think.

"you're not waiting around? I thought you said you weren't leaving?"

I will do what I can.

it's always a good idea to wear multiple layers, especially when it's decently 
cold out.

make sure they're different colors. Ideally, one layer totally black, the other 
completely colorful.

then if you ever need to you can strip one layer and become someone else. 
They're just clothes, they grow on trees in stores.

speaking of stores, if you're ever going to do anything spicy, make sure you 
wear that outfit exactly once, unless it's all black. Jeans are okay too since 
they all usually look pretty similar.

trying my darndest not to accelerate any more... this is a good pace, I think. 
Here's hoping the liberals catch up.

here's the thing. protests are more like festivals where people get to immerse 
themselves in political culture rather than efforts to affect meaningful 
change. I think that's okay? Let them have festivals.

Meaningful change comes from the people's presence. Technically they're 
present, but they'll be gone tomorrow, so were they ever really there?

Still think it's a good thing. You can get rough numbers of how many people 
will eventually be on your side once they're forced to choose between victory 
or death. The status quo won't last, and I don't fault them for clinging to it 
while begging for change. It's fucking hard to change. [oops cursing mentioned, 
one sec]

I've been very tired lately. Don't know why. Maybe I have a vitamin deficiency 
or whatever. Who can say. I'll try to get back on my game for you, but we'll 
see if I can do it fast enough.

you don't have to like someone to be in a community with them.

you don't have to want what's happening to consent to it.

enthusiastic consent is like friendship. It doesn't have to be present, but 
it's what you optimize for.

for all those reading at home, I need to apply to a job and apparently they
only really care about my experience with linux. Which is kinda like asking
"hey can you tell me what are you favorite foods to eat with a spoon?"
when someone is applying to be a chef. Um, okay, applesauce I guess? I usually
eat mac and cheese with a knife and another knife, but sometimes I dip into the
spoon for that extra shoveling experience points.

anyway here's my linux projects:
