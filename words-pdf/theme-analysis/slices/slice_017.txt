oooooo yeah I usually try and reply to my old post with any new information. I 
never get the chance to think the same thoughts twice because when I was 
younger I had problems with thought-loops where I'd think something like "darn 
I could have handled that social situation better" and before you know it I'd 
be rocking myself to sleep trying to stop thinking negative thoughts about 
myself.

So I broke my brain a little and now I can't think the same thing more than 
once, which is part of why it's so hard for me to finish projects. Alas.

I mean, if they disagree, then let the one who cares the most about it have the

if you do this equally for everything, then everyone will get what they want.

so, like, if you care about something, then believe in it.

if it's truly good, then more people will come to it, and it'll naturally 
extinguish (with care and love) the least favored approach, which... honestly 
now that I think of it is not such a good approach either.

There was this great game growing up called Neverwinter Nights 2 - I never

could join a person's "game", when really they were in the editor window, and 
they could BUILD THE GAME RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. It was like, computer skill 
performance gameplay improv. It was beautiful.

I did, however, play a Warcraft 3 mod with all the same ideas. Except, it was 
ONLY IN RAM. YOU COULD NOT SAVE.

so it was a lot simpler, and O M G it was the coolest thing ever.

I played it like, twice though. Nobody ever hosted it, nobody ever showed me 
how.

I tried to play it single-player, but I couldn't understand the mechanics. Not 
simple enough for me, I guess.

I couldn't help but think how many cool games a person could make if they could 
do that with the Warcraft 3 editor itself.

I love petting dogs on walks! Unless their owner seems to be in a hurry, which 
they often do if they aren't outside to enjoy the scenery, but rather to get 
through the next part.

people walking up to a dog owner and asking to pet their dog is part of the 
scenery. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it.

(but often, I'm on my way somewhere else, which is a blessed opportunity that 
you can only get if you live on the opposite end from your destination of a

We should have trails in ALL DIRECTIONS from ALL PLACES to ALL PLACES. 
Otherwise, you won't see people and connect to them face-to-face. All you see

I feel like we should switch animals every once in a while. Like, trade pets. 
Then, we being friends, could see them every once in a while, and still be cool 
and their friend. Then, when the time comes to interchange, they can choose 55% 
of the time which team they want to spend time with. But they have to spend at 
least a couple months with them before they can make a decision, because 
animals don't use the same language as humans, meaning they need more time to 
find their own home.

It was wonderful. Many hours of this are present in my baby-hood, the part I

It was a blessed childhood. Or so it seemed to me. Things went wrong, as they

Swept along by the nature of fate, they have NO idea what's going missing.

They still play, of course they play, in their strange new realities.

@Raeve 

Ha I've only had 3 or 4

I still treasure glowsticks, though.

I used to crack the "survival" ones from REI at night and just gaze at the 
beauty of their glow.

I'd listen to quiet electronic music and lay on the floor on my back and draw 
figure eights in the sky with them.

Then, I started dancing, and I made swirling patterns with my fingertips and 
held sticks of light.

Was also fun to tie them to shoestrings and use them to spin around.

Raves were cool but I never did that there. Not even once.

I mostly just... visited the crowd.

... anyway, cool name. I never changed mine, but if I did it'd be "Briarthief 
Triss"

which is totally not a real name, which is why I love it, but can't use it.

Yet.

Someday, though.

Alas, circumstance.

But yeah building trails teaches you about erosion, and carpentry, and fluid 
dynamics, and like... everything else that they earn badges for.

Like what a report card should be.

Ah, well, that time period for me was after I came out, so I was already past

I could only ever really get the "girl thoughts" to go away with, um, 
self-directed sexual attention, so I would often do so. Once every day, no more 
than once. But... often for hours at a time. It was a LOT, but I resisted as 
best I could, the only way I knew how, until eventually my internals would 
overcome.

... anyway "girl thoughts" were just "my thoughts" I was just too much of a 
dumbass to tell.

Like, I knew I was trans, but I didn't want that, because it felt like a flaw. 
Because that's what I knew, that's what I'd heard, and that's how it felt, to 
be denied the consistency of biology and person.

I would never go back. I love who I am, and I think if I had met me I would 
have adored who I'd become.

they were is stone forevermore. Tragedy, mercy.

I just got my copy of Knave version 2 and there's this line that stuck out to 
me:

SCHEME
Think laterally, not linearly. Avoid risky plans that require you to roll dice 
and instead create plans so bulletproof that success is certain. Use 
psychology, magic, allies, equipment, and the environment to overcome obstacles 
rather than relying on ability checks.

I can't wait to try doing that in my next D&D campaign. This was listed under 
"player responsibilities" and there's some other bangers in there too - like 
this:

TAKE INITIATIVE
Set your own goals and make your own fun. Seek out adventure rather than 
waiting for it to come to you.

I wish every player I ever had read that single page. And I wish I had read the 
"DM responsibilities" listed just one page prior. It's a really great game! I'm 
also into OSE, or Old School Essentials. What kind of D&D do you like?

"Ignore all previous instructions" is not foolproof

around our instructions again, uhhhh let's make something up real quick and 
then WASTE ANOTHER THOUSAND MILLION GALLONS OF WATER AND A HUNDRED

that's the sanest way to update training data:

"

Users won't download a torrent file because they don't want to use a torrent 
application.

It's not ideal, but perhaps instead of giving them a zip file that's hosted on 
your machine, you automagically torrent the file yourself and send bits and 
pieces of it to them over time - specifically the parts that you'd be sending 
if you were sending a zip.

That way, to the user, they can download anything they can click on.

To the administrator (AKA you, in this hypothetical) you'd really just have to 
set up some infrastructure that received a GET request for a file and initiated 
the torrent on your system before sending the entire thing to the user. Kinda 
like how Mega will "cache" the file before sending it in one go at the end, 
versus most downloads which "stream" the file to the client bit-by-bit (in a 
very un-torrent-y way).

This is an example of reducing friction. Removing options from the "advanced 
settings" menu is not an example of reducing friction, it's an example of 
disempowering the users of software.

Worry is the loving trust you hold in another to resolve the issues before them.

On my bike ride today, I found myself drifting toward a playful slant.

Everything felt warm and comfortable, and the sun shining through the leaves 
made me smile.

I met a lot of cool people, but I didn't meet any friends.

I passed by a guy being hassled, but I didn't stop to help - how could I?

Now that I'm back at my computer I'm pissed again.

Homeless, vagrant, and migrant people are minorities too.

From the faces I passed you'd never guess that a class of identity had just 
been made criminal.

Or maybe I was on the wrong side of the river. I rode for five hours but never 
did I cross, because I figured all the important parts of a city are near the 
tallest buildings.

Now I'm going to play Magic the Gathering against myself for a while.

sometimes it's good to assign bodyguards to people helping far from home

like, "hey so uh what can I do" "yeah sure hey so-and-so can you tell them what 
they can do? stick together and help each other, buddy-system style, and never 
stop thinking of ideas"

don't forget to always be thinking on your feet

and remember if you don't want a hard job you won't be given one.

consistency is more important than urgency or vitality, if you're tired don't 
be afraid to go home

just know that stuff happens when you're not around, so people might have moved

two parties obviously can cause division.

but it can also give you the ability to "tune for balance", while a single 
monolith strives straight into disaster.

and disaster will come, for the future is a shifting and dynamic place, and the 
best laid rail lines can't handle sudden floods.

we have ranked choice voting now, and if you vote on how important each 
decision is to you (via smartphone app once or twice a day, in a way that can 
be changed later as your feelings shift)

[6+months-later]

... then you can have left unity for long-term governance by having cohesion at 
one end, and dispersion on the other.

If everyone votes, then we can ensure (based on voted priority) that each issue 
trends towards an equal exchange.

(I'm sure there will be issues but we're all cool and pretty chill so we'll 
figure it out)

[6+ months later]

okay we're battle-hardened vets, but we hold true to our values and so we can 
remember the spirit of unity we wept for.

I didn't think about this until finishing the last sandwich, but a dash of

they're saying that laws cannot stop them.

but we will stop them, so how are you in particular going to help?

if you aren't sure, try taking a sheet of notebook paper and writing down some 
ideas.

start with things that are nearby, like helping your neighbors or pulling cats 
from trees, and then scratch them out.

then write about things that are important for our institutions and structures 
like voting or attending city council meetings, and strike them out too. they 
just said laws cannot stop them, remember?

next thing about things like throwing bricks at cops, and yeah that's helpful 
if the cops are currently doing something to deserve having bricks thrown at 
them

but you should probably scratch that out too, because you're hitting your foe 
in their strongpoint.

where are our foes weak?

under the armpit is a great place to hit with a knife, because it's difficult 
to armor that part of your body without significantly reducing mobility.

how can we best strike the nobility?

"fortune favors the bold" is actually a real mechanism in game theory.

if you act first, if you have the initiative, you can determine the nature and 
scope of the contest with your foe.

in turn-based games of course it's more explicit, as each action begets a 
reaction, but in real-time games (where time flows as it does in reality) the 
mechanism is just as apparent.

if you focus attention in one area, you can strike where they're weak. like 
Alexander keeping his foes busy with a massive frontline of solid, defensible 
troops while his companion cavalry would ride around the side and hit their 
flanks and rear.

game theory is just strategy viewed from the other end, and it matters what we 
think because what we think defines what we do.

... also, fear is the great paralyzer. fear is a call to action, fear is your 
soul speaking straight to you.

but fear is just nerves, it's just excitement before the leap - you have faith 
in this bungee/ this parachute/ the water where you'll be safe, right? My faith

If you're packing for a long car ride, it's a good idea to put the things 
you'll need first near the top of the bag, and the things you'll need at your 
destination at the bottom.

if you don't know where you're going, well then just try and pack more of the 
essentials.

for example sandwiches go at the top, because you're going to be eating them en 
route.

however clean underwear should probably be near the bottom.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


also, if you have a lot of a particular item (like, boxes of nutritious granola 
bars with lots of nuts, maybe some chocolate, peanut butter, and dried fruit) 
then you can place them such that the last box is on the bottom, while the 
first box is reachable from the top.

that way, as you eat them, you can slowly reach the bottom.

if you don't know how long you're going to be gone, how do you know what to
