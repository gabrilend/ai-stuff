AI engineers only ask users for prompts because they don't have any ideas of 
their own

i'm a programmer, I think of AI like a tool, like a for loop or something. it's 
trivial to script together a local LLM that can process your stuff 1s slower 
every time you click the mouse, but like... who cares, right? everybody needs a 
chatbot...

then they plan to script together a computer system that operates just like a 
corporation and it's like... no way, now there's something that can compete.

and they don't know how to implement it. (but they're working on it)

like, think about the absolute most automated Microsoft Teams or Discord could 
be.

there's SO MUCH of your text-based information that they could process ANYTHING.

well, anything that's been performed before.

there'll still be a need for people, who actually apply the things they've 
learned. and -- stack overflow --

okay, but... well, you'll figure it out.

you can grow anything in soil.

that's the neat thing about it - it's nature's recycler

problem is... if you bury like, plastic and shit, then all that's gonna grow up 
into your plants is... plastic and shit.

the structural growth mechanisms of plants are inhibited by pollution, that's 
the entire issue with them. animals can adapt - like, whatever, right?

but if everything's biodegradable, then suddenly the whole world is a 
trash-dump.

(that's how they think)

if you want to optimize food growth, you can supply with specific types of 
growing fuel. like native americans who had like supplies of many different 
types of manure.

a cow eating grass will have different nutrients in it's poop than a duck 
eating carrots. duh.

so, if you combine different outputs to make new, better results...

you can pretty much bio-engineer anything you'd like.

like... feed the corn so that it's kernels are huge, right? then make that one 
marry the other, and boom it's more likely grow.

those billionaires are using their money as a weapon to "vote" toward what

they often aren't very efficient because they're only looking at what sells.

human interest is not the only factor to optimize for, and yet that's the only 
one they're incentivized to.

decreasing the resolution of a screen can help with visual impairments.

for example, when I take my glasses off I need to reduce the resolution to a 
minimum of 1280x720 in order to be able to read the text on my terminal. Even 
then I have to squint or move my face within a foot or so of the screen.

how low do you need to set the resolution on your screen to see?

if you're on linux you can use the xrandr command to try it out temporarily 
until your next boot. To do so, type:

xrandr --query

to list all your supported video modes. Look for the "DP-1" or "HDMI-1" or 
whatever label. Mine is DP-4.

then, to set the resolution temporarily, do:

xrandr --output DP-4 --mode 1280x720

or whatever values you want

@nus@mstdn.social 

display scaling accomplishes a similar goal through a different mechanism. You 
might find that the visuals are sharper, however you will need to configure 
every program to use this functionality (if it's present, which it's not in 
most programs) - for OS level things this is usually a good option.

Changing the resolution will change the size of ALL visuals on your computer, 
but they might be fuzzier (but if you're blind as a bat, why would you care 
about fuzziness? It's all fuzzy!)

increasing the font size can also make it easier to read, which both of these 
options are doing in a sorta round-about way.

if tech CEOs wanted to solve REAL problems they'd think about things like how

For example, picture a fleet of delivery drones that let you swap nail polish 
with people nearby for basically zero-dollars per month.

that's just one example, but that class of problem is the problems that affect 
a certain class of people that tech CEOs fundamentally do not care about - and 
yes I'm referring to people who paint their nail polish themselves. AKA women, 
and poor people who can't afford going to a salon every week.

problem is....... for every solution like this you design, well suddenly you 
have a lot more applications for it than the consumer needs or wants. like for
