the increased tech salaries granted to Europeans and Americans reflects only 
the increased opportunities for experience and the ability to culturally be 
immersed in an industry that is developing.

functionally, not saying it's intentional, but the function of such salaries 
are to deny technical expertise to poor countries and prevent them from 
developing software.

good luck learning from scratch. they'll drop you in with java and web 
frameworks if you're lucky. that's hardly a way to learn.

I learned on visual basic, then Warcraft III mod scripting, then C, then BASH, 
then HTML, then Lua. Good luck recreating that pipeline in a disconnected 
culture and industry.

kinda makes me think they should try organizing on a massive scale and 
re-implement everything from assembly.

I mean the C compiler is pretty cool. Probably has the most man-hours in terms 
of development time. what if we had more men

seconds. If it's wrong, I ask again, and I spend a minute or two debugging. 
Sometimes that's better than telling google exactly what you're working on.

in DWM, that's "alt+enter" and then I type the name of the LLM script I wrote 
"prompt:" and then type whatever question I have and it spits out the results. 
Then when I'm done, either "prompt:" again, which saves the context in an 
environment variable (okay actually a file that I made and I pull from, but 
functionally it's like an environment variable because its just a flat file 
string) until I close the terminal. Then it deletes the context and I can start 
anew, or if I wanted to have multiple conversations going I can do that too.

... then I get syntax related search results from locally running software.

"capitalism brings real value into the world" says my father, in my words, the

"oh the people are having too much fun, let's recede back to a more plaintive 
state"

when we raised cattle on the farm I grew up on, we produced enough meat to feed 
our friends and family. That was enough. That was more than enough. They gave 
us whatever they made, and it worked out. Everyone could specialize, and 
everyone got fed, with plenty to spare.

then, wanderlust tempted him, and we lost what we had. I'm not bitter - I know

capitalism, fundamentally, is not about making products or profits.

I'll give you a hint.

I could be one of the greatest programmers in the world, but I just can't seem 
to find any professional experience, though I ask for it quite often.

why is that?

does the systems of control and 'pression allow me to contribute to building 
products or profits? No, neither products nor profits are contributed to, which 
contributes to the fact that I have little professional experience building 
products and profits.

yet I am quite talented in a variety of disciplines, including but not limited 
to computer programming.

maybe I just optimized for skills that would be useful outside of the workplace 
environment instead of optimizing for skills that would be useful inside of the 
workplace environment.

or maybe the entire system is designed not to create products and profits, but 
rather to develop systems of control, hierarchy, & most importantly structure 
for all the vagabond apes looking for meals.

if we didn't have society, we'd quickly devolve into beasts of burden and 
nobody really wants that, do we? much more fun to let the cow-puters handle 
that. we humans can use our creativity and intellect just like all the other 
animals who we've liberated from our own chains. Would you want your daughters 
shoveling shit or writing poetry?

I personally think shoveling shit is less dangerous, but something something 
what-do-i-know something something who-can-say.

It is usually better to spend points of dollars rather than goodwill.

Save goodwill for when they have so much of it they are looking for someone to 
give it away from.

When in distress, ask for dollars to be used on your behalf. When in 
celebration, ask for goodwill to be used on your behalf.

I'm still trying to save capitalism, individualism, and our way of life from 
its own jaws as it eats it's own tale. Part of that means pulling the tail 
right back out, and another part is pulling the teeth back. Gotta do both.

What if landlords acted like banks instead of subscription services?

"sure I'll hold onto your money and invest it wisely and sparingly, according 
to the direction of the collectively desired expression of all of the tenants 
and their expressions during the expressing hour, which is every Tuesday at 
noon when we all get together (everyone who wants to come) and talk about what 
projects we want to fund and which ones would be best for the community. If 
there's any prophets giving profit on any of your stocks or saving bonds that 
we hold in your honor dear tenant then it will be reinvested into the same 
projects you told us to care about. If you start being a dick though and we 
want you gone, we can short-sell all your options and say "hey find a new part 
of town" that way you have a bit of a dowry to offer the housing payment people 
when you show up with your tail between your legs. What's that? You don't get 
how this would bring income to the property, whatever that means, and you worry 
that it wouldn't be implemented because what does it even do? Well my dear 
citizen i will explain it to you. When the post-office holds your funds for you 
and invests according to your general and vague directions, it builds up wealth 
in the local economy. They can use those dollars for productive ends like 
replacing the windows or the gutters or clearing the snow paths in the 
springfallautumn. This will be drawn from the collective pool and everyone is 
affected equitably. How much income do you make? Okay that determines your rent 
percentage. High income means you pay for the local ecology more, and low means 
that you need more time to build up wealth, which will enable it to benefit 
those around the place more readily."

Blizzard should make more than one animation style for swinging your weapon - 
as you level up, the style "tweens" between however many combat palettes you 
made.

So, like, maybe they swing their sword +/-15 degrees each time to simulate the 
pseudo random nature of combat.

Or maybe they start occasionally stepping into a maneuver 

Which the player doesn't consciously control.

Instinct, if you will. The body reacting to its [sensory organs, but pronounced 
"surveyor"]

Anyway i think by adjusting the monster characters in WoW should wander around 
and gather within sight of a player. Seeking you out, waiting for a critical 
threshold of their peers. Then, when you allowed or slowed down to examine a 
bit of "this-or-here", (quests) they would gang up on you and ambush! Bwaha 
just watch out for the mob 

(kinda like that scene in the second book of The Book of Malazan series where 
they're wandering through a desert storm and meeting all sorts of strange sorts 
of people)

Anyway in seeking to improve the player's view-time, i decided it would feel 
the most impactful to do the design related things related to things like 
making the gameplay the most visceral.

"just design your cities radially around a bus-stop. boom, transportation 
infrastructure solved"

such confidence. such a lack of... geography. what about cities built on the 
coast?

"idk, just have a half-circle or something for the part that's under-water. 
Leave some gaps for wildlife and such to make it to the water and then build a 
biiiiiiiig stone wall between our access point and theirs. Boom, free 
regionally personalized safaris for every state with a watering hole."

okay but what about the parts that are already there?

"oh like the buildings and such? well, people can still live in them but to 
build anything NEW, you need to obey the demands of the blueprint exactly. So 
if your specific build-plot intersected with one or more plots that had 
buildings on them that are currently inhabited by their rightful owners who are 
there under their own will and not duressed or compelled to leave or stay in 
any way?"

... yeah, like the. buildings. Right. so grid-based vs radial (with room 
between 4 animals)

gonna stop selling anything that I write. Any previous contracts are null and 
void, please only do with my work what I want you to do with my work. Which 
frankly is to show it to as many people as you think would be interested in it 
to see.

I never sold a single copy, I just... put it up for sale. Nobody saw it! The 
webpage has never even been opened. Alas. just means I gotta relinquish the 
potential for capital gains from the labor I use to generate that which I 
produce. Ho hum fiddle-de-dee or whatever.
