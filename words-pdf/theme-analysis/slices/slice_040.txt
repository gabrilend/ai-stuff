The yard right now, as it is, is the most beautiful lawn I've ever had. But i 
lay no claim to it, it's not mine or my own. Still, i love it, so i advocate 
for it when i can.

It feels wrong that you so ardently argue for its destruction when you haven't 
taken any time to get to know it. You hide from it and refuse to trust that its 
possible to enjoy it. Do you ever just sit around in it? The summer is perfect 
weather for shade gazing.

Also,

The fact that you've weaponized your emotions against me to get what you want 
kinda hurts because i have made no attempt to claim it as my property that i 
control and wield. It feels like manipulation. Like you wanted to fight me, 
wanted to hurt me, and the yard is just how it gets done.

Every time we have ever talked about it, I've argued my point friendly and 
tried to problem solve. All I've received is spite and shutdown in return, and 
i am perplexed as to how i could be better.

It feels like you don't respect me, or treat me as an equal, and that any 
concerns i have are just creating drama.

But my feelings are constantly hurt, when all I've done is try to be kind to 
you.

I wonder if it's because you're paying to be here, both with labor and dollars, 
and i am housed without a home?

I love it here. I am loved here. Why could it not be home?

I want to show you all that yards can be, especially since we have two of them 
and can use them for different purposes.

I closed the blinds in my room so that you can hang out back there without 
worrying about being seen. I'd only notice if i walked out the screen door. 
Again, problem solving.

my enemy is not "the rich"

money brings power, and power brings evil, but there are many other ways to 
gather power that may be just as evil.

my enemy is evil. of which there is very little in the world, but much of which 
resides in the hands of the powerful, upon whom all our fates depend.

most people with money are either stupid lucky, willful, or intensely focused.

some people with power are rich, and some people with power are evil.

I know it when I see it. Sometimes, you need to force the choice - test their 
virtue - and from this you are informed.

most things go WAY over my head.

most things are too easy to be true.

most things that Id do for you tend to be of the heart. I'm not a frontline 
girl, I have weak noodle arms, but I do hope you're in shape.

resolve, determination, and innovation. That is what I offer. Do you want it? 
I'm sure. I won't prove it with blood, not unless I may raise my fists in 
defence of another.

I'm not JUST a baby, I'm a banner too.

in defence of who? of me, of you?

sure. all of the above.

"bad guys are on the horizon, they're marching to the gates, and you sit and 
you plead with your god to deliver you from the fate you forsaw, and delivered 
too. what is your response?"

I wish I knew. I deal with what's in front of me. would that my dreams could be 
true. every time I've tried that route, it's never been the right time. I guess 
I have terrible timing.

Time me for me, please?

I swear I'll sprint the fastest, as hard as my legs will carry me.

I swear I'll work the hardest, at least until I burn out from lack of sleep.

I swear I'll be at my finest, when all the keeps crack around us and all of us 
hear as it's falling around us.

there's something of an urgency to start-ology, but when you don't talk about 
it because you're italian silenced, how can you ever know when the wind blows

counting from 0 is an abstraction applied upon computer programming by people 
who don't want you to process lists.

whose idea was it to make the first entry the zero-ith entry?

for loops should be "how many units from the first entry" instead of indexes. 
that way you can write with 0 as the first number for for loops, and nothing 
else.

I hate winning and I don't like losing. The playing is where the game is.

[games of life and death are no fun]

hence, why nobody invites me, because I try for the middle approach that 
respects both people. this tends to make people mad because its like "bro 
they're nazis" and I'm like "okay but how do you know" and they're like "fuck 
you" so I'm like "fuck nazis? actually?" and they're like "you're with them" 
and I'm like "I'm with you" and they're like "stop infiltrating" and I'm like 
"who's infiltrated?" and they say "stop talking to the internet" and I say 
"nobody reads me anyway" and they say "screensho0ts are forever" and I'm like 
"I'm pretty as can be"

this, combined with a strong sense of justice, implies the narratives I 
instinctually provide.

wei wu wei according to Ursula K. Le Guin, this means "doing without doing", or 
"show, don't tell" but minus the doing, and adding the "tell"ing.

everyone hate you? hardly. they just want you gone.

all they have to do is hate you and work against you and never tell you and act 
as if you're fine but secretly behind your back plot against you and then it's 
EASY to dethrone you.

suited to it.

fight me. contest me. say it to my face.

I don't respect any opinion otherwise of me.

royalty is not not royalty just because they're ineligible. democracy is better 
for picking rulers! how many do you have in your mind?

[I thought you were an anarchist]

I am. the presence of rulers does not necessarily violate the implicit 
sovereignce of consent, and it's necessary presence for rulership.

"no gods no kings no masters" means an end to coercive work.

coercion is unethical because it violates consent. This is implicit in the 
definition of coercion.

violating consent for those who give you power is a lesson I learned very 
young, when I made a mistake and harmed my brother's mother's sisters's son's 
daughter.

there is evil inside all of us. It is always a lever we could pull. But 
fundamentally, we don't. Why is this? Because kindness works better. It 
sincerely does. But darkness is something to stumble into, before you've

something that is avoidable. Otherwise, it'd be inevitable, and its not. Never

despair, the dichotomy with hope. Upon it all our struggles are brought to

if your game takes too long to load, longer than like... 5 seconds, then it's 
got to work on asset-pipelining. Sometimes, even graphical design. But mostly 
it's resolving technical debt. Why is it debt? because it makes it run slower, 
not less correct. Meaning it's something you don't have to deal with until you 
have to deal with it. Later on down the road. BUT if you reach the end of the 
road (product launch) and you're still carrying debt... you're gonna go under, 
it's just a question of when. Why would you not sponsor innovation? An

The critical conflict in Solarpunk is between people building and protecting 
the infrastructure necessary to survive global warming, and the people who need 
to take and plunder in order to survive. Both sides use riot cops. Both sides 
use plucky rag tag bands of protagonists. Both sides and evil, and both sides 
are good. Motivations matter, and in the end we are made whole through our 
continuous conflict. 
[30m

Capitalist solar punk wants you to abandon conflict because it's much easier 
when everyone puts their head down and does their (admittedly much better) job. 
But I refuse to relinquish the primal human spirit, the tenacity and the 
passion that has driven us this far. There's only so much distance you can gain 
by fighting a wall, fighting space, fighting stamina, or anything else that 
does not fight back. Conflict between cooperative equal partners is the most 
productive form of learning, and deviations from that reduce it's efficacy but 
conflict in all forms tends to be more efficient than just trying your best.

Notice I said efficient, not ethical. That side of humanity must also be 
assured in tandem with efficiency.

part of the reason the classical socialist countries had difficulties with 
bureaucracy is because they centralized both execution *and* operation. I 
believe it'd be much better to centralize just execution, while leaving 
operation to the distributed masses who can generally figure their own jobs 
out. Of course, they'd need to be led, but that's the job of on-site organizers 
who can get people together to accomplish a goal. Different jobs - not better, 
not worse, just different. 
[30m
[45m
And while we're at it, the generation of laws should be distributed, while the 
execution of them should be centralized. Meaning, there should be one state who 
operates on the rules and regulations created by the masses. This state wields 
only the power explicitly given to it by those who it serves, specifically the 
people. These rules are based on ethical understandings generated by 
crowd-sourced and abstracted scenarios that are pitched to people randomly. 
they are then asked to judge, using their own personal morality, the result of 
how things should be. By considering all of these responses, trends may be 
extracted and analyzed - for example, let's say that culturally people in, I 
dunno, Georgia believe something different about punishment for, say, stealing 
a loaf of bread when compared to people in Spokane Washington. They should not 
be forced to obey the cultural maxims of people who live so far away. The laws 
should be executed region-by-region according to the dominant culture there. I 
believe this will cause people to develop a more consistent and personal 
attachment to the people around them, thus developing social solidarity and 
unity.

however, should enough time pass, perhaps the people of Georgia should feel 
that they no longer identify as the same nation as the people of Spokane. This 
would eventually lead to the dissolution of our great nation, and I do not 
believe that's necessarily a good thing. To that end, there must be mechanics 
in place that bring people together not just locally, but nationally as well.

How do you preserve liberty while also ensuring freedom and justice for all? 
How do you grant people the power to determine their own fate, yet also the 
rights and freedoms that protect them from the cruel injustices of their fellow 
man, and the state? It's not an easy question to solve. National identity is 
not something you can demand, and yet it is necessary for the interim period 
between our cruel despotic past and our bright united future. Though I dream of 
a future where the nation-state is irrelevant, that future is still yet to 
come, so we cannot act as if it is here already. We must lay the foundation 
that the future we desire may be built upon, and to that end we need to utilize 
the structures that are present. Structures such as nations, which provide us a 
sense of protection from those we cannot know - a sense of dedication, to our 
collective community - a sense of safety, that implies our liberties and 
freedoms will be ensured by a mechanical organization that is larger than our 
community. Essentially, nations give us the hope for our present while we wait 
for the day when they are no longer needed.

The question remains - how do you develop and maintain national cohesion while 
also ensuring localized liberty? It cannot be done through culture, as culture 
is unique to each home. It cannot be done through litigation, as laws must be 
unique to each land. It cannot be done through force, as force deprives us of 
justice. It cannot be done through economics, as economics wielded as a weapon 
brings inequity and unbalanced hierarchies that surely shall topple. It cannot 
be done through any application of the state's authority, so it must be done 
using something that cannot be forced.

In this era, there are sentiments that Texas should desire to secede. This is 
just used as an example here, for the future may bear such sentiments from any 
land for reasons similar or dissimilar. So, say there is a state that wishes to 
secede in the way that Texan mythology describes. What would compel them to 
stay? What would compel them to stand united for our collective gain? Perhaps 
they could be swayed by gifts of gold or bloodshed, or maybe they simply could 
be allowed to do as they please. All three of those options are not desirable, 
for reasons that should be apparent. So, to ask again, how do you ensure 
national unity in the face of the desire for liberty from unity? Liberty 
implies a resistance against oppression, a pushback against the enslavement of 
another's will thrust upon an unconsenting subject. So, to resolve this issue, 
there must be a reduction in oppression. Ideally, elimination. However, 
defining oppression is difficult when so much of our interactions are 
determined by trade, national interests, and cultural contestation. There is no 
easy answer, but by redefining what a nation implies perhaps we can make the 
question irrelevant.

In a system such as the one I described, it perhaps would be better to describe 
it as a "federation" rather than a "nation". Federation implies a set of 
standard protocols that allow geographically disparate entities to coexist and 
interact in a mutually beneficial way. Much the same way that every apartment 
has a kitchen and bathroom, though it be more efficient to centralize them and 
have a communal dining hall or bathroom (the way a school dorm or a prison 
might be arranged), it is not ideal for our collective sense of liberty and 
freedom. In addition, the proposed distributed nature of our infrastructure and 
productive capacities would induce inefficiencies that cannot be ignored. So, 
perhaps instead of centralization or decentralization, perhaps specialization? 
For example, if 3-5 states were experts in a particular good or service, then 
they could compete amongst one-another for the best product (utilizing one of 
the beneficial impacts of capitalism), while also utilizing localized resources 
(reducing inefficiencies in transport) and increasing the resilience of 
production. This works well for physical goods, but services are more difficult 
because they imply that a person must be physically present in order to engage 
with them.

So for example, if a particular state specializes in a service, say, making 
pizza, then any other state which desires their service may contract with them 
to utilize their methods and practices in their own state. We all enjoy eating 
Domino's or Pizza Hut, but there is also space in our lives for more local 
brands that are unique to a region. So perhaps Domino's creates a contract with 
each state that states they may utilize their production methods and perhaps 
their specially made pizza dough shipped in from wherever their factories may 
be. In such a system as this, for each employee employed at one of these pizza 
chain restaurants, their wage will be paid to the employee (to facilitate local 
commerce) and to the state in which Domino's is from. Note, the company never 
receives a dime, but that is by design. Corporations are not people, they 
cannot wield money and they cannot vote. However they are productive and useful 
members of society, so they shall be utilized as tools to facilitate the 
enrichment of the lives of the citizens and the economic development of each 
region.

So. To reiterate, the employee in Arkansas is paid a wage of 30$ per hour, and 
the state in which the corporation is based (say, Oklahoma) is paid 30$ for 
each hour that employee works. However, these dollars are specific to the 
region, and cannot leave it - Oklahoma and Arkansas *must* reach an equitable 
arrangement where their dollars equal out. Balance is desired, as it brings 
stability and provides a foundation for future growth. If one side prospers, so 
does the other. Why should the Oklahoman have less than the Arkansan?

Person, family, neighborhood, city, state, nation, planet. This is a rough 
description of each "tier" of algorism. These rules apply at every tier, so 
though I said "state" and "nation" for the presented arguments they are equally 
relevant to the family and the planet.

In algorism, every month any unspent dollars are distributed to all of a 
person's open queues. Should a person have no open queues, then perhaps they 
may be distributed to everyone in the rest of the structure, to foster a sense 
of solidarity, or perhaps they are simply lost, as money unspent is money 
wasted. Either way, the relevant functionality is the dispersal of unspent 
currency. This applies to higher states as well, such as states - if a state is 
engaged in many profitable arrangements and fails to balance it's external 
budget, then the unspent dollars must be distributed to everyone else in their 
tier for the next month.

Ah, but this raises a critical question - dispersal to the tier, dispersal to 
the structure, or waste? I believe dispersal to the tier is best, though 
perhaps it should be a choice made in each instance by the representatives. Or 
perhaps it should be a requirement for them to choose a certain way - it's up 
to the people of that state, that family, that neighborhood, to decide what 
privileges their representatives possess. However, the options available for 
them to choose between are limited, as the mechanical interactions of these 
unit structures (the representative and everyone they represent) are 
necessarily defined by the system. As such, the options may be enumerated, and 
in doing so they are granted as options to be wielded by representatives as 
their constituents see fit.

The original question, the most critical question I believe, is how to preserve 
a sense of unity between tiers. How to ensure that there is no reason to 
abdicate our responsibility to preserving unity and fostering goodwill between 
the people of this earth. A proposed solution is to allow for the greatest 
freedoms, such that there is little reason to desire liberty from unity, 
however freedom is not enough - there must be mutually beneficial reasons for 
coexistence. Hence the idea that economics must be tied to national structure. 
If Texans would rather be part of their own structure, well then it is 
functionally impossible for them to trade (legally) between other states. That 
is not ideal, so it is much more appealing for them to work together and define 
their lives as they will while also co-habitating in the same national 
structure as everyone else.

Now, another example. Should Washington or Maine desire one day to become part 
of Canada, for example, they must necessarily seek exclusion from the United 
States market. They would bring with them only what they carry, and that's... 
not ideal, as most of the wealth of a nation is in it's interactions with 
others. But say they do not desire exclusion, and rather would instead prefer 
to simply trade with Vancouver or Quebec. External trade must be facilitated 
through a higher level, in this case the national level. Washington might 
request a certain type of good from Vancouver, and Maine might desire a service 
from Quebec. This request would be given to the national representative (or 
rather, the tier higher than the state) who would then develop a contract with 
the nation of Canada to purchase the type of good or service they desire. 
Assuming the canadians are still utilizing the capitalist mode of production 
and economics, there would need to be an exchange between American dollars and 
Canadian dollars. This is handled nationally, and those dollars can be 
circulated across the globe by canada should they desire. For example, the 
American dollars passed to Canada might be spent in Brazil, where they then 
find their way to England, and then to Australia. Then, several months later, 
those same American dollars are used to purchase a good or service from an 
American industry by creating a contract with the American government. Such a 
contract could be on the individual level or higher level, however as 
capitalism tends to decay all social fabrics that bind a group of people 
together leaving the naked individual alone, it tends to be on the individual 
level.

So, an individual in Australia purchases a widget on Amazon, which is 
manufactured in Ohio and shipped internationally in California. The Australian 
bloke (can I say bloke here? is that okay?) spends their cash which is then 
taken by the American government. Then, the widget is produced in Ohio and 
shipped to a warehouse somewhere before being sent to California where it will 
be brought on a boat to Australia. This trip involves three stops, Ohio, 
California, and Australia. However, as the product was bought on Amazon, which 
is a service, there is another entity in the arrangement which is the state in 
which Amazon is located - let's say it's in California as well. So, Ohio is 
compensated for the production and storage, California is compensated for the 
Amazon facilities and the shipment abroad, and Australia is given a widget in 
exchange for dollars (which are then disposed of, as they are not a true 
currency once internal but rather a form of debt that are sent abroad, to be 
redeemed at a later date.

The amounts that Ohio and California are compensated is determined by the 
contracts and arrangements they had in place when creating their industry.
