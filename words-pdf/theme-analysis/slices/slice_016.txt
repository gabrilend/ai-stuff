the point of roads is not to transport goods, it's to build rail lines upon 
once we've saved up enough materials to build it all in one go

boom, no more car pollution

free public transit that goes to each home

and is inalienable and considered a right, just as we have a right to walk on 
the sidewalk, so too shall we be able to get where we're going unimpeded.

leave cars on the racetracks and mechanic museums. we have a new approach 
that's oh so much better.

imagine if every road in the country was a train

and like, a continuously moving train that occupied all parts of the track. So, 
stretching like a massive game of Nokia snake, this giant conductorless system 
would keep everything in motion.

and maybe it could suggest points to redesign, according to the metrics on 
throughput and efficiency. Like "oh we need more solar panels to supply this 
region" or "hey this factory could be closer to the boats" that kind of deal.

CW: sexuality-mentioned



it's not wrong to be turned on by the thought of being the gender youre 
transitioning to. Your subconscious mind is yearning for a healthy sexuality, 
nothing more.

and if you aren't, if you're into "other people" like a weirdo, then yeah sure 
what I described probably sounds pretty weird. Oh and it's cool if you aren't 
sexually attracted to anyone either. Sometimes being ace is a phase because sex 
doesn't really fit into your life, and other times it's more something that 
defines you. It is the progenitor of all genders and sexualities that 
fluctuate, because it's based on the simplest binary of "yes sexual attraction" 
or "no sexual attraction" - with some extra variables to tweak like "sex 
positive/negative" or "cuddle-starved/cuddle-slut" type of ranges.

... anyway sexuality is weird and if yours made sense then so would that guy, 
and that person over there, and the person who lives down the street, and the 
other who lives in a blimp and jacks off into the sky calling it "bird poop"

city planners who thought "this low-income neighborhood has remained low value

the problem is, their heuristics are wrong. it's not low income because nobody 
wants to live there, it's low income because of racial inequality, or maybe 
it's next to a factory or something

or maybe it's just the culture of the zone. like, some people value some things 
to certain degrees, like "we don't want to charge for people to live" so the 
rents are significantly reduced (proportional to the rest of income)

the greatest trick that capitalism pulled on us was to convince us that the 
needs of a corporation were synonymous with the needs of an individual.

you, as a person, should apply yourself toward goals and ends that matter to 
you. And "getting money" is not a goal or an end, that's a means. Money allows 
you to achieve goals, which is why it feels so unfair that some people are 
just... born with the right to achieve all of their goals. For free.

Kinda makes me think that with great power should come great responsibility. 
And remember kids, money is power, because money is time and there's nothing 
more immutable than time. We're all sharing this single moment, yet somehow 
some people have more dominion over this moment than you or I. Why? Well, it is 
their birthright of course, because they were born into a family with wealth.

Achieving goals is a need, by the way, as precious as food or water. If you

You cannot base your argument on the assumption that a person should do as you 
suggest.

to do so is a form of circular reasoning.

"You should do this thing, and yet you aren't, which means you're wrong" 
doesn't work logically if you, the person suggesting the thing for this other 
person to do, is wrong.

Its a weakness in your argument, a flaw in your design.

"You should not kill other people" is generally regarded as a true statement, 
but it rests its power upon the conclusion that you shouldnt harm another 
person. "your rights end where another's begin" and all that.

If, however, that baseline axiom should change (that your right to kill someone 
ends as soon as another person's right to life comes into the picture) such as 
in the case when a person LOSES their right to life, for example if they're a 
nazi who is part of a death cult that actively seeks to destroy the lives of 
other people, then PERHAPS and maybe EVEN POSSIBLY it's possible that PERHAPS 
they, the nazi in question, should be slain. By you.

For example, if an AI was trained with the knowledge of how to commit crimes,

on. Oh also you should leave a trail of your actions so others can audit it and 
see exactly what you were doing at which time. But alas, cops are bogged down 
in paperwork, so much stuff that needs doing. If only we assigned them 
secretaries, and treated them like... managers, rather than individual 
contributors. Perhaps then they, being the collective applicator of the

I don't expect or demand anything from teenagers except perhaps "be a cool kid"

Even most adults when they mess up I just think "ah, well, they're trying their 
hardest, same as anyone"

And tbh I'd rather see a kid running up and down the aisles than burying 
themselves in an ipad

I think we, as a culture, built our society to demand too many "should"s from 
people.

"I should get a job" "I should study this thing I'm not interested in so I can 
make more money" "I should put out traps for the rabid wolverines so they don't 
start hanging out in my underwear" "I should pick up detergent at the grocery

Should is useless. Do; or do not. There is no should.

A teacher should help students learn, and perhaps guide them toward learning 
things that are broadly applicable instead of specifically applicable.

For example, let's say a kid wants to do a project and present their findings 
about various types of pokemon and their match-up strength against various gym 
leaders or whatever. Idk I don't really play Pokemon.

Anyway the teacher could see that project and think "Hmmm this kid is good at 
identifying strengths and weaknesses in various profiles, perhaps they would be 
a good talent scout or hiring manager" and they could nudge the kid toward 
learning useful skills for that kind of role like empathy, long-term strategic 
thinking, adaptation under unforseen circumstances (like, if your recent hire 
turned out to be a total asshat), that kind of thing.

Then the kid turns out to be a pianist and the teacher's like "well shit, at 
least I tried. Kid's got magic fingers though, you should hear him play."

The game designers are fully in charge of when and where the items get placed 
into the player's inventory. Surely they should have spent some time balancing 
that? No? They were too busy tuning the multiplayer combat mechanics within an 
inch of a marginal percentage point? Ah well competition's no fun if someone 
loses right? Not like there's gotta be a loser in every fight anyway...

when I get concerned about the political divide in my country, I think about 
this map from the New York Times of the number of political donations across 
the country before the 2016 democratic primaries.

I think we're gonna be fine. I'm not scared of Trump because rural areas, where 
republicans tend to be, have the same problems that everyone else does. Bernie 
Sanders was well known as someone who could talk to an average republican voter 
and sway them to his side. I remember watching videos of his interviews (in 
front of a live audience) on Fox News or CNN or whatever and at first, they'd 
be hostile to him. At the end, they'd give him a standing ovation.

I think we have more in common with other working class people than they do

Yes, I have very little faith in the democratic process in my country. 
Unfortunately, while democracy is crucial to fair, honest, and just 
representation, as you said it's unlikely that democracy would be allowed to 
exist if it threatened the power of the powerful.

Thus, our twisted form that sorta works, but requires a LOT of effort and a LOT 
of maintenance. More than the average person can give.

They've tuned it to be JUST dysfunctional enough to overwhelm our natural 
innate tendencies to contribute to "the tribe of tribes", while leaving it just 
functional enough such that if you work your ass off with ALL of the people who 
agree with you, then MAYBE you might get a measure on the ballot for something 
insignificant (which won't pass, because why would it?)

True, but that's just propaganda.* It does not define their actions, only the

Especially when the systems they use to exert their power begin to crumble 
under the weight of their god-like aspirations. Suddenly, they are not 
constrained by the rules of money, of bureaucracy, or of any other theology.

Suddenly, they are free. And a person's character shines through in moments of 
freedom and liberty.

But the crumbling system they endeavor to transcend also no longer binds us as 
well.

When we start to hire each other and pay in vegetables and rent, when we build 
community amongst our fellow humen, and when the temperature starts to rise, 
that is when we are strongest.

I don't mean that you stand around waiting for a player to wander nearby before

But that kind of coordination is hard. So why don't we just automate

If you want to automate capitalism, you must first automate Magic the Gathering.

There are several ways to win a match in Magic. You could reduce your 
opponent's life counter to 0, you could force them to draw from an empty deck, 
and you can give them 10 poison counters.

These are KPI's, and developing a critical path to reach them will depend on 
the composition of the player's deck. Each deck will approach the conclusion of 
the game in a different way, and developing solutions to reach those goals is 
part of each player's responsibilities on their turn.

Most people who are assholes are just traumatized and raised to be aggressive 
or violent. You don't defeat them with anger or hatred, you heal them by being 
kind and removing their power until they accept the responsibility of wielding 
it.

Some people though are just cruel, and they are quite rare. There's very few of 
them, and those that do exist typically are easy to find because they're often 
located in positions of power, like high-ranking politics, executives at cruel 
corporations, or other such places.

They are drawn to these places because power allows them to wield their 
cruelty, and they are allowed to become these roles because cruelty defeats 
kindness.

Kindness builds more, it creates, it generates, it improves, it brightens and 
it nourishes. But cruelty cuts and burns, it severs and it hardens, it 
dessicates the soul and corrodes the mind. It is seductive with it's promise of 
bounty, and it flatters your greed.

To defeat it, supply kindness. Remove power. A simple formula, but quite 
difficult.

@mybarkingdogs@freeradical.zone 

when we, societally, are forced to discuss fascists and such, they're getting 
what they want.

We cannot ignore them. We cannot hide them. They are true, they exist, and we 
need to deal with them.

I can say this because nazis are evil. Trans people are not evil, which is why 
their attempt to use the same logic falls so flat. Seriously, have you ever met 
a GOOD nazi? I highly doubt it, though their most "respectable" amongst them 
certainly try to make it so.

But good trans people are everywhere. Hell the old boogey-man, old-school 
communists, they're GOOD people too. They feed the homeless!

If we're bogged down in talking about their distraction / propaganda campaign, 
then we have no time or attention to devote to our own. And our stories are 
better for the soul.

The people who follow Trump are yearning for something they cannot describe.

In a boxing match, the coach will take moments to bolster their favored 
combatant. They'll give them words of motivation, tips for weaknesses in their 
foe they noticed, and reasons why they're taking hits. They are the mentor and 
tactician, and they are immensely valuable for the success of the student 
learner.

If I had to organize a debate like the one that I am watching now, I'd suggest 
that two bright eyed individuals should take a moment to discuss with their 
wiser directors before responding to each question. One minute to discuss, one 
to debate, one to respond.

Not only would it reduce the failures of improvisation, it'd give time to more 
accurately address concerns. Precision is important, but accuracy even more-so.

After the debate it could be aired with the discussion parts stripped out, or 
perhaps made into 3 different perspectives that you could watch one after 
another - each side's counsel session, and their combined response where only 
the younger gave words form.

I vote yes, because people don't like change. I think we need to build 
something that naturally evolves into communism - like for example prices that 
trend toward zero as production increases and waste decreases, or community 
structures that naturally build solidarity through their structure, form, and 
functions rather than through voluntary effort like a union. Because not only 
do people not like change, they're also generally lazy, typically preferring to 
be home eating sandwiches with their dog and watching TV than at work 
discussing labor conditions.

single plant in the area is useful for, I'm going to tell everyone else so they 
can help me gather them - my back kinda hurts from bending down all the time, 
but we still need these plants"]

wandering through a park or mapping out suburbia in their heads. The more you 
practice skills, not even for value but just for practice, the better you'll be 
at them. And don't you want your kids to be able to orient themselves? Don't 
you want them to be able to hike? Don't you want them to build proprioception 
skills by swinging a sword against imaginary foes? Hell they might even meet a

Listen, just because that cute robot or catgirl you met on Fedi doesn't live on 
the same continent as you doesn't mean that you are isolated.

It means you're talking to the wrong robot or catgirl.

Like, I'm sure they are perfect and absolutely get you in a way that nobody 
else does, but I guarantee there's someone who's like 98% as relatable who 
lives in the same state as you. And IRL friends are infinitely more valuable 
than internet friends.

Honestly, internet friends and scenes are mostly useful for feeling at home, 
feeling safe, and feeling connected. But feelings are not reality, and while it 
is necessary to feel good and safe and home, it is also necessary to BE safe 
and good and home.

Build community with people who live near you, build it with people that you 
LIKE that live near you, and build it remotely to be abreast of the world and 
it's goings-on. If you can do all three, you will feel and be safe.

How useful is a safe space if you must venture into danger when leaving it?

Most people don't have justice, especially not TRUE justice, and most people 
don't have hope (because most people don't really think about their 
circumstances enough to hope for something better), but I do believe that the 
kind of hope people have in a place without justice is vulnerable to betrayal. 
Doesn't mean it's not hope, doesn't mean it's not justice, it just means they 
can be betrayed if they cannot trust the justice they own and cultivate.

The difference between tactics and strategy is a level of abstraction.

Tactics are crucial, but context dependent. Strategy is ALWAYS useful as a 
method of planning.

If you typically play base-builder games like Starcraft or Age of Empires, try 
playing a game like Supreme Commander or Factorio - both of them are one level 
of abstraction up.

If you typically play arcade turn-based strategy games like Civilization or 
Catan, try going up a level of abstraction with Dominions 6, or any game 
developed by Paradox Interactive like Hearts of Iron, Crusader Kings, or 
Stellaris.

If you tend to play luck-based games like Poker or Monopoly, try playing an 
actual game instead of resolving a system that's predetermined by the initial 
board state and results of chance-based-mechanics with minor (if any) input 
from players, like perhaps Star Realms, Magic the Gathering, or Dungeons and 
Dragons. Each highlight a different type of choice in their mechanics. You 
should probably try all three if you care about strategy.
