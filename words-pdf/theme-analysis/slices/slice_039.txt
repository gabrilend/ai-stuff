It's funny, I've seen Andor season 1 twice now and the first time was when it 
aired live.

It felt so much more invigorating to my soul the first time. I wondered why, 
and I believe the reason is because it inspired me to go out and be brave as 
fuck. People were terrified, I saw it in their faces. It felt like the scenes 
on coruscant where everyone keeps their head down and looks around warily.

Now, things are fucking great outside. You can go on a walk and see people in 
the park. I love that.

I guess it didn't hit me the same way the second time around because I made 
progress on my "own personal revolution" (nemik to skene) and now the fear 
feels distant.

Season 2 was pretty great. Gonna watch that again soon.

CW: re: cursing-mentioned-andor-mentioned



"my own personal revolution" of course refers to to the internal struggle that 
people have against the implicit mental chains that whatever ruling class or 
system imposes upon our minds.

Part of the reason that queer people are important for the health of a culture 
is that they resist the cultural norms. To queer something, as a verb, is to 
fight a momentary revolution against the social chains that bind our actions.

They seek to use culture to force us to behave in a way that produces the 
outcomes they desire. 2.5 kids, white picket fence, hard working and very, very 
christian, at least if you live in 1950s America... it changes based on the 
environment.

The "personal revolution" I fought last summer, that liberated my sense of 
fear, is an ongoing struggle that countless others also wage. The "personal" 
aspect is the most frustrating - our struggles are all so individualized, for 
we live in an individualist society, that it's hard to help each other.

Yet still we try.

I never rest. Not mentally. I find it sooooo much harder to get moving again 
once I'm asleep.

But I've been sleeping lately, because it's "good for me" or whatever. Because 
I'm "burnt out and need to heal" or something.

Damnit why is it so much harder to stop snuggling someone than it is to pack up 
a tent?

I'm like the guy in Hot Fuzz, that one really good movie about cops. oops cops 
mentioned one second.

I'm always moving, but, I hardly ever seem to be able to get anything done. Why 
is that? Is the work just... endless? Am I ever a slave to my surroundings? Or 
am I just cursed with a mortal form, a form destined to toil in whatever way it 
finds itself contextualized in?

Maybe I should just stop complaining. Maybe work is it's own reward or

feel any emotions except focus, and the call to intercede on another's behalf.

suburbs are cool.

gotta work with what you got, right?

and America sure has a lot of suburbs.

suburbs can be kinda cool.

each street is like a village,

each subdivision is a small town

(a hamlet perhaps)

they all share a town square

it's called a grocery store parking lot

we tend to put cars there

but there's usually room for other things too.

suburbs can be cool

especially the ones with trees

the shade helps keep things from the sun

and most houses have a tree or two.

might even start to feel like a forest

if we knocked down the fences

everyone gets an open space facing view

because the backyards all run through.

suburbs can be dense

don't even need to throw up apartments

if all the yards are for gardens

and your neighbors watered yours too

(just don't overwater them)

(these here are special only I know their care)

(see this sign that says "dont water")

(that means I'll handle it thank you)

if the soil's wet thats good but it needs to dry

you won't get far with a "community" of dedicated people

what you need are teams. who can trust each other. you build them through 
brotherhood, and you trust them from their results.

for example if you wanted to organize a grouping or get-together, you'd put a 
bunch of people in a room or seven and let them while they're there work on a 
plan or a decision.

who needs tabling? who needs the chance to speak? just let them socialize and 
say "hey guys here's where you'll plan"

plans are hard without material so make sure you always prepare a pricetag on

all revolutions have a cost.

for example, in Andor Season 2 there is a character named Syril Karn. He's part 
of the first Imperial generation of children (human, at least, some species 
probably grow fast?)

this first generation reflects the good and the bad that the empire could be. 
There are aspects of good AND bad in Syril.

For example, his rigid adherence to truth, justice, and all the other things he 
holds dear are POTENTIAL good things that the Empire could have instilled 
within it's culture. Unfortunately, this spirit is lost when he suffers a head 
injury and dies as part of the Ghorman massacre.

Dedra Meero has some good qualities as well, such as her unflinching resolve 
and unwavering dedication to pursuing her charge. She's a hunter. Cats aren't 
evil just because they are ambush predators, and neither is she.

However, she IS evil because of all the evil things she does.

However, their deeds will follow them wherever they go. They are haunted.

writing a book is easy if you did well in English class in school.

All you have to do is take the three paragraph structure and repeat three 
times, like so:

--

One intro paragraph, three supporting paragraphs, one conclusion paragraph.

One intro paragraph, three supporting paragraphs, one conclusion paragraph.

One intro paragraph, three supporting paragraphs, one conclusion paragraph.

--

then, do one final 5 paragraphs where each body paragraph is about one of the 
three "essays" you wrote above, and congrats, you have a chapter.

Do that 6 or 9 or 12 times and you got a book. Easy.

If you ever need 4 body paragraphs, that's fine! If you want to write one 
single paragraph for an entire chapter, do that too! Heck if I were you I'd 
throw in as many pictures as you can, because they help break up the long 
blocks of text and allow the reader to orient themselves in the text. If you 
have one single paragraph it can often be difficult to remember exactly where 
to place your eyes, because they lack landmarks.

Algorism is a system designed to work for any level of organization. It scales.
It accomplishes this by abstracting individual needs into communal needs at a
certain level of size or complexity, and in doing so it enables people to take
responsibility both for their individual lives, but also the lives of the world
around them. This increased level of "stake" that people "hold" in their lives
will encourage them to develop their surroundings in a healthier way, thus
leading to a safer, saner, and more productive society for all.

How is this accomplished? There are many aspects to Algorism, and this note is
an examination of one particular facet - specifically, the requisition system
which delivers goods and services to entities larger than a single individual.

It may be best illustrated with an example. Consider a neighborhood - or, even
simpler, a suburban street, lined with houses. There may be 20-50 families on
that street, depending on it's length, so let's say there's around 30. These
families hold a common cause together - they all want their surroundings to be
generally pretty nice, clean, and decent. They may share many other things
besides, but these are things that most people can agree on.

These 30 families need supplies and infrastructure in order to have a good life
lived in their small little "town". Some common ideas for unification activities
include knocking down the backyard fences and letting them relish the shared
safe space for children, gardens, and nature. This is an example of a cultural
method for building a "good life" for them, however they need to have some sort
of "economic" method of good-life-building as well. The reason I say this is
because no matter what level of complexity you reach, there are always economics
involved, for an individual distributing blood cells to each of it's fingertips
all the way up to families sharing the food on the serving plate at dinner. Go
up higher and you have perhaps neighborhoods sharing commonly used tools or
resources, then cities and states and countries sharing people, talents, and
brotherhood.

Economics are a symptom of systems, not power. Power is coercive, it compels
others to obey thine will or else face retribution, but systems do not require
power in order to function. A system could be as simple as "you scratch my back
I scratch yours", which is a simple way that our ancestors learned about basic
cooperation. Systems can scale of course, and they need not be comprised solely
of verbal, mental, or legal agreements - computer systems, economic systems,
spiritual systems, systems of math or physics, all of these things are based on
the philosophical discipline known as "logic". Logic is fallible of course, it
is certainly possible to create systems of logic which are completely unsound
or invalid and which fall apart upon being used for the first time. However,
when considered with a scrutinous eye for detail, and referenced to the results
of the real world and it's endless permutations, logic can be an excellent tool
for developing organization and structure. Both of which are invaluable for all
humans when they seek to cooperate or coordinate.

If thirty people who lived near each other wanted to cooperate or coordinate on
the goal of "building a good life", they might reach for a logical method of
developing their surroundings toward how they feel is most suited to their needs
and demands. In order to do so, they'll need supply and infrastructure. The
question of acquiring such supply and infrastructure is ultimately up to them,
but the Algorist way of doing so is to utilize the queue system.

This system is related to queues as typically understood only in name and in
technicality, for the additional structures built on-top of the queues are more
than sufficient to differentiate it. When you, dear reader, hear the idea that
you'd have to wait in line in order to get your food at the cafeteria, you may
shudder and think about how you'd prefer anything else. After all, that's how
they did it in the Soviet Union, and there are plenty of horror stories about
how it took 10 years to buy a car, or how the factories were graded based on
weight so they'd sneak lead into all their lamps or whatever in order to seem
like they were doing well. They gamed the system, in a word.

However, America in 2025 is not as simple as the USSR in the mid-1900s. We have
computers now. We do not need to coordinate using paper and pencil. This enables
us to create things like web-UIs for Amazon, a world-wide distribution network,
or to build SQL databases full of every record we could imagine and store it on
a computer the size of a brick. There is no end to the power that computers may
bring to us, but with great power comes great responsibility, and the pragmatic
programmer will work tirelessly to reduce complexity of scale.

A queue is a system where the entities who are to be served, delivered, or
otherwise operated on are placed in line, and those which are placed first are
focused on with priority over those that entered the queue later. There are
many types of queues but this is the one we will use for this note. Using this
basic definition, we can see that there are many opportunities to implement
additional mechanics

Sometimes people convince themselves that they are a just and honest person, 
when they actually aren't.

Usually how this works is that they live their life as normal, and when their 
desires conflict with another persons, they'll relent and agree with the other 
person without voicing their concerns.

Then, when it's time for the other 50% of the time when they get what THEY 
want, they become stubborn and willful and resentful if they are contested.

It's always a struggle. It's always a battle. Why can't we just all get along?

the reason to know sign language is that you can communicate without making 
listeners aware.

double-band communication is useful for all sorts of mediums, just make sure 
you erase every track of pencil tracks.

every bit of intelligence matters, but if you force them to double their 
requirements, it makes it un-trivially harder to counterinvestimanage.

[what are you talking about "THE" reason, the reason is to talk to deaf people, 
dummy!]

(no dumb people are the ones who can't talk) (edit: and clearly I'm speaking, 
which means I gotta be smart, don't I?)

[that's actually really rude, you shouldn't say dumb because of the double 
meaning. It also means "lacking intelligence" which is not necessarily 
correlated to the disability in question. Therefore, the term is a term of hate 
or resentment, and thus should not be used unless you have genuine reason to 
inflict rudeness.]

we don't need more effort. We have enough effort. The required effort is a 
small fraction of our total reserves of effort.

what we need is to re-align our priorities.

For example, I think our entire research industry should focus on one project 
at a time. Everyone should make an effort to contribute, no matter the field. I 
think this would enable some EXCELLENT co-ordi-operat-ion.

I also believe that our neighborhoods should self-support each other. "For 
example, did you know that we have a daily delivery service where so-and-so 
drives to the grocery store, picks up everyone's orders, and then delivers to 
your front door? No, you don't have to pay for it. We don't really do that 
anymore. Well, you can buy things wherever if you want, but that's not how it's 
done around here." sorta vibes.

dependencies would be fuckloads easier if applications put their files in 
standard locations. actually it's better if they are at abstract locations - 
meaning it can be user defined for each file.

then, have some "sensible default" setting the user can configure which says 
"if an application wants to store a, say, config file, where would it put it?" 
and you'd say "oh in the ~/configs directory" then the install wizard would say 
"yes yes very good, and now where should I store user interface templates?"

then the user is like... "wat" because they don't know how the software works 
yet.

this solves 90% of all software dependency issues because all you have to do is 
keep a file with all the directories for each program. then, search through the

"RAH RAH FIGHT FASCISM" and the rest of me is like "there is no fascism 
outside, all you'll find is friendly faces and sore feet" and the rest of me is 
like "heh I did that" and the part of me that forgets is like "wait why did I 
do that" and the rest of me that remembers is like "because every ounce of 
mobilization, no matter how premature, teaches people and innoculates 
themselves to the struggle. By the time your foes are starting to think about 
doing something, your people will already have plans." and the part of me that 
forgets is like "okay but what if making struggle for struggle's sake just 
burns people out and makes them tired and causes them to have mh--- sui 
ideations and other similar things" and the part of me that remembers says "the 
struggle you provide teaches them to care for each other, which they 
desperately need to remember" o okay

tomorrow is a day for being patriotic, which is why I celebrated today. I feel 
like a nation must earn it's renown, and lately all I've felt is afraid. They 
aren't doing their jobs properly, and therefore fear is in our midst. In fact, 
some would argue that we've been divided into separate categories and urged to 
fight our discourage the other parts of the proletariate.

by the way, you shouldn't talk to anyone about anything, because it is 100% 
impossible to know who is a cop.

they've had like... however many years to develop a separate group of people 
(the rich and/or powerful) and the people (of colors and nations) who simply 
just... spies on the other, and records anything that they can.

indeed, the best way to encourage spreading of expertise and information 
(collectivism) is to reward people for their retention of rare items. Such as

there's no such thing as "gods of the war" or "gods of the grand harvest" 
because those events recur infinitely.

similarly, there are no "gods of war" or "gods of prosperity" because those 
conditions occur somewhere each and every moment.

similarly, there are no "temples of religion" or "statements to complexity", 
because those institutions are present in each and every [monetution/ummm like 
repositories of belief? conditions of logic built into human structural 
organizations? I dunno, it probably means something.]

Yes, it's true, that if we can't trust the political victors, then we can't 
trust that we all [deserved to be used, but pronounced like deserved to get

but we can't trust our political victors, because of simple facts.

Last summer the conservative majority supreme court removed several 
restrictions on the exectutive branch - essentially giving the political 
victors the ability to rule with more authority than a despotic monarchy.

This summer they are maximizing their armed forces (ICE, not the military,

if a protesters wanted to escalate, against riot shields they could use swords. 
Twist, and thrust under and up. Right through their skull.

then, when they learn how to brace, bring your own shields and stab through the 
wedged cracks.

or, depending on how they do it, guns and rifles.

too bad they can depend on a logistic network supplying them behind their back.

no violent revolution in this country will succeed without a mobilized civilian 
core. That is the true and most important resource they own. Delivery of 
supplies, ranging from physical violence gear, to food and emotional rations.

it must be necessary. or else it will be discarded.

meaning, scale your expectations of "necessary" according to the level of 
[plight/turmoil/meant].

demand centralized priori-chance, and you'll keep all that you can reclaim.
