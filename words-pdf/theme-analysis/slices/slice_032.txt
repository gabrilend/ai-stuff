rubbed my fingers in my arm-pits every once in a while because I figured it 
might help.

in strategy, the first move is always public knowledge, while the second is in 
reaction to the first, as a contestation.

This is good design because well designed games reflect reality, and the first 
move is very rarely a surprise. Timing can shock you, methods can scare you, 
but the strategic goals are almost always known in advance to both sides.

The third move is to challenge your foe's advances while striking in a new, 
unexpected way. The fourth almost always addresses the unexpected, often with 
force out of proportion to the impact of the third, leaving the second to be 
defeated by the first and third in tandem. The fifth is a feint, as the first 
and third come to bear against the fourth, while the sixth is a rapid retreat 
and attempt to regroup. The seventh should strike where they intend to be, not 
where they are. Beyond that you must press your advantages and shore up your 
critical weaknesses, while sacrificing the weaknesses that are not part of your 
win condition.

These rules are not set in stone

alright here's my plan.

so in red areas, there are a lot of trans people, leftists, and other people 
who just generally fear for their lives.

what if we all got in our cars and drove around the country in this massive 
caravan, going to each city we could manage, and just... drove around with 
loudspeakers saying "Hey, if you're scared for your life, come join us"

We'd give them food, gas, and if they didn't have a car they could find someone 
to ride with. Every day we'd drive for like, 4ish hours in the morning and 4ish 
hours in the afternoon, with a 4 hour break in the middle of the day. We'd all 
camp out in walmart parking lots or whatever and just hang out, have a little 
festival, maybe a barbecue, whatever, right?

Then, at night, we'd all circle up and protect each other. If things started 
getting hot we could have drones flying around doing reconnaissance. 

not only would this shared experience bolster our morale and numbers, it'd also 
radicalize us. We'd be spending all day hanging out with a bunch of other super 
radical people doing the most radically anarchist thing I can think of - taking 
care of each other.

Plus, we'd get an opportunity to test our logistics, in case we ever needed to 
do something like this in the future for less peaceful reasons. It's always 
good to practice, just in case.

For every one of us in the caravan, there should be 2-3, maybe even as many as 
10 people back at home, working their jobs or whatever and diverting funds to 
the cause. It would be most beneficial if we tried as much as possible to 
supply the caravan using convoys, people who drive an SUV or a van or some 
other car that is non-descript but laden with stuff we needed. That way we 
could practice logistics.

I think this wouldn't save us completely, but as a project it would help 
enormously. We'd save people's lives, we'd give them a way out, and we'd raise 
the temperature by 10 fucking degrees. And if it starts to peter out, if people 
would rather go home, then yeah! sure! let them! We hold no dominion over them. 
They could just drive home, or catch a grayhound. Heck we could even offer to 
pay their bus fare. No obligations, no restrictions, just us doing our thing 
and protecting our people.

when playing co-operative strategy games, a build focused purely on 
self-defence and community organizing can easily fail your allies. You cannot 
win with a purely defensive build, you must have offensive capabilities as well.

We've been trained from a young age to believe that offensive = bad, wrong, 
evil, but that's simply not true. You cannot execute a flanking maneuver 
without pushing forward behind enemy lines, where you can hit them in their 
sides or rear.

Trust me, flanking is the best way to defeat a foe, because they are forced to 
split their attention not only between multiple enemies but also multiple 
directions.

The more shots on target, the better your chances of success, because most of 
the time it only takes one hit to win.

In addition, sometimes it's important to *intercept* your foes, either as they 
flee or to protect a vulnerable friend that is being pounced upon or flanked.

When we have the freedom to act, when the hours of our days aren't spent 
keeping a roof over our heads or feeding our children, then we will develop the 
logistical infrastructure to deliver whatever you need. 

It's not like it's an unsolvable problem, we just need to do it. But we can't

Problem: there are trans people and leftists and people of color and plenty of

how do we help them? They need to be given the tools to escape those conditions

However, many of them are poor. They lack the resources to escape, even if they 
had the tools. These are who I think of the most, for they have the least to 
leave behind.

A solution: what if we got a bunch of people together and drove around to every 
red place we could find and invited them along? We could pay for their food and 
gas, and potentially save their lives.

I think it would help if we could stick together. Not only would we have time

a large group of people traveling across large distances.

In terms of people, we'd need some to drive, and some to stay home and supply 
resources like dollars or... other things.

I'm thinking 2-3 staying at home but potentially as many as 10 per driver.

yo I've suggested like 15 different economic systems by now you should know 
that I'm not at all attached to any of them, and odds are half of them wouldn't 
even work. People write books about this shit (books I haven't read)

Whatever I suggest is for ad-hoc organization only

but I guarantee that every single fucking one of them would be better than 
capitalism. Fuck the system.

the USA is fed by undocumented immigrants who have no other options. I won't go 
into which kind of slavery it is, but you can figure it out yourself.

If those workers are deported (or worse), the USA suddenly becomes 
significantly closer to famine.

We need them. We need to pay them fairly, obviously, but in a purely selfish 
way we need them in order to eat

I'm on half rations dollar-wise, but 1.5x rations nutrition-wise.

"oh boy, formless gruel for breakfast again. Can't wait. Maybe I'll splurge and 
put extra jelly on my PB&J for lunch."

It's healthier to eat rice, beans, and vegetables, with some fats added in via 
butter or oil.

The goal is to build up fat stores that are high-value. When your body has 
excess calories, it takes whatever nutrients are CURRENTLY in your system and 
stores them in fat cells, like stocking a pantry. If all you eat is cheetos, 
your pantry is gonna be useless. It'll just slow you down. But if you have 
highly nutritious foods, you will perform better as your body consumes the fat 
when it needs to feed, but you haven't eaten much lately.

... I should apply for SNAP. Gonna do it right fucking now.

@RationalizedInsanity 

Magic Survival might not work then, as it's a "single stick shooter" where 
movement is controlled with a virtual joystick and other actions are performed 
automatically.

There is more than one control scheme in the options, so it might be worth 
fiddling with, but octopus arms are hard to overcome in a non-turn-based game. 
Good luck finding games that work ❤️

I can't cancel my internet because I use it to work, which almost pays enough 
to cover rent, and nothing else.

It's hard to avoid spiraling when you run out of money. Every time this happens 
to me I start feeling things

like... am I good for society? Society doesn't want me, clearly, because I 
don't have any money. And currency is how you measure demand, right? It's 
literally a measure of value.

But then I think of all the homeless and poor people and, like... I value them, 
so what if they don't have dollars? It's literally just paper. Or bits in a 
mainframe that nobody knows how to program anymore.

So if they're valuable at least to me, yet me, with my 67$ in the bank and 127$ 
internet fee, is not valuable to me... Then what's the discrepancy?

I'm not trying to be hard on myself, it's not my fault that I bleed money, but 
I still feel terrible.

yourself fast.

hell yeah, can you improvise? I played as a kid and subsequently forgot it all. 
But now I'm trying to relearn, but only by just... playing until I find 
something that sounds good. No lessons, no tutorials, no sheet music (which I 
can still very slowly read) just me and my piano with it's keys.

I usually curl up with Magic Survival before bed, or if I'm waiting for 
something else to happen and I want to calm down. It helps to have my brain 
working on my character's build rather than... whatever it is that worries me.

I recently sacrificed games though. Haven't played any in like a week. Which is

I've had multiple people close to me who don't read my writing tell me that 
"you can't overthrow capitalism with poetry" and... Yeah maybe they're right. I 
have zero reason to believe that anything I've \*ever\* written has \*ever\* 
had an actionable impact upon the struggle. I have no reason to believe that 
people are more radicalized, motivated, or otherwise inspired. I have several 
reasons to believe that all of this was just an exercise in my own narcissism 
and delusion.

So I'm deleting my Mastodon account, and moving forward I probably won't update 
my website very much. Everything I do will be localized, regional, and 
hopefully more useful.

It feels like I'm abandoning the idea of a nation in exchange for a tangible 
village. I'm fucking depressed about it. \*I like nations\*. But I like people 
more. So if you'd rather I keep my thoughts to myself and instead feed the 
homeless, aka a bunch of people who aren't gonna take up arms against our foes 
and instead will consume our time and resources while we practice organizing on 
them, then yeah sure fine whatever. I'll do it. If you'd rather I keep posting 
\*content\*, ugh, fucking too bad, should have done something about it while I 
was active.

If I'm ever rich I'll hire an editor to turn whatever the fuck I've been making 
into a book that I'll give away for free. I probably will never be rich though, 
and instead will burn every bridge I can get my hands on and suffocate on the

there is a requirement for a simple, easy to set-up, and easily replacable
system which can be used for comms.

Specifically running a variety of different services, such as fediverse
instances, matrix for text-comms, VoIP, and distributed computing using Chapel
or DistCC or other such capabilities. In addition, it should be able to run a
file-server and a web-server which hosts an HTML page for the user.

All of this functionality should be operational out-of-the-box, with minimal
configuration required. No more than adding a checkbox to a config file in order
to activate each individual service.

This box should be cheap, and easy to provision. An image must be made, and
some bash scripts should be written to easily configure it.

In addition, there should be rudimentary programming capabilities included, just
in-case a user is left with no other options. It should come pre-configured with
SSH access out of the box, so it can be remotely controlled, and the languages
included should be:
   C/C++
   Python
   Lua
   Bash
   Rust
   Chapel
This should cover most surfaces in terms of programming capability requirements.

In terms of hardware, it need be little more than a SoC such as a Raspberry Pi
or other such hardware. It needs at a minimum an ethernet port, and USB ports.

The box itself should cost no more than 40$, excluding provisioning and the cost
to pay back whatever capital investments are necessary to create such a thing.

ad-hoc economic systems with automated judgment given by an infinite amount of

Every judgement applies a bonus / malus to the "value" of commodities

seriously just, consider yourself a glorified powerpoint, but to get to the 
next "idea" you had to interact with the mechanics.

some people would like the "arcade" style better, where you play one random 
game, then another, then another, with short matches and un-complicated 
mechanics. Easy to pick up and go.

same for like, Unreal Tournament or Mario Kart or Mortal Kombat or Super Mario

compared to the at-home "story" style missions, where you do something 
platforming or area-based-combat like Dark Souls or World of Warcraft

seriously I think if Dark Souls "colored" where the boss was going to swing to 
you'd find yourself just playing World of Warcraft (at least, the dungeons and

could add it to beans, maybe with hamburger instead. plus a little ketchup and 
you have a pretty good bean stew.

vitals, for the organs, vegetables, for the minerals and vitamins from the 
fruits.

modern-fantasy

what if heroes kept their gold in their house instead of their guild

what if you played a D&D game in a Majesty town (guardposts near known threats)
marketplaces, most people live in castle (peasants at least) - only heroes live
in farms, where they work most of the time except when out on adventure

the guilds are for training and gathering parties

one guild type

just one

recruiting adventurers doesn't give you warriors, or rangers, or rogues

it gives you adventurers, who wander the forest and encounter the leftovers of
the various conquests and spoils you, your majesty, has encountered

three options there are

invite into your kingdom (friendly)
farm for EXP and materials (neutral)
utterly slay in return for a limited amount of high value and unique resources
(unkind)

... though monsters care not for kindness, seeking only gold so that they may
    swallow it whole and carry it until they rot.

what do heroes need gold for? why, that's the trick isn't it? gold is required
for magic, resources, and manpower. Can use it to invite people to these shores,
or for casting a powerful spell that turns the enemy's fortress into solid gold

can also trade through the economy, and wouldn't you know it by doing so you can

putting a library book back on the shelves before your hold expires.

except this time, there's a note inside, and you left it for the person who you
told to check each day for this particular book to be back on the shelves.

then, you can write in your book when the next letter will be arriving (about)
and they'll check in the newly specified book.

or, you can request a response, to validate that people are still listening.

you could say "please put a note in [random obscure book] around page 34."

meaning, "I'm going to check every day for this book to go missing, then return
the day after I notice it's gone. If it's out of place, well, then someone
probably had it reserved before my friendly. Or maybe it's being sorted, and I
should keep looking until I find the note I need. Or maybe I've been DISCOVERED
and now my favorite penpal and I need more to read."

because, like, how else are you going to make friends if not by leaving them
notes in the bookstore or putting your own books on the shelves?

damn libraries, always making it so hard to add copies. They're always
laminating and cataloguing and ugh it's so frustrating. Why are there so many
books!!! we write too much!!! just put it in the printer, and then you can have
a new copy whenever you'd like. The others can just be recycled, and bam
suddenly we never have inventory.

what do you mean we didn't pay the subscription? what do you mean it's memory
just "went out of place"? do you think we wouldn't have backups of this kind of
thing, or do you think it's just "oh so commonplace"? It's not always about the
literature, y'know. sometimes it's about the knowledge you gain with your head
in a book, a different one every day.

ah, well, sometimes there are dark secrets to be found, and sometimes you must
read from a ways away. BUT no matter what language a story is in, it follows
certain rules, so spend enough time in a foreign library and you're BOUND to
find something to [evil is afoot]

what if they're beguiled, so what if they are deceived? We can take our time to

they please. Just... without billionaires and endless layers of bullshit

Hey. Remember that night back in Boulder when we were just friends and sitting 
on your bed drinking chocolate milk with cinnamon? I don't like chocolate milk 
or cinnamon but I drank it anyway because I wanted to be close to you. Anyway 
hope you're well, felt compelled to get that off my chest for some reason.

Message 2:
Hey. I was thinking about that time when I was leaving your house and laughing 
to myself about something and you called out "I love you!" to your boyfriend 
who I set you up with and I reflexed "I love you too!" and I wanted to crawl in 
a hole and die. I felt like I had just called the teacher "mom". We only hung 
out a couple times after that.

Message 3:
Yeah so there's one more thing I can't stop thinking about now that your on my 
mind. Sorry it's like 4am for you, it's only 2 for me so it's fine I guess. 
Anyway that one time when you told me your greatest fear was terrorists and I 
saw genuine panic in your eyes. Like... One moment everything's fine and then 
you said that to me and I almost cried. I don't remember why I spent the rest 
of the night as I couldn't sleep thinking of ways to tell you that terrorism is 
9 times out of 11 done by the right wing. I don't think it's important, 
honestly, but I'm glad my mind wouldn't let me sleep.

Message 4:
It's not fair that everyone gave you shit for being the token lesbian 
republican, like yeah maybe you leaned into the trump thing a bit hard but 
like, first term trump honestly I could see as... Well, I almost said 
inspiring? Maybe you just inspired me. I honestly was resigned to Clinton and 
then the same bird flapped your wing instead of mine and... Anyway. The past is 
dead, yeah? Do you still follow him in my stead? I fear there will be millions 
dead. It's not irrational to fear what he has literally said, on television. 
How's the phrase go... "ancient tragedies lend credence to modern perils" I 
think it's supposed to rhyme in its natural language.

Message 5:
Wow okay uh, sorry to bring this up again I'm honestly being such an asshole 
right now. I honestly don't think about you often but like, now that I am its 
kinda just coming all out. We last spoke almost a decade ago?? So. Whatever 
imma roll with it.

There was this cute girl who was into Nintendo and stuff and obviously I was 
into her, but we didn't have any social circles in common except for you, if I 
remember correctly. Then you broke up I think? And I didn't really see her 
again. Anyway I had a crush on her while also crushing on you, and literally 
half of our dorm. Polyamory, yeah? That whole year I didn't have sex though, 
not even once, because all of my friends were like 4 years younger than me and 
I was worried about power dynamics. But I still bought us all vodka and weed 
without asking for profit because I wanted to be a shitty friend, I guess. "hey 
kids let's go to the water store where they sell intoxicants that make your 
life harder"

The year after that I didn't get laid either because I got it in my head that 
it was a good plan to turn my penis inside out and you know what? It was 
totally fuckin' worth it. No time like 2016 I say, the worst year ever, which I 
spent primarily in pain. But uh, that was the year I got into weed and 
Overwatch, which... Helped I guess.

I guess?

It kinda turned me into a communist. Or maybe that was my best friend who 
shared the same name as me. He lived upstairs and always seemed pretty cool to 
me. Like he knew what everything was about. Really though, he just watched a 
lot of youtube podcast videos about world events and history and sociology and 
political scientific theory and the more he learned the more he came to realize 
that power begets power, and power corrupts unilaterally. So he did the natural 
thing which was to become a communist, and I was totally there for it. Having 
liberal parents meant I was all "grrrrr Republicans are ruining the country and 
the world, I'm an angry 14 year oldddddd" and like, leftists are the most 
natural extension of that aren't they?

Turns out they aren't really the tips of the feathers as I expected, but rather 
the eyes, the heart, the soul. Politics is fake, yo. I don't know how to tell 
you, but it's just power and hierarchy all the way down.

We've built our own prisons, not of bricks, sand, or stone, but rather of 
promises of what each of us owns. That works, I guess, if your goal is to keep 
things aligned, but these days it kinda feels like our pyramids are crumbling 
under our feet.

... Why am I talking about politics? Oh yeah, because when I dropped out of 
school because I couldn't handle the mechanization of human capital when 
applied to myself, I swore to each of you that I would drive up every weekend 
to do family dinners. I'd make spaghetti and stroghanoff and macaroni and 
goulash and all of the other things my mom would make for me.

Kinda gave up on that pretty quickly. Turns out I'd rather spend time making 
out with my girlfriend who I was super-duper-too-carefully tiptoeing around. 
She was... Too young for me. We broke up when my new coochie decided to bleed. 
Fuck, I hate it.

Anyway. Turns out potlucks are political these days, which is why I bring it 
up. Did you know that leftisms plan for resisting genocide is literally just to 
feed people? Like, fuck I suppose. It's a start. "why does everyone have to 
have an agenda these days, why can't I just spend time in the park" said 
someone to me as I asked if she'd like to meet some friends that she reminded 
me of. Oh, I dunno, because you and me are about to become a criminalized 
people?

... I need to stop. I swear you're more a person to me than any political 
theory ever could be. Like yeah, "fuck the right, fuck the reich, fuck me 
tonight" but getting caught up in grand narratives is like building a mental 
ship in a bottle. Yeah, it's pretty cool, but... What does it matter?

Oh. Right. Power. That's what matters. That's all that matters. Well... I'm 
sick of power. I do not consent. They say that in times of trouble, chess is 
better than solitaire, and I'll explain why - when our hierarchies crumble, 
when CEOs are gunned down in the streets and homeless people finally have clean 
sheets, the only place to place yourself in relation to others is within a 
network of trust and respect. Chess is better than solitaire. Under capitalism, 
it's you against the world. Dog eat dog, you only get what you can swallow from 
the rotten corpse of liberty that everyone's gnawing on. Under whatever comes 
next, you get what you're given, which hardly seems fair, doesn't it? On one 
hand, under capitalism, you can rely on your own hands to procure your fate and 
fortune. Under... Whatever comes next, your hands are built for whatever you 
want them to do. But, only a few people want to use them to make food. Hence, 
why chess is better than solitaire. What would you do, if you could give away 
all that you own and not go wanting? Isn't that sorta like our own garden of 
eden?

... I wrote a poem about that once. Twice. I'm a poet now, ha. As if that has 
ever been worth anything.

... I once told you that identity politics held no place in the modern day. I 
said that because I had learned about it in class, queer theory in fact, and 
yet applying his teachings was not enough for the professor to excuse my lack 
of reading. We had a lot of stuff to get through. Hence why I dropped out - I'm 
more of a do-er than a read-er. Though I do read quite a lot, just not anything 
useful.

Are all hobbies wasted time? Are they only useful to keep us satiated while we 
stand in line? One of these days we're going to wake up and realize that we're 
the adults in the room, and that's scary. I speak from experience. "mom" they'd 
call me, and damnit why did I have to leave? Fuck. Why cant I be perfect, to 
me, internally, all I see are flaws. Mistakes. Patterns. I look in a mirror and 
I see a bad person - 10 minutes later, I look in the mirror and see a god. 
Somehow, I don't think either of me is right.

I'm a gemini. Apparently that means I'm duplicitous. I think it just means I 
don't know what's right, only what feels good. I do try to align to how I think 
I should *be* good, but who can say if that's fine and good.

... Whatever. I'm going to regret this. Sorry for being weird out of the 
fucking blue.
