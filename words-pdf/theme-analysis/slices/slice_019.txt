the fly taps the window, to be let out.

the door is just over there, from which blows fresh and clean air.

yet the fly taps the window.

do I get up, to let him out, with a cup and paper? if so, there'll be more 
flies, tapping on the window. but a fly will be free.

do I remain, and let him struggle in vain? to do otherwise is to act against 
it's nature. the nature of a fly is to tap at windows, which is a nature we 
humans created with false illusions of free and open air - a window is natural 
now, yet the fly remains, tapping on the window.

give or take a million years, and a fly would adapt to our windows. they'd grow 
smarter, or bolder, or simply would search for doors through which breathe 
fresh and clean air.

but that fly won't live for a million years, and neither will I nor the window. 
yet flies, I's, and windows remain.

am I the fly, tapping without success? I yearn for the rapidly warming sky.

am I the window, showing visions of false success? I wonder when I will die.

or am I as I am, just I.

then, after a period of a year or three or five or however many, they can 
become citizens automatically. As long as they don't commit any serious crimes 
- that would reset their "citizenship timer", and if it's severe enough or 
enough of a pattern, they could be deported to whichever country they'd like.

they're good practice for people learning to knit, or practicing a new pattern,

you.

picture of a notebook page. there is a diagram illustrating a passive energy

the water boils from the heat and rises upward, spinning a turbine in order to 
charge batteries or generate power for other uses.

every night, the left-over sediments must be brushed from the basin, for if 
they build up they will not conduct heat from the copper as well.

can also be used to distill water in a pinch, however keep in mind that 
distilled water is unsafe to drink because your body will be depleted of

toxic heavy metals or plastic pollution, and minerals can be added in later.

picture of a notebook page illustrating a carbon-neutral air conditioning 
system.

the system is primarily comprised of two deep holes (as deep as a well) with a 
metal pipe around the walls in order to keep water out.

these holes are connected at the bottom, forming a "U" shape. At the top, there 
are two fans, one at the entrance and one at the exit, pushing hot air in and 
pulling cold air out.

if this system is insufficient to cool the air (perhaps if a deep enough depth 
cannot be reached) then lateral pipes can be added which circulate air for a 
longer period of time, and cause the hot air which rises to be circulated 
longer than the cold air which sinks.

it can only get as cold as the bowels of the earth will allow, but that's 
plenty cold enough for human comfort. no matter how hot the air gets, if the 
pipes are long enough they will reach the coldest temperature possible, however 
that temperature is never going to be so cold as to freeze water, for example.

I can help with that.

I recommend looking at Ollama, which runs an HTTP server on your local machine 
(hope you have a decent graphics card)

then, script some behavior you'd like to implement using Lua and the LuaSockets 
library. Also dkjson to handle the json parts.

then, all you have to do is construct a prompt based on the variables and 
desired input/output and push it into a json packet and send it to the HTTP 
server. It's less complicated than it sounds.

what you want it to do and your implementation for it is the hard part. But 
perhaps this project of mine will get you started:

(I can copy-paste it too if you'd like)

in peacetime, one may live as they define. they can be kooky and precious and

suddenly life fades from view and all you are left with is perfect clarity.

I'd like to clarify why I feel the way I do about the situation at hand.

one.

[1/5]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CW: re: uspol



the first reason I feel the way I do is because the supreme court recently made 
a decision that made it constitutional for people to be jailed or fined for 
sleeping in public.

homeless people, by definition, have no place to (reliably) go but public 
spaces.

therefore, by existing in their environment, they are criminals.

a criminalized people is genocide.

I cannot respect the legitimacy of a legal system that would condone genocide.

[2/5]

 -> file: fediverse/2491.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CW: re: uspol



the second reason is that the supreme court recently repealed the Chevron 
doctrine, meaning experts and specialists in government positions are now 
unable to perform their jobs unless they are loyal to the party in charge.

this is an extreme form of authoritarianism unheard of outside of 
dictatorships. It is tyranny, to demand allegiance in order for the government 
to function.

if the experts are purged, the decisions made by the systems they once upheld 
will no longer necessarily be tied to reality. this is one of the primary 
reasons why the Soviet Union fell into decay, and I will not tolerate that flaw 
to be introduced into our domain.

[3/5]

 -> file: fediverse/2492.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CW: re: uspol



the third reason is that I am a patriot, and the supreme court recently gave 
the president legal immunity. The president has always been a citizen first, 
for the government is of the people. However, with legal immunity, they would 
be considered closer to a king than a citizen.

they would dismantle our democracy and institute a de-facto monarchy. This is 
unacceptable here.

[4/5]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CW: re: uspol



The supreme court may have made these three decisions, but they did so at the 
behest of capital. Perhaps not directly, but I do believe in the future tomes 
will be written about how and why we ended up here. Perhaps they are already 
being written.

I will not stand idly by any longer while our country decays. I will not 
tolerate the corruption, the pollution, the intentional division, and the 
fanned flames of hatred.

The only thing on my mind right now is the extinction of fascism, the 
replacement of capitalism, and the freedom of all those enslaved.

ethical use-case for LLMs: guessing string-based keys for a key:value pair 
dictionary.

hallucinations are okay and encouraged because they're probably statistically 
related to what you're trying to guess.

run it in a loop, each time adding to an array of strings that you've tried. 
use that array in the prompt saying something like "hey, can u guess the 
related word? it's similar to this: [initial word] and it isn't one of these: 
[array of strings you've tried]"

and yes this is a solution looking for a problem but I try to be as charitable 
as possible. you could use a lightning-fast model (read: low energy 
requirement, therefore ethical) because it's just guessing related words.

to overhaul our systems and institutions with something that requires a 
master's degree to understand the nuances of (or a lot of dedicated reading)

We must replace capitalism. People like the concept of capitalism for it's 
simplicity, for to them its just "work a job, get dollars, go spend dollars, 
get stuff"

That's pretty darn easy. But capitalism is an evil beast, and power accretes 
power.

So, capitalism must be replaced with something simple which abolishes power. 
After the war, it can be replaced.

If you're building a long-term residence in a place that gets cold, consider 
building a Rocket Mass Heater.

It is highly efficient and it allows for long-term storage of heat energy in 
the mass of the home.

In addition, it provides a hot stove surface which can be used for boiling 
water or other cooking tasks which do not require a precise temperature.

It is highly efficient as the smoke from the flames are sucked out of the 
living space and remain inside the barrel of the heater, where they are slowly 
consumed. there is very little exhaust, but what is there is CO2 which is 
deadly to breathe, so caution must be taken (as with any fire-based heating 
option)

it's okay. If I were to direct something to be more proactive, my words

needs to be built up through repetitious application of something's mechanics.

to strike seems similar to me to overcoming situational paralysis.

battle, only to find the battle has yet to arrive, your duty is to learn the 
environment, learn the people, learn the resources at your disposal and 
identify places that would be ideal for entrenchment.

Think of the difficulties of the area - where are the rivers? the mountains? 
the natural or man-made barriers?

think of the infrastructure - how are supplies getting here, what organizations 
are active here, what are the demographics, could any of them be more 
productive? In what ways?

action is not necessary until action is apparent. but intelligence, and the 
mind to use it, is invaluable for you and for any planning you might see fit to 
do.

some suburbs are full of old people. Some have new parents. Some are for

in the past, logistics were often carried by horses.

without the additional speed and terrain-overcoming-capability, it's difficult 
to ensure a party on the march could have enough supplies of critical items 
like food and water.

especially water.

natural sources can only be trusted if you're in the mountains. if the river 
flows past farmland, or places with wide-open areas or forests that animals 
might congregate, you're more and more likely for it to be contaminated. 
dysentery kills faster than dehydration because you poop out all your hydration.

boiling water only goes so far, eventually you'll find yourself in a desert.

hopefully at that point you can rely on car-based infrastructure to deliver 
truckloads of goods. and remember - busses can ferry goods around in a city 
just as well as they can carry workers. Might need to remove a seat or three, 
and make sure the weight tolerances are in order. helps if you disperse it

best way to stay hydrated is to take small little sips every 15-30 minutes 
rather than down a huuuuuge bottle once every 6 hours

the reason is that your body absorbs water like a sponge might. but, it's a 
slow-acting sponge, and the water only stays in your blood for so long before 
it's filtered by the kidneys.

meaning you're only hydrated for a short while, and then you gotta whiz

meanwhile if you take little sips often throughout the day, you'll always have 
sweat to cool you down, and you'll need to pee a lot less - probably only 
enough to remove materials your body can't use from your food and such. also 
waste-products from your cells as they work.

which is to say you'll pee less, and it'll be less and less useful for um 
"recycling" if things get dire. so... become un-piss-drinkable! you'll be 
healthier anyway!

why the heck don't light-rails and subways carry logistic trains too? could cut 
down on delivery trucks, especially if train stops went right to the factory.

downside is trains are expensive, and sharing space on a train is hard because 
whenever you have to split ways you gotta re-shuffle things around and 
reorganize and it's a whole thing.

maybe... modular train units that can be swapped between batallions - er I mean 
train cabooses? that way they can carry their own supplies and split off when 
needed, while still being pushed along by the rear train conductor sitteth. 
that's how trains work, right?

or is there like, a frontline snow-piercer type thing where it has a huge 
snow-blower that kicks up a huge storm, so that the rest of the

less important in a place like a suburb because the sight-lines are pretty 
similar.

more important in a city or the country, where there are plenty of long-range 
lines of sight.

also, keep in mind that the garages of suburban dads are like goldmines for the 
future backlines. So try not to blow them up.

two people riding on bikes down each and every street in a city

the first, blowing a whistle

the second, 5-10 seconds later with a megaphone

"people of the city, we have come with a mission. please report to your nearest 
grocery store"

will probably have to ride past a few times

maybe with some more clarifying lines

i've been pressured by some of my annoying fans to go visit the hospital today 
because my hip is getting increasingly worse. so that's what I'll be doing with 
the first half of the day.

but hey! it's tuesday! my favorite pizza place has a discount on tuesdays!

[suddenly 4-chan uses that tidbit of info the precisely calculate my 
coordinates using the power of gps and autism]

also I realized "undivisible" isn't a word, doh. it's "indivisible" 
jeeeeezzzzzzz

was a stupid name anyway, we can think of something better on the walk.

or drive, because logistics right?

if you're gonna be Litz Craig you wanna be fast, too. practice is nice and all 
but wouldn't you rather face an un-entrenched foe?

... let's be real they've been entrenching for a long-ass time.

still, organization is critical for speed.

problem is traffic of course... its important to flood the streets so that our 
allies know we're not fucking around.

None of my specifics are true 😅

an army on the march in the modern day could follow a road and nap in the shade 
during the height of the day. night-time is easier to navigate when you don't 
have to worry about trusting the feet upon the stones before you.

what better way to build tangible support for Ukraine than to get a bunch of 
people in motion, building acclimation to weather, learning tactics and sharing 
beliefs and ideology, and ready to fuck shit up and gather them all in one 
place, ready to move, and then ship them to the frontlines?*

just saying if vanquishing treasonous fascists isn't your cup of tea we could 
just hop across the sea and deal a crippling blow to autocracy half the world 
away.

veterans are much scarier than new recruits. and if we're handling the backline 
stuff, we could get used to terror.

veterans are scarier than recruits

EDIT: * maybe not the frontlines for most, that's a scary place to be

EDIT2: between the annexation of Crimea and the full invasion of Ukraine, 
western powers sent warriors to Ukraine to bolster their foremost. This 
radically empowered them to stave off the initial Russian assault, and while 
the doctrine learned was quickly obsoleted, the practice of soldiering never 
goes away.

Insurance does not ensure your health

it just ensures the doctor that you can pay

unrelated, but I just went to the urgent care and they turned me away. they 
don't accept the state insurance. the nearest place that does is a much longer 
bike ride away, and for a person in the heat with a damaged leg... I think I'll 
take an uber.

@nus@mstdn.social 

as long as I don't do anything they haven't, then there's a reasonable claim to 
be made that arresting me would be enforcing the law partially (as opposed to 
impartially)

yet more examples of the ways our false democracy has betrayed our trust.

we'll see though. I have faith in those who hold power over me. I trust that 
they understand the implications of this most recent supreme court session.

they broke the law first. I'm trying to restore it and rebuild it in such a way 
that it is immune to the injustices and misdeeds that spelled it's current doom.
