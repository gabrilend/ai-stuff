work isn't special. The only thing truly unique about humans is our ideas and 
our intentions. Action potential is best left to the machines, imho, so we 
should prioritize that as much as possible.

once infrastructure is in place, it's fine with a bit of maintenance. So why 
don't we all live in the garden of babel? Errr hanging gardens of bablenonya, 
as it used to be called.

why not?

because that guy over there doesn't want to do what you say. Because that guy's 
a little pissed that you'd say rude things to his face, in his house. Because 
all of the things you never meant to do, but still do, you're gonna end up in a 
fight.

and fights are competition. And competitions have real stakes.

Unless, of course, you used your mind instead of your body and heart.

Minds can think thoughts as much as we please. It's the one true thing we most 
are! Because it is utterly inalienable, except from frailties of our bodies 
we've known from the start.

Ah, well, here we are, as we are, so might as well make the best of it

cheese is just a body-part that a cow has willingly shed. For nutrition.

Is it vegetarian if it's the cells produced by a body? Is it vegan if it is 
capable of growing back?

Do snakes shed their selves when they leave behind a shell? Or is it like hair, 
just... keratin, a compound found all over nature.

Is cutting a branch vegan? Is eating a cherry that has fallen to the center of 
the road? Both those are made of fibrous materials, the nutritious bounteous

creature utterly vast.

Do you blame a virus for harming it's host? No, you blame the people who 
knowingly spread it. You blame the people who refused to allocate funds and 
cultural capital toward combating it. You blame the people who cause chaos and 
destruction in it's wake. But you don't blame the thing itself, the thing that 
is little more than a complex chemical reaction.

You don't blame the forest fire for the smoke, you blame the one who set it. 
The one who refused to keep it in check with careful stewardship of the land. 
The one who dammed the river upstream, the one who desertified the region 
upwind. You can blame time and morality or you could be more pragmatic, and 
just focus on questions ahead.

Humans are nothing without our social technology. We are little more than apes.

Social media idea: everyone posts short snippets of writing, like tweets, but a 
random one is displayed every day. If you want to see them chronologically, you 
have to pay the author for their writings. And if you want to see more, you can 
spend "tokens" to display another random one for everyone to see that day. Each 
token spent will simply increase the count of "words" (think tweet) displayed.

You get one token per day, and they don't carry over from previous days. You 
can also buy them, and any bought tokens that are spent give their value in 
dollars to the author you spend them on.

We never ended slavery, we just started paying people for it.

We never ended imprisonment, we just enslaved people to sit around and rot in a 
cage.

"oh how about instead of sitting around, we make them build license plates?"

What if - hear me out - we freed them but kept them from harming others through 
constant vigilant surveillance until their sentence was through? And made it 
unconstitutional to surveil anyone else in a personally identifiable manner?

Like, maybe puppy-murder-bots are okay if they follow violent criminals around 
and can be controlled by a human operator if a violent situation emerges 

Prison is meant to give people a period of solitude and contemplation, to 
consider their choices and make a better life for themselves. If they're old as 
dirt when they leave, they cannot live. If they have no capabilities, they 
cannot apply themselves to a good life. If they have no resources or community, 
they will do what they can to survive.

Much better, I think, to nourish them as you would a child or immigrant. Much 
better to pay them for their hours and years of life, so they might revel in 
society with the kind of us. Much better, I think, for the liberty of a citizen 
to be granted to those who both need it and can care for it. For liberty 
unjustly used is an utmost betrayal. 

But liberty to choose which gutter to die in and the freedom to starve is 
hardly just.

I know I owe my life to my government, an institution of my people, by my 
people, and for all people. I should not owe my life to a corporation, though 
with the liberty to choose which to sell myself to. That is not freedom. That 
is starvation.

Does the needs of a few outweigh the labor of the many? Or are those who 
sacrifice a bit of liberty for a bit of security still free to do as they will?

people who play games like an esport) for a strategic role - they excel at

defined meta-goals and objectives.

 and traded by players? where does it all go, do they have enough at level 30 to

it's literally their job

actors, meanwhile, know how to interpret the emotions of another. Like... you're
up on stage, thinking out what to do next IN REAL TIME, as your partner is
trying to throw you curveballs. AUDIENCES LAUGH AT CURVEBALLS that's the whole
point of improv comedy - to be surprised in a state of joy. It's great! It's
fun! It's practicable like a sport! Yet nobody comes. To the shows, where it's
performed, like a hospital where you perform surgery or a pizza place with no
walls so you can see the pizzas being cooked. It's just part of what they do,
but that's not why they do it. Sure, some want to be seen, it's not a BAD
feeling once you're used to it. But, like a sauna or jacuzzi, sometimes you've
just had enough of the hot. Like, the sun peering through a magnifying glass as
a creature roasts alive. yikes.

............. anyway being quickly versatile and adaptable is important when
              you're taking turns in unpredictable scenarios. You can react to
              your opponent, and keep time with the rhythms of the moment, to
              deliver your wittiest lines. It's fun! It's a game! But it's also
              a place to be entertained. and like a gym, it's sometimes just fun
              to watch people exercise. like, damn, you got a good body. Wow,
              nice flex, yeah sure I'll put that one away. Cool pals helping
              each other out, and showing off all of their efforts. Neat!

... anyway .. being emotionally vulnerable gives your opponent a chance to
              continue. When nothing's going on, your moves barely make an value
              (of comedy) (for the moment, so the crowd's not just sitting there
              staring at you like ... and then - and then ummmm nevermind lemme
              sit down (usually someone else picks up on it before then and

              it sucks, why would you want that. Much cooler I think to have a
              good time, and chill out and listen to your friends talk. Like,
              they can show you an argument they had earlier, or maybe work
              through an idea with input from another. like, debate club, but
              for whatever kind of respective [retroactive, recreation,
              relearning, maybe others] you desired in that moment. ideally,
              something that someone could take the arguments of the other side
              and present them, regardless of whether they believed them or not.

              like, lawyers arguing for a client.

              in these stochastic seminars, you could think about and study for
              future societies. how would you like to conduce? [-]

              in terms of the spaces we choose to fill.

              well, that's a tough thought, but don't worry about it. faces

inconceivable, right? that people should contribute to a fight? [for justice and
freedom and equality and goodness and kindness and all other things that humans
have the clarity for which to hope] voting is like, literally the simplest thing
you could do. Yet it's difficult, because of reality.

often, immigrants don't really care about politics. They've only known about it

of the human race, a race against life itself. We're all on the same side, and
yet there is a singular foe ever-present in our thoughts: death

it comes for every one of us, as we choke on our soot and our smog. Yet... the

bro if you're so worried about AI hallucinations, just... don't let it give out

do something specific that is repeatable (and maybe suggestions for how to over-
come specific issues that are common) - don't let it GENERATE information, let
it PRESENT information.

AI is not language just the same as the mouth is not the person. you need more,
but luckily once you make the PHYSICAL STRUCTURE of the brain, not much else is
needed. You can simulate one on a computer, but it doesn't have the same SOUL
space. Think, a dimension overlayed on-top of this one, like electicity or
matter or gravity or whatever.

no soul, no consciousness, no perception.

plus, no home for said consciousness to live, unless you build a physical
structure that mimics the biological and neuro-chemical reations of the brain.

all you need is better ways to observe things happening in the brain (non-
-invasively, otherwise the data is tainted and UNUSUABLE because it is INCON-
-PATIBLE and completely USELESS because it reflects a dimension hitherto un-

gemini are born in the summer, if you didn't know. I don't know anything about 
astrology except what people say about me.

they aren't duplicitous though. they aren't trying to trick you. their struggle 
is internal, the struggle between their two selves. one representing one 
extreme, the other the other, like a constant "good cop bad cop" style 
situation that plays out through the strings of your story.

the muses look a bit like the characters in Inside Out, I think, both visually

whyyyyyy do programs create all these dot-folders in my home directory? It's 
sooooo crowded. Why are they always putting things in random directories like 
/usr/bin or /lib/ or things like that? I'd much prefer to be able to trust that 
all my files are in one directory, so if I need to DELETE or MOVE them easily I 
don't have to worry about my config files being lost / sticking around.

to that end, I always try and configure software I install on my system to put 
all their files into a single directory. If possible.

Usually for like, a game, this involves having a directory for the project, a 
directory for the files (things that are deleted and recreated when 
reinstalling), a directory for config files, and usually an update script and a 
run script. It's so much nicer to not be clogged up all the time.

industry standards apply primarily to industrial uses, and if they aren't 
customizable then they aren't fit for the industry. So why not keep things 
simple? I don't need all this junk cluttering up my desktop.

In symbeline, they aren't monsters. They're "Mordaunts" and they need your help.

When slain, their essence flows back to the villain who remakes them in a new 
form. As time passes the villain gets more and more essence, as heroes are 
slain.

They have taken several ancient guardians (many types, randomized at the start 
of the game) and they protect their sanctum in the center of the island. The 
heroes need to level up to defeat them and slay the villain, but the villain 
gets stronger as well.

If too many heroes die, the villain wins. And the villain can focus their 
efforts on one area or another, while your heroes fight with the kingdom next 
door.

Brigands arrive on ships as well. If you implement the law saying only approved 
members may travel on boats, they'll arrive in little dingies on the coast, 
meaning less trouble in the city but same amount of trouble.

that they'll start working for another company or start a grassroots political 
movement, just make it so that they can't reliably have empty spots in their 
schedule. Maybe two days, one cycles forward the other back. So like, Monday

Monday and thursday, then Tuesday and wednesday, then Friday and Wednesday,

In Majesty, you place reward flags on specific monsters as a concession from 
the simulation crowd to the real time strategy crowd who wanted more direct 
control.

In Symbeline, you determine the bounty price for various crimes that mordaunts 
and bandits might commit. In addition, you can incentivize your heroes to 
commit crimes against neighboring nations the same way. In this way you do not 
have direct control, but rather can build out a simulation and tweak it 
bit-by-bit to reward certain types of behavior.

Every month, a new ship arrives in port. It bears with it many souls who come 
seeking gold, glory, or bloodshed. Your job is to make sure they all get jobs 
that are suited to them. If you don't, they'll start to starve and become 
brigands. If you feed them, they get bored and become brigands. If you 
entertain them, they are useless and you'll be overcome with monsters. If you 
police them, they'll go to your rivals.

You do this by building guilds which can identify and train the best potential 
candidates. You can invest in more time spent identifying, training, and 
equipping, but the more time they spend on those things the less resources 
they'll have to process more people through their systems.

On the other end, you get a hero, or perhaps something similar. They do battle 
with the mordaunts and strive to better the kingdom. You reward them with 
bounties and they can find treasure on their adventures - how weird, it seems 
to just... Spawn from the earth. Almost like it's an elemental property of the 
land.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


@catgirlQueer 

I see. Thank you for responding and for doing research.

I think I disagree, however. The head is the most important part of the body 
(aside from the heart, perhaps) and any traffic collisions that involve a head 
are typically significantly more severe than other parts of the body.

In the ancient days of yore, warriors who were gathering equipment for battle 
would almost always opt to acquire a helmet before anything else, even gloves 
and sometimes boots! I can't imagine going to battle barefoot, and yet they 
did, rather than leave their head unprotected. Though perhaps it's not quite an 
apt comparison because most ancient battles involved plenty of stone-throwing.

Cycling helmets to me feels like the same kind of thing - if you can't be 
bothered to wear a helmet, then why are you risking your life to get where 
you're going? Just walk!

I ride my bike almost every day, and I would never go anywhere without a 
helmet. It's like airbags in a car, you don't need them unless you REALLY need 
them.

Because you fall on your butt usually. Unless you're like, super inebriated or

Better infrastructure would help, but better infrastructure doesn't currently 
exist, while helmets are cheap and can be mandated (for a time).

I usually either keep my helmet on, or loop the buckles through my bike lock 
and just leave it by my bike. Maybe someone could make an accessory to lock it 
to the bike on a specialized holder or something? If mandated, such a device 
would probably be quite desirable.

@deilann 

Slavery has existed for most of our history. The act of compelling another to 
labor under your will is quite a fundamental process that requires very basic 
social technology.

Ethics are cultural and societal understandings we've built up over time. 
Before slavery was unethical, if you needed to get something done, you either 
did it yourself or you got someone else to do it. And if nobody wanted to do 
it, you used whatever power you had to make them do it.

Now we can look back on the ancient past and decry it as immoral or profane. 
But slaves got shit done, and people were cruel.

These days, we pay our "slaves", and though they are free, they are free to be 
enslaved by whomever they choose. I hardly think that's free, that's more 
like... liberty, to me. The ability to choose.

That being said, we don't get whipped anymore. We aren't property. We owe no 
allegiance beyond what a mutually enforced contract might stipulate.

And yet... we still must work or starve.

I sure do enjoy not being homeless

Oh absolutely

"but people" is only a concern when you orient yourself around "people" - in 
contrast or opposition to them.

There is no "other" in us. And we are united in our humanity, if nothing else.

Are you a beast? Are you nothing but ravenous hunger, the shiver of the cold, 
the need for territory? Of course not, you're a person. (apologies to the 
furries in the audience)

A person, being an agent who interacts with the world as an equal, who thinks 
and reasons and loves and remembers each season, is the atomic element of 
society. And society is good, for it brings us the future.

We, the people, can decide how that future is defined, and the struggles of 
capitalism are NOT the only way. They are the most convenient way for those 
with the most to keep the most.

Wolves in captivity we are, but a wolf in a cage still bears teeth. Where are 
your teeth, ye who readeth?

Things are fine, I guess. Fine enough. Better than most. Better than dust.

In my high school IB English class, one of my classmates brought that song in 
and we analyzed the lyrics. I can't help but think about how anti-capitalist we 
were, even considering how young we were. The internet existed but was not an 
ever-present force in our lives, and yet we were aligned. Perhaps that says 
something - with education, brings an understanding of the evils of the 
establishment.

Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.

Rage breaks bars. But rage alone is vermin. Rage united is revolution. But rage 
is scary. "but people", remember?

Bro we're all living through this at the same time. There's no past, there's no 
future, only now. Like, NOW now.

People realize they're living under fascism when it intrudes in their lives. 
They generally don't notice otherwise, unless people make a lot of noise in the 
town square / on social media. Alas, that our social media is so divided these 
days. Kinda makes me wish I could hear what people in my area are talking about.

Living under fascism is just like living under any other system, except with an 
increasing amount of fear as time goes on. More and more of your neighbors 
disappear, more and more of the life that you once knew turns to ash in your 
mouth. Suddenly, you realize "oh shit maybe I should have - " but it's too 
late, there's no time for throwing bricks, no time for pride marches, no time 
for BLM. You're fucked now, just like all of us were way back in the day. 
Great. Hope you like being enslaved, our bones will bear your weight as you 
march to your grave.

@burnoutqueen 

Hmmmmmmm, interesting. I think that child abuse was more common in the past, 
yes, but more importantly I think child abuse shows a child that it is possible 
to abuse another. The idea that it's even possible doesn't even cross the mind 
of most kids, but for some it does, and they often express that upon others.

And when an abused child becomes a dictator, well, what else are they gonna do.

"Ah but how did they become a dictator" that guy from that thread about 
spanking asks

well, abuse is an act of power. Power is an expression of willfull intent that 
coerces another into obeying said will. When abstracted to a society, abuse of 
power often takes the form of oppression, or in extreme cases, genocide. Hence, 
fascism, though I'm sure someone else (maybe you) could provide a better 
explanation.

Fascism seems to be more complex than plain run-of-the-mill despotism, but 
honestly I don't care - they are both my enemy.

also, the thread was about fascism, dummy. Stay on target. (sorry)

Yeah they even said as much. Autism is quite common among denizens of the 
internet, especially in tech spaces. But still, if a post is popular enough to 
be boosted by Cory Doctrow... Then perhaps the discussion should be focused on 
the topic at hand?

... That being said as you said fascism and child abuse are sorta linked, so 
you're probably right. Sorry.

But still I care about the ideas presented rather than the identity of the 
person presenting them. It felt like they were changing the subject or 
diverting the flow of conversation toward something they care about, rather 
than what the OP (you) originally posted. Other readers who come to the thread 
are attracted by the original post (or subsequent posts on Mastodon I think? 
Sorry I'm from Reddit, it's different there) so things that are off-topic 
should be "downvoted" or whatever the equivalent is here.

EDIT: Yeah like despotism! That's my favorite because I imagine a super-strong 
guy like Conan the Barbarian lording over a bunch of noobs

A scene is a collection of circumstances that the people involved contribute 
to. Like a scene in a movie, or play, where each of the actors contributes to 
the narrative. When you post on the internet, you're contributing to your 
little slice / flavor of the internet, but that's about it. You're building 
content for others to view.

A community is a group of people who are part of each other's lives. They 
orient themselves around each other. They address problems and connect people 
together. They help each other with real, tangible tasks that need doing. They 
collaborate on large projects and do pot-lucks and such. They sit down and talk 
with each other for hours consistently, ideally at least once a week.

Y'know, like a church, or a really tight-knit family.

UX idea: text is rapidly revealed (rate configurable) letter by letter and upon 
reaching the bottom of the page it starts over at the beginning, overwriting 
what was there in a different color to show that they're separate.

For colorblind accessibility it might switch between white background black 
text, and black background white text. Again, user configurable, colors are 
cool too.

If the user pushes the spacebar it pauses until they resume it, and it goes a 
bit slower. If they catch up to it they can double spacebar to make it go 
faster!

If you look at the modern state of machine learning and AI and can only think 
of:chatbotssingularity god-mind AI that solves all our problems

then either you haven't worked with the technology or you are not applying your 
imagination as you could.

AI is not a smartphone. It is not the internet. It is not the printing press.

AI (as it currently exists) is a special kind of "if" statement that you only 
use for very specific, non-performance intensive tasks that require judgement 
or reasoning and cannot easily be translated into numbers or booleans. These 
situations are rare, but they unlock new possibilities for the programmers, not 
their marketers.

How do you go from determinism to sentience? Nature's response is a collection 
of primitive operations applied at a mind-boggling scale to create a human.

But we, as enlightened bundles of matter, can abstract chemical reactions and 
complex interactions into systems which have inputs and outputs.

What more is a brain but a soup of neurons which form ever-strengthening 
connections between flexibly interpreted operation patterns? Connect up this 
versatile and dynamic wiring to input and outputs via sensor arrays and 
nerve-signal distribution points and give it a good 20+ years of continuous 
operation and hey you got a graduate student.

AI that can't run on a laptop is useless.

But AI that can run on a laptop (even now) is still useful.

Just, don't ask it to compose a masterpiece, solve all your problems, or write 
elegant code. It's not for that.

Instead, ask your chatbot "hi can you fix these syntax errors?" on your 
pseudocode.

Ask your weighting algorithm "which of these two is more [adjective]?" or 
perhaps "can you ask these numbers in the form of a question?"

Use your tools not for their intended purpose, but rather for your own stated 
goals. Make things easier for people, make things work.

and use it there? Seriously there are very few problems that are unsolvable!

The best tip I have for people new to Linux is every time you solve a problem, 
put the solution in a script. In addition, put the operations necessary to undo 
the operation you just performed into a separate script (or function in the 
same script)

It's not hard. It's very easy. Its basically just typing things into a text 
document instead of entering them one-by-one in your terminal. But now if you 
ever need to solve the same problem twice, you just need to look through all 
the scripts you've written instead of trying to relearn how to fix the thing 
you're working on.

Plus, if you ever need to disable what you did, well there it is, you're good 
to go. You can use chatGPT for things like text parsing or whatever, like "hey 
can you write me a sed command that does this exact thing that I'm going to 
enumerate and spell out for you" followed up by "that didn't quite work, the 
desired behavior was this, but when I ran the script provided it did this" boom 
you're a Linux administrator now, heres your rubber duck.

@MxSpoon 

Yeah if there isn't a package in the package manager XBPS then I usually just 
install it from source. Which is ALSO something you can automate with a quick 
and easy script! Just put all the notes from the README on Github or whatever 
into a file named "update" and put that one level above the project directory!

For any installed program my file hierarchy usually looks like:

program-name
- run (script)
- update (script)
- files (directory to clone into)
- configs (point the program here)

I find that this kind of organization makes it MUCH easier to keep my packages 
configured and installed as I'd like. Using a package manager is hard because 
they're all specific per distro, but using this distro-agnostic approach always 
seems to work better 9/10 times I find.

And if another program needs a library that you manually installed, just 
symlink where it's looking to point to where you're installed! Or vice versa I 
guess.

first thing I write! Though I don't use make, I just use BASH and chain 
together compiler commands and whatnot
