@raeaw 

also "your neighbors" could mean people in your general area. It doesn't have 
to be explicitly people who live in your building or the one nextdoor.

Networking professionally can also be a decent substitute. Visiting churches or 
D&D groups or hiking groups or whatever can also work.

I love writing installation scripts like this!

If you want to install something on Linux but you have difficulty, talk to me 
and I'll write you a script like this. I might even make it fancier.

This one installs a programming language that is useful for parallel computing 
across multiple clusters of computers which could be useful if you want to 
leverage multiple CPUs and GPUs with ease to compute tasks which are far beyond 
a normal computer.

itself

time marches forward, and culture changes to no longer fit the old tools quite 
right. Plus they look like PS1 graphics ewwwwww look at those muddy textures 
and blocky bits arranged into triangles and meshes! how dorky, how retro

If you want to clean your room, try pushing everything loose into a pile in the 
center. Then, sit down next to it and sort things into piles.

"here's a pen pile, here's a paper pile, here's a rubber band pile, here's a 
trash pile" etc etc. Then, when you can't reach anything more or the piles are 
too large, find a spot for them in the bookcase or drawer or wherever.

If you can't, then reorganize. If you still can't, then pick things to get rid 
of.

It depends on the size of the file, copying a thousand lines of config file 
probably isn't that big of a deal, but copying a million lines in a log file 
just to pass it as an argument to... pad it to the left, or whatever, that'll 
DEFINITELY slow down your execution speed!

Much better to pass by reference, usually...

@jamey 

cool! my tip is to walk down the aisles and look at at least one book per aisle 
- whichever you feel called to, don't question it too much. Then just grab 
whichever one you're most interested in learning more about and BOOK IT out of 
the store before they can tackle you to the ground while yelling "STOP THIEF"

if you're lucky there'll be an old grandma in the background crying and maybe a 
kid saying "mommy why are they tackling that poor person" and the mom will say 
"hush now this kind of thing happens, say would you like some icecream?" and 
before you know it they're down the street and out of earshot just as the 
handcuffs clink into place. Unfortunately you'll forever be banned from that 
bookstore and you'll never know what secrets were held within those pages, but 
at least you'll have some shiny new bracelets, if only for a time.

low key kinda surprised they haven't made an animated robot friend that

though I kinda get why, because setting up the context is the expensive part

I had a dream about "what if people listened to me" and it was a melancholy 
kind of sad, the kind that comes after a great tribulation as one picks up the 
pieces.

Food is so important, people grow tired of the same thing every day. They say 
an army marches on its stomach, and our stomachs these days are accustomed to 
variety, taste, and plenty.

It would get better, give it time, and in time our wounds would heal. But 
wouldn't you rather persist in this timeline, the one that isn't doomed, and 
instead flourish in the ways inertia brings us? Capitalism must fall, of 
course, but it will fall of its own accord after we've done our best to 
maintain the world we live in.

"better to be starting from scratch, than lose your path"

... Yeah, okay, true, but just like justice is its own reward, so too is 
hardship it's own burden.

*you can't eat justice* 

No, but at least you aren't enslaving anyone.

*they would be slaves still, without your patronage* 

Liberation for all comes later, I guess. First up is building a safe and stable 
home for us.

*safe and stable... Like the one you have now? Like the kind the Democrats 
promise?* 

Yes, but ideological purity calls me to believe that slavery should not be 
accepted. It should not be something we condone. And yet they do, albeit 
indirectly, and so I am perplexed.

*if you want good food, live in the country. Hence why all the suburbs are 
empty.*

A wherewolf and a human stumble into a bedroom in the dark of night, their arms 
clutching each other as they make out in front of the window.

Just then, the moonlight appears, and the wherewolf's form begins to shift, as 
strangled cries turn into a cacophanous mess.

The moment passes, and the wherewolf collapses onto the bed, exhausted.

He rests there on his back for precious moments, before throwing himself to his 
feet and putting on his socks and sandals.

Ha glances in the mirror.

He straightens his tie.

He goes to fucking work, again, just as the laundry dings.

When he gets back, it smells musty, so he washes it again with bleach.

*exhaustion cares not for form, only exertion.* 

The wolf collapses once more into bed, tired from a day of accounting. He 
thinks to turn on the TV, but he slips away before getting the strength to rise 
for the remote.

In his dreams, there are children clutching at his skirt with big bright eyes 
begging him not to sleep. Not to dream. Not to feed. He brushes them aside as 
he always does, and fixes her makeup in the mirror. She glances back at them, 
quivering on the bed like a bear, a shark, a dinosaur, before she sweeps to her 
feet and goes out for a night on the streets, looking for a bar and a stranger 
to meat.

The moon once more reaches it's zenith. He is awoken with a pang of humanity as 
his hunger transforms him back into an ape with lust in her eyes.

if you're running for office we should train an LLM on your social media posts 
and let people talk to it to see if you're actually a psycho in disguise.

it's just statistics

you can't fool statistics

Then we should give you a chance to explain yourself and how you've learned 
from your most cringey mistakes. It'd also give you an opportunity to reify 
your principles and stand fast to the things people disagree with you on.

and if that sounds a little too dystopian, then maybe we could just have the 
LLMs debate each other and continue outputting text until they actually say 
something conclusive. Then throw it through a sanitized, general LLM which 
strips out all the trumpisms and fluff (with the original of course available 
for viewing)

notice I said we should TRAIN an LLM on your data, not pass it into an existing 
LLM. That way there'd be no outside biases.

If there isnt enough data then... maybe you can have a hot-seat rapid 
back-and-forth session or three to clarify your positions on things.

It's similar but it's not the saaaaame... Plus it's only one color I think. And

Maybe we can find some kind of bacteria that can be genetically engineered to

they interact it'll produce light indefinitely.

Growing up, I started with 3 video games - Super Mario Deluxe, Dragon Warrior 
1&2, and Asteroids. For the gameboy color. Then, a year or two later (what felt 
like forever), Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

Classics. I was so lucky. Not because it was more expensive than my peers, but 
because I had the right games.

Others joined later, Tetris, Mario Kart, Star Fox, etc... But having so few 
that were so good for so long made me adore them. I would play for about an 
hour a day, any more would cut into my imaginative play-time.

I did not dream of games. But I craved their moments.

These days, I play games for so long that I dream of them. In my most 
vulnerable moments I treat them like my baseline state, rather than a 
prescribed appointment of delight.

I miss wandering around without thinking of my objective. The games seemed to 
change, rather than progress. They felt alive to me. I never beat them, because 
I didn't need to.

I'll raise my kids the same way, if I ever having any...

to click on a picture, click the "view on PC" button, and then open up their
