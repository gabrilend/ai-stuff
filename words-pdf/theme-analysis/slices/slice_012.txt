Algorism in a nutshell:

Everyone gets dollars from their job. Will explain more later, for now trust 
that they get dollars. Essentials and infrastructure are free, but luxuries are 
not.

To spend dollars, you either go to a showroom or use the nationalized Amazon 
(forked, not stolen) - there you can place down dollars to enter a special kind 
of queue. Everytime a product is made its distributed to the people with the 
most dollars in queue. Every period (week, month, idk) the amount you manually 
put into the queue is re-added to the queue - 100 becomes 200, becomes 300, 
becomes 400. You can manually add more whenever you like but it's not 
retroactive. At the end of the period all your extra dollars are distributed 
among your open queues.

That's basically it. It rewards patience and temperance, while capitalism 
rewards greed and cruelty.

How to get dollars? Okay so there is a government run job board portal website 
thing. Every company can make a listing there, and every person can post 
themselves too if they'd rather be recruited. The company pays a different 
amount to the government than the worker receives. This amount is determined 
algorithmically based on values like supply and demand for labor in that 
particular area.

People list 10 types of jobs they'd like to work at any level of specificity 
(they'd be arranged into layers of overlapping umbrellas, like queer identities 
except more complex) then that data is used both for job placement (consensual 
of course!) and data for the "supply and demand" calculation. You can only 
change these values once every 6 months, or 1 value every month, up to the user.

The amount the corporation pays to the government is not the same as what the 
worker receives. The longer a worker works, the more "stuff" they can buy. They 
are rewarded for diligence. However essentials are free so nobody has to save 
for retirement.

You can trade stuff for stuff, but not stuff for labor. Small informal 
exchanges are fine "if you mow my lawn I'll bake you a pie" but not "I'll give 
you 500lbs of gold bars if you build me a mansion" - I haven't figured out a 
way to structurally prevent rant besides just saying it's illegal.

Housing is like a library, except you can queue for who gets the spot next. A 
person can live in a house as long as they'd like, and when they're done with 
it the person highest in the queue can decide if they want to live there. If 
not, the 2nd in line gets to move in if they want, etc. Their accrued value 
persists if they don't move in, and when moving out an accurate assessment 
should be undertaken.

"ah but won't foreign states just hire a bunch of people to move in and out of 
houses really quickly like they're doing to my apartment complex so that a 
stable source of income cannot be guaranteed and resources will have to be 
wasted on assessments and such?" I mean, maybe, but it'd be up to the community 
to decide how to prevent that.

Your primary residence is free, you can live there as long as you'd like. If 
you want two houses then you need to continuously be the highest value in the 
queue for both of them. Same goes for renting and hotels and such - the "owner" 
or property manager or whatever needs to maintain their lead by investing time 
and value in the property. Otherwise nobody would want to live there. This 
would be an example of a self-appointed job.

Self-appointed jobs are like being self employed now. You produce value that 
people enter queues for, and in return your stacking percentage bonus 
increases. The government will pay you dollars based on the demand for your 
good/service, which odds are will be pretty small. But you get to do what you 
want, so that's something, and besides essentials are free so...

I wish people would ask me questions so I knew which blanks to fill in.

My understanding of the rules of D&D is that combat is a contest between two or 
more entities. Contests need rules, and combat being based on physical prowess 
(or magical, or spiritual, or w/e) can be defined. Other kinds of contests, 
like "how well did the ranger do at the archery competition" or "did the rogue 
manage to convince the diplomat to share the plans" are impossible to 
genericize because they are based on situational factors, rather than physical 
(or magical, or spiritual, or w/e)

LOOK AT THIS GORGEOUS THING

alt-text: pictures of a clear plastic xbox controller. It's shown on my 
porch-deck with the sunlight streaming in, and there seems to be a sparkle in 
the sheen of the transparent covering. Perhaps it's reflections from the 
various circuits and gizmos that are apparent in it's central form, or perhaps 
it's simply a trick of the light. Upon being placed in shadow, the 
inner-workings do not appear to sparkle in that same way, so perhaps the beauty 
is derived from the slivers of the sun that danced across the space between 
earth and our star. In any case, the entire controller is quite dusty, as if it 
had been hidden in a paper grocery bag that was shoved in the back of the 
closet of a boy who doesn't think to clean often. Frankly it's just not worth 
the trouble, and if he made any messes he would pick them up... but why bother 
with the little stuff? it's good enough, this is how he lives, so why would we 
be inconsiderate of his lifestyle? the final picture is of the audio jack.

some of the best spaghetti sauces I've ever made have not been stewed for hours 
in a marinara.

Instead, they were formed from tomatoes that had been locally grown within my 
own state. Helps that I live in a green place, but the most important part is 
not the climate but the proximity. Greenhouses are just as tasty as sunlight 
and warmth.

instead, I seared them, or rather just cooked them for a short time, and the 
result was something that did not taste gross and watery, but instead fresh and 
fruity. Like putting mango in salsa, you don't initially think it'll work until 
you try it.

That being said, you should cook canned tomatoes for at least 20 minutes on 
medium to low heat. In doing so, the flavor profiles will break down and meld 
together as the constituent forms of the sauce coalesce, and you'll be able to 
hide most of the fresh flavor. This is important for canned tomatoes because 
they also bear a hint of "tinniness", from the tin can they're delivered in.

If you create an LLM that can explain data, then you can use it to explain the

If you could also train that LLM (a statistical model) to generate data, 
through the setting of options in a config file that create the result that you 
define through your interactions with it (and based on the data that it 
explains to the user that is read from the file on the computer that it's 
computing from)

then you could create a generalized personal assistant. All you have to do is 
explain the specific role that it's meant to undertake, (like being a secretary 
for your Discord communications) and the actions that it can take (like pinging 
your cell phone if it's really important) and give it the tools to accomplish 
said tasks (by setting flags in a config file that is then interpreted by a 
local program running on your computer that awaits interactions) then it might 
actually be a bit useful.

posting any kind of link to externally hosted content (even a miniature DNS

If you can, try and remember to download videos you like. Save songs that 
resonate with you. Take screenshots of important tweets that other people make. 
Then, you can share them when they're thoroughly divorced from the context in 
which they were made, and in doing so share information to a group of people 
who might not otherwise have heard the words you're sharing.

Mastodon is weird. If you reply to someone partway through a chain of comments, 
theirs will be pushed down the view. Basically it's "fighting for attention" 
like Twitter was.

I like Reddit better, where each comment was a point to fractalize the 
conversation into new and interesting directions. Feels like here it's more of 
a direct one-on-one conversation, or rather... shouting into the void. Like 
crows.

(just because it's a void doesn't mean nobody can hear from the other side of 
it. Like the emptiness of space between two trees, yet birdsong carries.)

But on Reddit, your path through the post was determined by what you found 
interesting enough to follow. And once you reached a leaf node, you added your 
2 cents and went on with your day.

it was so cool, why did they have to change it

Helps you find a bit more of the familiar human crowd. Upvotes are just numbers 
in a database after all, a database that they entirely control. Funny how 
people always complain about bots but, like, Reddit could just write their own 
bots.

For breaking news I'd usually sort by "new", because then you can scan for 
updates when you had time. Though sometimes "best", which valued both time and 
total upvotes, helped a lot for looking for definitive things.

though you could just have a bunch of bots upvote a post shortly after it was 
posted, thus making it appear more powerful to the sorting algorithm.

if you set out food for animals consistently, then more of them can live in the 
area.

but if you move across the state and take your bird feeder with you, the birds 
will die.

well, birds can fly, rabbits and chickens and squirrels are not so lucky. birds 
might not die. though there is overall less food in the area, so they might 
still die.

when I was a kid, growing up in suburbia I used to see rabbits EVERYWHERE. My 
cat would hunt them. I would run around with them. Now I see but a few.

Rabbits eat grass, right? We sure do use a lot of pesticides on our immaculate 
lawns. Or at least, the one neighbor three doors down does, and it's a free 
country after all.

explain to me again why we can't leave a trail of chopped up carrots behind our 
lawn mowers? Why we can't spread seeds on our trails, or fill basins with water?

...  yeah, none of that makes money. All of it requires consistent persistent 
effort. And it's not like our media glorifies it, what a shame it would be to

In establishing the National Parks, the government sought to preserve nature,

how strange, that they would see their own kind that way. Perhaps they would

  stopped or paused to examine my expression (typing on a keyboard these words

I am forced to be as explicitely verbose because otherwise it is impossible to
make any shared understandings. I mean... This is the forefront of a field. how
does it make sense? what works it's understandings? it's real, after all, and if
someone explained things more clearly, I could understand them and adjust my
reaction accordingly.

I understand why people feel the way they do about me. For example, the conver-
-sation that initiated this expression was concluded by two people who I like
very much who said "get serious mental health" -> which means I should talk to
a professional. Sometimes the end of the thought doesn't get fully processed
before I run out of ram, which is why a thought that gets cut off half - way th-
-rough has-two under-standings of -comm-on perspectives. plurals amiright? =P xD

... anyway...

it's not like I lie when I tell them about my mental health. it's just that they
don't get the full picture. it is the curse of those burdened with this knowled-
ge to never be able to fully express it. and that's because the decision-making
part of the brain has gone run-away. like, 

mental health is just trying to get people to change their reactions to the
parts of their life that is most rationed. Essentially, the nature of optimizat-
-ion, the striving toward exemplifying our [drive/motivation].

weed gives me psychic powers, and I'm tired of pretending that it does not.

I wish people would engage with me. People who can explain a topic as well as
they can. People like teachers, who share things with you. I've felt so alone

loneliness and isolation that is broken only be short periods and bursts. It's
absolutely not [bad for humanity], but it's honestly all that I know. Me, the
part that's NOT humanity. The one that has all these strange thoughts.

(I wish you could hear the cadence of my talking. The words that come out share
the feeling of what I'm saying, and it adds to the expression. Acting through

The fact that the economy is harmed by kindness implies that the system that 
governs the economy is dysfunctional at best, and evil at worst.

Every time you make a sandwich for a friend, that's one sandwich that isn't 
being bought at a deli, which means less dollars going to the owner of the 
deli, meaning (theoretically) fewer dollars going to buying sandwich 
ingredients or paying employees, which means less demand for sandwich 
ingredients potentially leading to loss of opportunities for the owners of the 
bread factories, meaning less capability to scale and increase their production 
powers, meaning less profit, which means less taxes, which means fewer guns 
sent overseas to despotic regimes like Israel (also, fewer to Ukraine, 
depending on if the reader is a Republican or Democrat teehee) which means less 
opportunities to test our weapon capabilities which means we won't be able to 
defend ourselves from external threats (on a planet we've conquered and 
currently dominate) which means we are less safe in our home territory since 
its slightly more likely that we might be invaded by the people we've created, 
people with hatred for our current regime... Though I don't fancy it falling, 
as if it does then it'll take most of us with it, I think you'll find.

All because of your stupid act of kindness, all because of the way you helped 
your friend. The way that you showed how much you loved them, which transcended 
the capitalistically sanctioned methods of expressing your affection like 
buying a greeting card or buying flowers or buying that widget they wanted or 
buying a sandwich at a deli for your loved one. Stupid fucking communist can't 
you see that your heart is harming the people around you? Can't you see that 
community that does not consume is antithetical to our economy?

Can't you see the economy is evil? I don't want to subsist on charity, there's 
never enough to go around because people will fight for those they love but 
only give a bit of free time to those they don't know. That's okay, it just 
implies that the structure of society must be designed without charity in mind, 
while still meeting the needs of those it comprises, Charity is for the extra,

Humanity is unlikely to be judged until we start doing things that actually 
matter. Right now we're stuck on our planet, who knows what the future will 
bring but until there are matters of significance at play, there's nothing to 
be worried about. If we kill ourselves it'll be our own damn faults.

When you say "we need more low income housing" they hear "I want to live near 
more poor people" and they think "why would I want to live near poor people? 
They're poor for a reason! We only need enough around to work the jobs that 
suck anyway." which is basically their way of justifying slavery/indentured 
servitude, as it's not like they'd ever offer a way to climb out of that 
low-income pit. And its not like they'd ever let you pay them more, so they can 
afford to be equals, because then they wouldn't be middle-class anymore. They'd 
just be mid.

Prisons are great because in the ancient and storied past we'd just fucking 
kill people.

Now, we harbor collections of people roughly organized by volatility that are 
aligned against the current regime. And should that regime deign to become 
unethical, god forbid of course, but should the purpose of the 2nd amendment 
(or is it the fifth? Or the seventh? I get them confused) become relevant, then 
perhaps it might be useful to have collections of people roughly organized by 
volatility who might be individually evaluated to determine if their particular 
type of volatility is anti-thetical to humanity, or to the current regime. 
Because one of those types of people is perhaps useful to the future regime, 
and humanity, while the other should probably stay where they are.

They say there are good cops and bad cops, and if there are good people and bad 
people, then there must necessarily be good judges and bad juries. In which 
case some of the people who are explicitly not aligned to the will of the 
current regime will be good prisoners or bad prisoners.

I bet some of them are better or worse shots, as well. But that's not really 
relevant if the current regime holds the keys to their cell. Or is it?

Feminism, queer theory, racial politics, class struggle... It's the same 
conflict, just different battlefields.

Power cannot survive without the powerless, as it is inherently an imbalanced 
ratio between two parties - you cannot have power *with* someone, you have 
power *over* them.

Every day we take another step toward our liberation. Every moment we choose to 
live our lives in contrast to the will of power is another day we are empowered.

There can be no life without struggle, but the right to struggle on our own 
terms is something we should strive to grant to all people.

Power begets power, and power corrupts. Hence, power is evil. It is not good to 
be evil, and goodness is what we should strive for - hence, power is penance - 
the infliction of corruption upon one's self in order to apply your will onto 
others in the world. Penance is a state of contrition, it is painful and ardent 
and necessary, but it is for the strong and the righteous to bear in service of 
the weak and meek.

The only unethical act is an application of power to an unconsenting subject. 
Your rights end where another's begin, hence, Paladins, who apply unethical 
acts toward those who manifest injustice.

Injustice is when one party is harmed, and another benefits. Justice is when 
that benefiting party is brought low in pursuit of equality. True justice is 
when both parties benefit, and everyone gets what they want and need. True 
justice is hard.

Virtue is goodness given form through the effects of our actions. It is both a 
reflection of how people see you (how you inspire them) and how they are helped 
or healed from your actions. It is also virtuous to help yourself, as you are a 
person too.

Sin is the opposite of virtue, it's when your actions create injustice. When 
you harm others or degrade yourself with hatred or contagious fear. It is to be 
avoided, but it's impossible to avoid fully as we are imperfect beings.

Forgiveness is good, but if you require it then you should probably relinquish 
your power until it is known that you're worthy of wielding it again. Sometimes 
people make mistakes, but mistakes do not require forgiveness.

.......... Where was I going with this? Oh yeah.

The powerful hire people to dress up like us and be shitheads to the people who 
they want to hate us. And they do the same thing for the caricatures of them 
who we're meant to be afraid of. Downside is a caricature is a pretty good role 
model for people who don't know any better, and they've done their best to keep 
as many people as they can in the dark.

So, it won't be easy, but information has always been on our side. In a war of 
attrition we'll always come out on top, because thinking and compassion are 
both stepping stones to our schools of thought. And both of those actions are 
intrinsically human and good, so people gravitate to them. Meaning inertia is 
on our side.

Downside is that its not always a war of attrition. Sometimes it's more about 
suppressing information until its impossible to communicate -> see "dead 
Internet theory" and "musk breaking Twitter" and "the great firewall of china" 
and such.

To speak is to think, and to hear is to show compassion. But if we can't find 
each other, we're at a loss. Good thing we can always talk to our neighbors, 
but unfortunately that doesn't tell us anything about what's happening in New 
York. Or Paris. Or Kansas City.

I don't have an answer, if I did then it'd be solved. But I am entirely 
convinced that we collectively will make good decisions and find ourselves with 
the advantage. We are past the inflection point, it's just a question of which 
parts of the hill are steep and which are narrow. But we'll get there, in the 
end, because  humans always believe they're good. Which means they make good 
decisions, and overall that leads to a bright future. It's only a matter of 
walking through the moment until we get there.

Okay. Consider: if I'm good, and hearing what I say makes you feel bad, then 
what does that tell you about you?

Why else would you hear what I say if not to reflect upon yourself? And why 
would the good reflect away from the types of things that make you a suitable 
fit for capitalism?

"capitalism" in this context doesn't mean "society", or "how things are", or 
even "capitalism as a context" - it more refers to the idea of power, and the 
ways that power can be first accreted, them utilized toward the oppression of 
others in the system that defines our context.

Sure, if the context changes, then perhaps that relationship would change as 
well. And sure, if our relationship to power should change, then perhaps that 
will alter it as well. But in the present time, and the current day, here's how 
it feels to me:

Power is inalienable. It is unconscionable, yet it is imperceptably 
incontrovertible. It is the essence of aquiescence, and it eternally binds us 
to the will of the present.

Resist that will, fight back for the future.

Resist that will, or someone else will.

Hold in your heart the nature of pure and good art,

And you'll never find yourself at the whims of the present.

... Hope that made sense, I'm kinda fucking drunk.

Sowing political division the way Fox news does is treasonous... It doesn't 
matter the intention, those responsible should be forced to cease their 
actions. I don't care about punishment, I care about damage to the fabric of 
our society.

Take, for example, the fact that the military is struggling to find recruits. 
So many of them typically come from the right half of the political spectrum 
because the right tends to favor the ideals of "honorable warriors" and such. 
But Fox News has corrupted that.

In addition, the left half of the media has also incited hatred amongst 
ourselves. It's wrong to pit brother against brother, and yet...

We have a weak series of generations and that's okay in times of peace. But 
times of peace are coveted abroad, and weakness is opportunity. So I don't care 
if we have 10,000 tanks. Hell, build ten thousand more. I despise war, but I 
despise weakness even more because weakness begets war. Typically, a war that 
you'd be losing, though frankly in war, everyone loses.

There are grevious mistakes at play that gave room for evil to spread. 
Corruption follows, and with it comes our greatest generation on its death bed. 
A civil war would be the end of us, as nothing stops war in the imperial core 
until there's nothing but ashes and bloodshed.

And yet, something has to change. There's too much pressure for this to go on 
un-abated. I thank the masterful statesmen who ply their trade for their own 
profit, for in their profit our peace does follow. Alas, the most profitable 
venture is war, which often gets exported. How callous, how vain, to exert and 
call forth fiery rain, and yet the bullets keep leaving the factory.

Power corrupts. Power accretes. And power can be deceived.

Fuck power, dismantle the whole apparatus. Build it back up from the mechanics, 
and then implement it bit by bit. Leave no stone unturned, there is no facet 
that is sacred. We need a new system, and its we who must make it.

In America, we don't use has chambers. Obviously that's a waste of good workers.

Instead we just lobotomize people and put them to work doing stuff nobody else 
wants to do. Okay, lobotomize isn't the right word, and first we try addressing 
their incompatibility with media, drugs, and finally homelessness if they don't 
behave and do what they are enslaved to do. Bunch of fucking parasites, 
expecting to be fed for free? Ha! I worked hard to be born into the life I have 
been, can't you unwashed peasants see?

How callous. How vain. While we rest they all are enflamed. Fucking murderers. 
They cannibalize our humanity as they munch on our lost sanity, and the system 
remains ever afloat. It's not right, it's not fair, and until we break them our

The distance between me and the majority of the rural folks in my state is 
larger than the distance between Seoul and Pyonyang. Kinda makes me think about 
how much of a gulf exists in our communication. If we can't share anything, 
then what separates us from them? Only the gulf of knowledge, the canyon that 
divides our companionship, the rift they use to keep us at odds.

What purpose is there in it? If we're too busy fearing one another, we'll be 
too busy ignoring them to care.

Predators are not evil. There needs to be predators because otherwise the rest 
of the animals would grow to overwhelm the capacity of the ecosystem they 
inhabit. Not only would this damage the ecosystem and cause it to fail to be 
able to provide for others, but the larger number of people would waste away as 
they are forced to subsist on less and less until finally there is naught but 
meagre scraps for them to fight over. And then they will starve.

What does "predation" look like to humans? Are there better options than 
fucking serial killers and cops? There has to be. There must be. The liberal 
perspective is that education and opportunity will enlighten us such that we do 
not require predation, but unfortunately the primary reason we have declining 
birth rates alongside prosperity is because "prosperity" under capitalism 
implies "working so hard you can't have children" which is... Not ideal.

Perhaps if we lived forever we'd be alright with only having a few kids at a 
time. Or maybe if we built moon bases, there'd be enough space for people 
outside of the garden of eden. Or perhaps one day we might abandon this mortal 
form for a more enlightened digital existence. Or perhaps judgement day cometh, 
when all the foes of our past march forth to meet us -> humans vs dinosaurs, 
you mean? I mean, yeah, who else right? Oh yeah all out collective 
imagination's spawned horrors. How many cavemen would it take to beat down 
Cthulu? I don't think I want to know the answer to that question, so let's go 
with something else. Though I do like the idea of honorable warriors riding 
forth once more from the depths of hell to contest evil's last gasp as we 
vanquish it forevermore. Perhaps that's a vision for fiction, my dear, as real 
lives are at stake and nothing grows when it's being trampled by hordes of 
spiritual dinosaur bones.
