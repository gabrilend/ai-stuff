can we make a dark mode as well? it should use bright vivid colors, and the font
color should be the color of the poem background. However, they should follow a
similar pattern as the strokes with their black outline by printing a black
letter with 1.3x size centered specifically on each character before printing
the character with the background color. This is to improve readability. Be
aware that the kerning will probably be off, so we'll have to write each
character individually and move the cursor such that the positioning of the
inner colored letter is consistant, but the position of the outer black border
is variable and may overlap with each other.

this dark mode should be selected with a command line argument to the run script
