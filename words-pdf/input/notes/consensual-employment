why does consent exist as an idea if it isn't applied to every part of your
life? It's an ideology, a philosophy. Believe in the willing cooperation of
others, and forgive and assist when you can. You must be patient with others,
and guide them to see as you can. This is the true philosophy, the helping and
goodness in others, the trust and the faith in benevolance. It's not just a 
game, or simply a phase, it is focused intentional futures. Being good is an
effect, of concentrations of that, current of sequence of conclusions. The
public consciousness (the communal meme-o-sphere) is a living breathing entity
just as we are. It inhales with the tides, as news articles and stories, the
viewer and receiver of knowledge. There's but a screen, between you and 'tween
me, it's the same cooperative engagement. What's happening to me, is just part
of being decieved, and who is our most challenging rival? Only ourselves, who is
perfectly adapted to help, and without whom we wouldn't have futures.

Not compulsion, but a relationship. Together we stand, and strive toward the
future, compassionate and supportive together. United we stand, and I cherish
the brand, that lives on and through us via our actions. We represent who we be,
and comprisedually you see, that nothings as fearsome as children. We keep it
from ye.

Elon Musk buying Twitter is just an example of the power rich people have. When
someone doesn't like what they're doing, they can just be bought up by a single
person. No single person should deserve that much power - it must be decided by
a community. We have to work together on things that truly matter, and not by
organizing according to the whims of those who are best.

If it's really true, that the spirit of capitalism is correct, then answer me
this - why is it better? What about the individualized experience is so
important? Can we not agree to ourselves, and be brothers and pals?

No, because you see - life is defined by the relationship between you and me,
like how flowers are needed by the stars.

What if there's no planets? What if Earth is unique because it was in a solar
system? What if "dark matter" doesn't exist, and it's actually islands? How
then, does gravity work,

the rich aren't the best. They're the luckiest. They won the genetic lottery,
and so are considered more "valuable" somehow. How is that fair? How is that
desired? Shouldn't we reward those who do well, and praise those who are chill?
Like less "good vs evil" and more "who we want to be". Seems to me that if you
are relaxed as hell, and friendly and not foul, then why not keep you around?
we're all working here, on a communal project - the greatest of projects, that
which is humanity. Society! Culture, appraisals and our futures! We love to
exist, and the rules which must be betwixt, our fellows and customers compel us.

time for sleep.
