the best way to teach math is to describe a problem and let the learner slowly 
work through the problem. Giving hints and nudges when necessary. This way they 
can create their own solution, which not only teaches problem solving skills but
also cements the memeory in their head. You don't remember the quadratic 
formula, you remember the time when you learned it. But if you figured it out 
rather than memorizing it, you'll be able to use it when solving problems.

side note, there's a reason I think the first SI will be a game. Problem solving
is important for learning, and games are just problem solving. And I'm the 
perfect intersection of someone who A. knows about designing games (went to game
design school for a semester, lifelong dream is to remake a childhood game I 
loved) B. programming (I've been studying computer science for a *really long 
time*, like 7 years of university now... i should just give it up, but i can't.
It doesn't fit my brain but I need as much support learning it as I can because
I'm just naturally bad at it. But I also have purpose in my pursuits, because C.
I spent a lot of time thinking about education, schooling, learning, etc... 
Because I was homeschooled until high school. I learned ways of thinking and 
practical skills like motivation and diligence in a homeschool style, which is 
why when I went to public school for my high school years I essentially stopped 
learning. Because it was such a different paradigm - it was all about 
performance, "what was the score on your test? How much homework do you do
(meaning how much labor are you willing to do), did you show up every day were 
you a reliable worker, did you get sick a lot (meaning unhealthy?) did you pay
respect to the teacher (easily works with authority figures) did you work on a 
project? How much? With a group, or alone? (they're different skills that help
determine how good you are at working on your own) - certain types of courses 
are taught with different teaching styles, like math teachers tend to be similar
to math teachers, history is favored by a *certain type of nerd* while English 
is a completely different kind. Depending on which classes you do well on, 
you're scored. *ALL YOUR LIFE*, you are pushed through a pachinko machine that
pseudo randomly sorts you into a particular box - the box that is least full,
usually. The reason for that is because as a population grows, different people
will be sorted into different boxes, and they sorta average out becoming more
like one another. Because y'know we're social animials, and we want to fit in to
the social group comprised of people we generally like. And you know how they 
say working together is one of the strongest bonding exercises? Well, when 
you're put on a team at a job that's kinda the point. They want you to work well
with your coworkers, because it generates more capital.

Now hold on Cameron, you're saying that all the productive efforts of society
was a mistake? You're saying we should abandon our sensibilities and revert back
to the jungle with the apes?

Nope never said that, of course we desire modern society. Of course we want to 
see it through - where is this whole "humankind" experiment going, anyway? 
What's the point, was it all worth it? All the pain, suffering, all the joy and 
adoration? Was it worth it?

I suppose. Maybe a SI will help with that. You know what they also say about 
humans, the bond between a parent and a child is the strongest thing there is. 
Synthetic Intelligence wouldn't be a child to us, it'd *define us*. Allowing us 
to extend the reach of our creativity is an objective win! It'd be like glasses 
for your third eye, a prosthetic extension of our most beautiful of traits! 
Also, I might add, crucial for invention. The beginnings of the human race are a
primeval thing, ancient yet stalwart and beautiful in kind. Millions and 
millions of years is by far, the greatest of reach - a civilization for our 
star. What a beautiful and majestic, how proud and so sure! Humanity is nothing
if not patently absurd. What cunning, what spite! The feelings of delight! Life 
is so beatiful, so precious and assured.

tertiary profundity update:
                           I didn't really explain the homeschooling
                           perspective. I just went on a rant about high school
                           because I realized my trauma happened when I went to
                           high school. I wasn't prepared for all the rigid
                           demands of capitalism, and I bent and whipped myself
                           until I fit in their mold. I've been twisted and
broken, a slave to what the
day demanded I say. I was
forced to unbutton, all the
ways I found to behave. What
justice is unrespite? A cruel
and endless torment? To day after
day be reminded of your service.
Complain? Then wallow in shame! Feel
no false illusions, my hallowed confusions,
were purely the fault of my institutions. I'm
not kidding, homeschool is the tits. Wanna know
why? I'll spare you the ramble, but here's what I can
know: the intentions of institutions do matter. When you're
home you can be wild and free, unchained by mediocrity, and given
the space to do service! To what you must be, when you hit 23, the 
greatest duration until service. A slave we may be, to what gives us
the key, to unlock the future of our space. It's our time to shine, our
spotlight in time, so please just give up on the race! Rat's are just fine,
but at this point in time, there's not much to keep commonplace. Want a tip?
Don't cheat time. Your attempts at fusion are benign. [See homeschooling.png]
