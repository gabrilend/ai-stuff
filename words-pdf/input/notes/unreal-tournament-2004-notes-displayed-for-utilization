capture the flag
map with lanes (you'll see)
also was included with the demo of the game back when it was released
which implies that the developers thought it was one of the best maps
(at least, the one that best showcased the gameplay style of the full game)
they let you host multiplayer servers too, which was cool
just with the demo
for free
but like... only 3 or 4 maps
(I forget how many)

also no mods, which was half of the appeal

I like to play in a way that is non-standard

because I believe it shows the most dense formations of combatants

(the bots can be kinda dumb)

so I put them on "experienced"

be careful not to hurt your allies (hundred percent)

scary! D: D:

regular :)

you can create your own "mutators" by the way
(just some C++ code, run in their environment, so no need to mess with compilers
)

3 paths to your enemy


omg :O :O


that's one style of play
pushing forward
consistently

but check out this other style that is *also* pushing forward consistently

adrenaline makes you bonused

hey we got a point :D

told ya boosters gave ya bonuses

anyway I just played this map
and couldn't wait to show it to you
so let's try a different one
(because I've already played this one for 31 minutes now
