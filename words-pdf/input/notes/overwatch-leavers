If you leave an Overwatch game right as it's ending, or rather once
you know you've lost, then you're missing a core part of the gameplay
and this absence could be leading to toxic behavior or maladjusted
feelings surrounding the game.

Essentially, if your investment is in a single round - a single match,
then you'll lose interest once it's apparent you're going to lose.
Viewing a single match / round as the required data points is
basically only testing / improving your mechanics.

the crucial missing element is the opportunity to *update* your plan.

If you only play against an enemy once, you aren't gaining any new
data - which is why second chances are so important.

This is why comp is the only real game mode in Overwatch. Everything
else is just setting you up to feel bad - losses are your fault, and
wins are unpredictable and give dopamine spikes. In comp though? It's
the opposite - losses are the *team's* fault, wins are obvious and can
be understood if you analyze them, and the dopamine is spread out over
a much larger period of time. The end result is a feeling of
companionship, short term planning skills, and the same mechanical
skills that you would have gained from playing quick play. In fact, the
only game mode that has trains skills that are transferrable *outside*
of Overwatch is comp. Fuck quick play.
