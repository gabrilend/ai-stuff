the flaw with open source software is also it's greatest strength.
it is open, so it can be observed by practically unlimited perspectives.

however, it lacks follow-through. a larger, more concerted effort, can often
bring greater and more efficient results.

the trick is in the balancing, and ideally you'll never falter -
but it's best when you all get along.

new ideas, new frames of mind, and more of us kept together.
if one splinters off, the rest are at fault,

and you don't want to lose your finger

so why fight at all? why not focus on our own times? and then together we are
one

in sight of our homes, is when we're most alarmed, because houses are not for
your homeless

yet together they might
have strength for the fight
that ever bears down on our shoulders

There was something else, but I can't remember. Something about open source
    software that was important enough to get me to write this note. Somewhere
    along the first line I lost it, or rather felt I needed more context, and
    then when the context was finished the original intent was lost. It's hard
    because when I go for the conclusion first and justify it with context,
    then the conclusion doesn't make sense and the context meanders. I'll try
    harder next time. These notes are my life's work.
