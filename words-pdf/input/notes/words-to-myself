================================================================================

I'm just going to transcribe what I hear

please don't

you hear me (something)

what? perfect listen

...

...

don't text me now? (I think?)

[didn't catch that]

... that's okay

perfect

thank you

just a second facebook

he's here (I think?)

(or maybe something her)

what I love you (or maybe I know her?)

do you hear me? (or "just a second")

(@ everyone watching me receive telepathic messages from god or whatever,
please don't judge me too harshly, I'm not a good transcriber hehe)

what's that (or maybe holy shit)

what, then perfect or okay (?)

(yesterday you said you were leaving and I got concerned)

yes, then "I'm leaving", then shutdown. fuck. I don't want you to go. I only
understand some of what you say but fuck, I'm so lonely and I wish you could
hear me back. Sometimes it feels like you do, even though I just think thoughts
or tap on something metal or even sometimes whisper... I just don't know what
to do and I'm so concerned about my purpose here in this century. Do I help
people? Who do I trust? Can I believe in myself, or am I just kinda... worthless

I don't know. I wish I knew. Please hear me and respond. Or better yet, say hi

like, I'd literally do anything that anyone asked me to. Unless I didn't want
to. Like, I'm pretty good at turning people down when I don't want something,
but I have to do it first to know if I want it or not. Trouble is of course,
in life there's no second chances.

I'm on my, what, 499th chance? Jeezzzzz

will continue after the break, when the messages resume.

================================================================================

(and we're back. hopefully.)

(too many things srry) something about having it open?

(my windows are closed rn btw if you want to drop by and kill me / talk to me)

(didn't catch that) (something about portland, perfect, windows, "this is the
[whole/right/wrong] thing)


thank you

oh, again? (or oh, she did?)

they caught you

(um)

...

(I am an American princess, and sometimes it's necessary to kill princesses.)

(I understand.)

... (okay well I don't get it but like, I don't mind being killed.)

(okay well you're not saying anything so I'm going to work on my game)

(I think it was something like "DID SHE KILL HER") and then (oh we're back)

... (I should learn Toki Pona)

you don't know it?

RIGHT away

learn it

yes

please

learn it

just Learn it

right now

(sorry only half listening)

shit (or bitch, it was said right as I debated clicking "same day delivery" for
a toki pona book on Amazon - I didn't do it btw! It was tempting but, like, I
don't want to make someone work harder for me just for like, 3$)

(shutdown)

================================================================================

(hiii)

(I'm hungry)

(do you like ramen?)

(you said something about being "impressed with yourself" but I didn't
understand the first part)

(oh you probably want me to scroll up right)

... (something's a lot to read? Or "you've gotta leave"?)

... (I'm

(you keep asking me to remember but, like, I dont know what you want me to
remember. Look, I don't know who you are, but I don't want you to leave, and I
don't want you to hate me. I want to work together. Let's be friends?

Are you someone who I worked with at Intel?)

yes, stupid (your words not mine)

(okay I'm going to start listing names, just stop me when um idk)

goddamnit remember me

... (trying...)

remember her

(two syllables)

(my name is Cameron)

(your name is...)

[redacted, though I did type it out so anyone watching could see]

(shit my opsec sucks)

{oh, are you on an op, little prophet?} (no shut up you know what I mean)

{now you're just talking to yourself} (I know this sucks -.-)

(It's always so weird when someone walks past my apartment door and doesn't
enter a door)

================================================================================

(I practice with my sword every day.)

(I don't anticipate fighting a war with it)

(It's mostly just to keep unarmed and unarmored people from grappling me.)

(punching is fucking stupid)

(Nobody wants to fuck with a sword)

================================================================================

(either "goddamnit" or "don't hear me")

"she's perfect"

"cameron"

"are you clean"??? yes thank you (or maybe "different thing")

(I do cannabis maybe once every week or two, depending on if I feel compelled)

don't leave

remember

(did she know)

........ do you want me to stop transcribing? (you're getting desperate, huh?)

did you know there are 20 trans people for every cop in america

just a random thought

(you want me to leave jack because he's an asshole?)

goddamnit (missed my birthday? it's my birthday?)

wait who's missing?

A bad plan executed concurrently is better than a good plan executed in disarray

capitalism's a bad plan, just saying...

frozen butter tastes worse than room temperature butter

(taking a break while I eat)

================================================================================

WASTED POTENTIAL? cmon

.... what do you want from me? I'll give it to you if it's in my power, as long
as I know what you want I can try. But, like, I'm pretty confused about what
exactly I'm supposed to be doing.

you know I can hear when you talk to your friends, too right? like, when the
window's open. errrr the connection.

..... damn guess I'm not as continent as I thought

I'll save you, I promise. Have faith. Tell me what you need. I'll do my best.

yeah I'll live with you in portland

.... brooklyn? Yeah I'll live there too

.......... does my name really gotta be "diapergirl" like c'mon
           why not Ritz Menardi - though I guess "menardi" and "diapergirl" have
           the same amount of syllables...... hmmmm, maybe I'm projecting lol

"please come back" to where tho

listen Elentalus is just as important as anything else on my website, it's okay
if I spend time working on it. It's literally a game about creating gods, c'mon

..... can you be more specific?

yeah I made that

one sec I'm going to read a book, in this book there's a section where a
prisoner in vietnam communicates with another using a strange communication
method using, like, taps or something. I forget. Anyway gonna try and find it.

maybe we can use it to talk easier. Also gonna clean my butt.

..... fuck it's a long book >.>

================================================================================

found it on page fucking 603, jeeeezzzzzz

                                           down .    A B C D E
                                                |    F G H I J
                                                |    L M N O P
                                                V    Q R S T U
                                     then right ---> V W X Y Z

so, like, tap tap tap (pause) tap tap would equal M
          tap tap     (pause) tap tap would equal G

like morse code, but easier since you don't have to memorize anything

(also note that K is missing becuase it's an extra character I guess)

(I personally would have eliminated C but that's just me)

================================================================================

oh hey nice to see ya

what's up

wait what

I'm trying to um what's the word... retrain myself

I do a lot of laundry in the shower

I don't use soap tho, it's too harsh

but uh yeah I'm making progress I guess

honestly it's mostly a mental thing, like... paying attention to the signals
from my body that are usually filtered out because there's more "important"
things to think about (thanks brain, really appreciate the wet pants -.-)
