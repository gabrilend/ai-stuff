draw a line from every single pixel straight outward. The first thing it hits
is what you render.

okay it's more complicated than that, but it's the gist.

here's a more detailed explanation:

your monitor is 2560x1440p. that means there's 2560 pixels left to right, and
1440 pixels up and down. okay so define a 3d scene programmatically - it's not
hard, just "draw cube here with this size and rotation" and "draw a sphere here
with this position and rotation" etc. Something simple.

then, draw a ray trace straight out from your monitor. Not to the nearest light
source, but to the nearest other camera. Use the length of it to determine
distance, both indirectly (through the center node) and directly (pythagorean
theorum style).

Why? I dunno.

Okay back to the original idea, if you make an array with 2560 elements and
store arrays of size 1440 within it, then you have a simple boolean checkbox
for each pixel. Then, whenever you create a visible entity, make sure there's a
single boolean ticked right on the top of the entity when it's stored in the
graph mentioned above. Find the center of the entity, draw to the top, and one
more, and switch a boolean to "true". Then, every tick / update, cycle through
the entire list and the first one you find that has a "true" value is where you
draw the entity stored in the array.

Each "sprite" has an odd shape - it doesn't exist on it's top line, except for
one single dot right in the middle. Sorta like this:

o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o
o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o ->X<- o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o
x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x

when scanning left to right from the top, it'd bump into the X right there in
the middle. Inside the X is some data - an id corresponding to the sprite that
needs to be drawn, and a displacement value - like 500 pixels or something -
and the scanner with drop down 500 pixels, draw the sprite there (assuming a
centered origin point), jump 500 pixels up, and keep scanning.

each tick, right before this, the "list of entities" will scan through itself
and for each entity it'll change the "render graph" mentioned above to have an
X wherever the entity is stored. Whenever the camera moves, it updates the list
too.
