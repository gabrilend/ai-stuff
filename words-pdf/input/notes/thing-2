one of my favorite things to do is play overwatch

nerf blast arena is fun, but not the same. different kind of fun. actually fun.
overwatch was... practice, for different ways of thinking

I liked to play Tracer and always put my distant target behind my main target.
that way I was applying pressure to the frontline while also chipping away at a
potential loop-around target. Always looking for angles on low-health-targets,
while firing their pistols as often as they can.

when playing as Mercy, I would do the same but inversed.
I'd put my frontline between me and between the dps foes.
usually, try and put my tank on-top of their dps, and put their tanks in firing
range (but distant enough to not deal too much damage) (give space)

have you ever heard of the kingdom of luminar?

it was an ancient naaru (spirit)

a moment of clarification in an eternal, pitiless dark.

            contemplation.
