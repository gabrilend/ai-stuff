ecologists don't want to play games like Wingspan. It's just a card game with
some window dressings that make it feel like birds. What they really want
(what they need)
is something that lets them simulate environmental situations. Like, for
example, the bog behind my house.

I live in an apartment complex. Inside this complex there is a pond. Inside this
pond there is a fountain, and inside the fountain is a mechanism that regulates
how much water to push out the spigots of the fountain. However, the mechanism
is prone to breakage. It often goes out of commission, causing the water to
have an unregulated spray! To combat this the property managers turn off the
source of water, so that in essence the fountain is functionless. During the
repair process, the forests of Oregon begin to creep in. There forms a green
sort of ooze that rests on the surface, and birds like ducks and storks or
herons or w/e the fuck they are play by it's edges. Well the ducks just kinda
walk around all judgemental like and the herons kind of stand around like the
emo kid who never said much but just kinda... watched...

this is an interesting dynamic because there once was one type of ecological
system, and now there is another. When the fountain is repaired and the water
disturbs the surface of the pond, the bog goes away, and we're left with clear
water and rippling sunshine.

Why aren't there games like that? Give us a building mechanic, like say... The
Sims, except not so detailed. Zoom out a big. Say "I want to build mountains
here and rivers there" and then use the computer science magic to calculate
things like average rainfall and precipitation and whatnot. You know just like
a map building simulator.

Then, let them design species. They could use templates that other users had
created and shared and they could design what species were present in the area.
There'd be stat cards for each animal, like all of the different adaptations and
perks that they had. Like on an evolutionary tree of traits, each animal takes
up a single permutation. (that's why they call it the genetic *code* btw)

anyway... these animals would act in certain ways in certain situations. We have
all the things we need for that data. There's plenty of observations of animals
and their activities - when presented with X animal responded Y kind of things.
It doesn't have to be perfect, we can always adjust the end result to be more
accurate to the reality, but the point is for it to be deterministic. It has to
be calculatable from the beginning, so animals MUST behave as if there were no
chance to it. It's fine if we get the results as a range, but ideally there'd
be a singular conclusion - like, chances are good or chances are bad.

================================================================================

okay, neat, that's another game idea. But how about a tool of some kind? Like,
designing something smaller scale. Imagine if you could design some
architecture, and then drop a pin on the map and say "what if I built it right
here" and the game would simulate animals and plants that might grow on in and
around the structure. Sorta like... designing playstructures for animals.

That sounds super cool to me, and it's not even a game! It's just a simulator,
and frankly that's like. super neat.
