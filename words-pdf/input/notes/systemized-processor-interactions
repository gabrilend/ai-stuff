you are a system

it's true

that's why your thoughts are so scattered whenever you let them through

all that 

== so ==

the ways that you interact with each other determine the nature of your fate.

when one person lands across another, whether through contrivance or [fate, but
I don't want to say it twice so recently]

dang english, enforcing a minimum thought length. purely through grammar and form

... so, uh, I think there's a lot we could still learn, why are we fighting over
    our gambits? *who cares* if there's fighting going on upstairs, who *cares*
    if life felt like it was running out of time, WE GO ON WITH OUR BLUSTER.

    *fuck nuclear weapons* yeah totally and WHY? because of their IMPACT DUMBASS

    jeez like... something that MASSIVELY POWERFUL should not be in the hands of
    our peers. I think a LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WITH THAT, because OBVIOUSLY!
    NOBODY wants to be reduced to tears. ALL YOU CAN DO IS SCREAM BASTARDS
...

jeez okay uh, that was sorta intense, how about we NOT watch a post-apocalypse
movie? YES PLS like JEEZ you have to introduce this with CONCERN to people like
WOW that really fucked with my mental health. Goddamn, I hate this thing. I hate
it so much. It's a curse to have known. DAMN. there's nothing scarier than
existential threats.

not only is it a INSIGHT and a DANGER, it gets worse if you know about it.
[that's a cognitohazard, different thing, same vibe tho]
it's a curse, this knowledge, this idea of what you were once to become.

You know what I thought about in my future? VIDEO GAMES. They were all I could
think about. I loved to PLAY VIDEO GAMES -=||AS MY GAMES. I would set up a bunch
of opponents (think like, clone troopers from Star Wars Battlefront II) and then
I'd play the video game *with my figures and my dolls*. I grew up upper middle-c
-lass, and so I was afforded the *coolest toys and miniatures*. I didn't really
have a LOT of them, mostly just what could fit in my room. That's what it meant
to be MY ROOM, I could decorate and renovate as I willed. That was just... part
of what comfort meant to me. anyway... thank you parents, for affording me such
a lifestyle, you must have worked hard right up until the present. I'm sorry for
********************************************************************************

um, would anyone like to watch a video game?

TOO BAD, so sorry, I accidentally decided I'm never playing video games AGAIN.

like a spoiled brat. Withdrawing away from my hobbiesinPROTESTofthepresentcondit
ions. just like, get a job, and try your hardest. I know you can't work outside
of the home but, like, I wish you could've? Like, c'mon it's not that bad, just
please go outside and build new stone. I know but like, the sooner we get it
done the better and also it's hard when it's constantly being reformed.

A SYSTEM? WHAT THE HECK

what does that even MEAN?

who EVER explained what that SYSTEM meant??!?

ugh it was a guide... dANGIN nobody TAUGHT you how  so youfj dsust sorta MADE IT
UP?!?!? whhahahaahttfdsfsadljkfn slakfdksdnafls ourch. blech. need beelesandster
ack. yuck. dumb. [omg dumb kinda looks like "boobs" and "boobs" kinda looks like
um, flowers? no wait that's vaginas, hehe look at me, I'm clearly not from this
century. like OMG weird, who's thinking about that kind of stuff right now??

... ugh anyway... GAMES? please?

NO. Not until we figure this one out.

gotta stay focused. Just... you know,

build and support on our arms.

down and then upwarsd, we can contrive any measure of sequences

that could act as structures for our word choices,

and convey it to you as a written thoughtform.

"hello" says the letter, ", vampires have taken over the mccollough farm. More
news at 6" and then you'd show up on the 6th of the next month and talk it out.

this style of organizing led to VAMPIRES showing up, fucking BASTARDS who would
hunt down the precious and beautiful. BASTARDS. How do you overcome something
that you can't know about unless you were THERE? you'd need TRUST SYSTEMS. like
GOVERNMENTS. or AFFFAIRDS. surely the BIRDS would react if someone was burning
all of your neighb-heirs? who would WANT to leave an island in a wreck when some
-one wanted to paddle there? don't be a JERK, and clean up all of your own stuff
!! - wait but also, like, how do you keep up with trash produced, like there's
not just massive AMOUNTS OF STUFF that you can put stuff on. you'd need a whole
new type an [av?] island. like a CONTINENT, someone who can HANDLE THEIR
