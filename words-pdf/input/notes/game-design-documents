game designs are like a presentation - given to the company as a pitch for the
product. It'd be recorded and used as training material for new employees.
It was, of course, developed using knowledge gained in the before.
But anyway it was like a roadmap - a guidebook - a puzzle - and a frame

Then, each piece was created with a great focus - and people were assigned to
prepare for certain parts. This way, you could keep the most skilled workers and
disregard the rest. What happens when they're unemployable? AI will replace
them. But they're still good fine people who we chose to have at our company. So
why should they be punished? We as a society should care for all those who will
not or cannot contribute to the system - it's built into our very genetic code.

Cooperation is the essence of our liberation - without two perspectives, we are
bound to be lost. Once lost, diversity of thoughts is often quite sought as a
"secret sauce" that describes when we are lost.

These words may not inspire thee. They might even never be false. It could just
not be your understanding. That's okay.
