good job on not being overscoped

agree on the fact that both supplies (wood, iron) are important
and food

level 1-10 is a little zone with a farm
a supply depot where you can take food and iron and wood and such
you can make units to patrol (like a tutorial)

at level 10 you'll get out and see there's other places (farm, mine, lumber
yard) you can capture from enemy faction which will increase how much you can
increase in your capital

each mine you capture increases the amount you can recruit in your capital
these supplies you can craft with through professions to make gear and supplies

defeating a mine boss for example can drop things like elemental tokens you can
use to summon soldier golems
