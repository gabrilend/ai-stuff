when you type the letters they slowly fade in on the other person's screen

like miniature explosions from layers of gunpowder

forming letters in the sky

anyway the text would "burn" into existence slowly and you had time after typing
your words to go back and edit them but also whatever you said was semi
permanent. Thus forcing a smooth and ideal progression toward thinking about
the things you say.

Also separate idea but it'd be neat if there was like... a show or something
that just recorded a person's desktop as they fucked around on the internet.
Call it... ambient desktopping. It'd look a little like those coding twitch
streams that just slowly update over time. Idk it's kinda cool
