how cherished is she that wanders with the
flowers in the garden of eden
under a big tree her heart she will leave
with all the designs she abandoned

I lay beside them and wonder about her
does she know we miss her horizons
I think she will mind if I have resigned
my fate to a life I will hide in

Oh how I do long for you

her symbol is the name
that lets us belong here
a falling a light and a leaving

if only our words were listened
but power is penance
and repentance is all that I have chosen

here in our sanctum we live with our only
and time will be gracious towards us
it's only our words that keep us
confined to our lights and our lonely

yet there and beyond her lights do belong
beyold in the land that is sanctum
here in our forest is our own dark forest
where we keep our silence to ward us

but there and beyond her heart does move on
free from her moments of longing
silent were we to the forests we plead
as terror has come for our moments

I think I'd find her
that cherished belonging
when she does at last come to warn us

how little we find of we find of thoughts from her mind
yet now we are kings of our own time
oh how she does wander true

how cherished is she
that wanders with ye
here in the garden of eden
under a big tree her heart she will leave
with all of her fears since abandoned

I lay beside her and find her defined here
will she know we miss her horizons
I think I will mind if I have resigned
my fate to a life I will hide in

oh how she grows fond of you.
