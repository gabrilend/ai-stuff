how cherished is she
that wanders with the
flowers in the garden of eden

under a big tree
her heart she will leave
with all her designs she abandoned

I lay beside them and wander beside her
will she know we miss her horizons

I think she will mind,
if I have resigned,
my fate to a life I will hide in,

oh how I do long for you.

her symbol is the name that lets us belong here,
a falling, a light, and a leaving,

if only our words were listened.
but power is penance, 
and repentance is all that I have chosen.

here in our sanctum we live with our only
and time will be gracious towards us

it's only our words that keep us
confined to our lights and our lonely

yet there and beyond, her lights do belong,
beyold in the land that is sanctum

here and before us is our own dark forest
where we keep our silence to ward us

but there and beyond, her heart does move on,
free from her moments of longing,
silent were we, in our forest we plead,
as terror has come for our moments

I think I will find her, that cherished belonging
when she does at last come to warn us,

how little we find, of thoughts from her mind,
yet now we are kings of our own time.

oh how she does long for you.

how cherished is she
that wanders with the
flowers in the garden of eden

under a big tree
her heart she will leave
with all her designs she abandoned

I lay beside them and wander beside her
will she know we miss her horizons

I think she will mind,
if I have resigned,
my fate to a life I will hide in,

oh how I do long for you.
