okay picture this - a movie script (or something) based in the medieval ages
whose main characters are rats inside a castle. But it's not just any castle,
it's got this cool fountain network in the walls. So they basically live in a
water park when it rains, and when it's not raining it's like this huuuuge
network of tunnels. Basically medieval internal plumbing in a castle. and the
rats have this society and they have (simple and primitive) rules - like they
started unlocking the social technology skills that humans did. Like tribalism
and compassion and value exchange and all the things that were necessary to
form civilization. anyway that's the setting the vibe is sorta like mouseguard
with a little bit of civilization and eventually (LA from diminions) a bit like
van helsing with vampire hawks and such. so... medieval rat van helsing and a
friendly antagonism between the "humans" and "vampires" (rats and hawks)
