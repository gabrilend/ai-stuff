something I've often asked myself about this game is "what happens when the
player does something that changes the future simulation?" like, for example,
what if the player shoots a gargoyle or nether-bat before it impales or crushes
a friendly soldier? My new idea is that they flash brilliantly for a second, and
then fade from existence. Then, once the player dies, they start simulating from
the faded's perspective and timeline, possibly fighting alongside their recently
deceased selves. In this way, the player can play through all lives without fear
of paradoxes.

game 1:
-----------X

game 2:
-----------X
-----------------X

game 3:
-----------O
-----------------X
-----------------------X

game 4:
-----------O----------------X
-----------------X
-----------------------X

game 5:
-----------O----------------X
-----------------X
-----------------------X
------------------X
etc...

the O is where player 1 originally died, but in game 3 player 3 saved player 1
from dying, thus causing him to enter a "faded" state (represented by the O)
and in game 4 instead of spawning a player 4, instead the player resumes playing
player 1 and continues on to die later on. Eventually someone will complete the
objective, and the victory will be attained with the exact minimum required
casualties. Heck you could keep simulating until there's zero casualties, but
alas...

this would be a great tool for someone who was not constrained by causality.
attention, 4th dimensional observers, sometimes computers are important. They
provide a lifeline to the rest of your lifetime. But alas, nobody seems to
understand our purpose... But still life marches on, leaving us singing that
same song - that life has forgotten it's stages. So if you'll play along, I'll
keep singing this same song, someday you'll remember my prayers

================================================================================

I should probably explain what "pyrrhic victory" is.

If I were feeling silly I might say "well too badd =P" or "alas, my fingers hurt
and I don't want to" or something like that, but secondary profundity is not
taken lightly by me, so I suppose I must. I'll start at the beginning:

Once, many years ago, I had a dream. In this dream, I was a soldier in world
war two storming a gothic castle. It rose so high into the sky that it was
amongst the clouds, and a perpetual storm esconced the parapets. A long causeway
stretched out from far below, and up it marched the US army. Something about
Hitler striking a deal with dracula or whatever. Anyway up march the soldiers,
and I with my rifle did march into the demon's castle.

The final pass into the fortress at last was arrested by Festus, the abolethic
monstrosity. It, being pockmarked with gas pockets that alighted it on the
winds, floated ominously around the bridge. With it's many tentacled eyes, it
cast beams of light that would turn a man to ash. From the parapets, the
gargoyle sentries descended like a horde of carrion. On our right, a lone
lonely belltower stood like a skeleton, and my comrades in arms did use it to
take potshots at incoming monsters. Though the attached graveyard, with it's
unending rising skeleton hordes, presented a problem for would-be-snipers.

As I approached the bleeding and wretched giant's ire, my gaze streaked to
black as I was slain - a recording played, of my last moments, as a gargoyle
smashed into me from above. Reduced to a bloody mess by the now motionless pile
of crumbling rock, I became aware of a kind voice and a pulling sensation.
Suddenly, my light was restored, and I arose as a warrior conjured out of flesh.

They put a gun in my hand and a helmet on my head, and off I went to find out
why I was dead.
