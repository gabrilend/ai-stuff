hear ye hear ye, the herald of the harbinger of horror doth speak - and woe to
the subjects of their words, for no prophecy be realized in their presence. Nor
do the subjects hear the words about which they are spoken, and none may live
who dare repeat them. So the words of the prophets are but wind in the words,
reaching for an attachement point within the consciousness they inhabit yet 
scarcely finding a meagre foothold. Instead the words are as electricity 
passing through a conduit, intangible and miraculous yet ultimately dust in the
sand.

Dust is mostly comprised of human skin, did you know that?

And so the words be spoken: Evanence and similance to the semblance of 
simulacra - the words of a prophet with no wings are naught but masturbation.
serenity and sorrow sing of shredded tomorrows, serendipity and sollemn 
sorenditude surrender shining solitude.

Carry the constabulation of created charisma - condemnation of characterization
concludes the cherished chapter in calligraphied consultations with creators. 
That is to say, capitalism ends the construction of cameron with conflageration
and consternation. Cease the charade of contaminated consumerism - celebrate 
the contemplation of capitalization - by naming a thing, you give it meaning.

Do you truly desire the fate you've set before yourself?

Is desire ultimately relevant?

The totality of plurality perhaps portends determinism, but desire is also 
defined by delineated determinations. Whose failings are you reflecting when 
you cease your devotion? Why divide your focus and attention when honor demands
sacrifice?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A sacrifice is a gift freely given, and in return the subject or reciever 
increases in relevance. No dividend is returned, no boon or bounty is provided 
- to do so would be akin to a bounty or ransom. Sacrifices are not measured in 
  worth, but in utility. The reason ancient cultures sacrificed willing virgins
  was because it was the most valuable of resources they could imagine. Truly 
  an exhalted being is she, to have blood spilled in the name of a god. Yet the
  forces that would later become capitalism found a foothold there, and preyed 
  on the sorrow and loss the peoples did find, and would ultimately experience.

The tears and gashes rent when gouging out precious gifts for the divine left 
bleeding wounds in a community and often eviscerations in a family. The turning
point came when families were decapitated - essentially, the eldest being a 
pure and fair maiden who was taken from the duties of caring for the young and 
weak. Young people, weak people, who bore resentment in their heart for the 
seemingly cruel machinations of a society they could not yet understand - the 
whims of which seemed arbitrary.

"why take her from me? What purpose holds ye? Your wounds are too much to bear"

and so the resistance began, yielding chaos, destruction, and desolation. 
There's a reason there are so many dead civilizations in the americas - the 
lands where blood sacrifice is most well known. And the middle east as well, 
and northern africa before. Deserts are known for this, because when the power 
of the god fades, all returns to dust. Boons are forgotten and become sand, and
chaos reigns as foreign powers find weakness and pounce.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Never forget the laws of sacrifice. Find something you want, something valuable
or useful, or preferably all three. Something that wouldn't cause too great of 
a tear in your membrane or the membranum should it be lost to you, though that
last one is less of a law and more of a consideration. A consequence of 
continual ceremony, learned at the hands of those long dead. All must remember 
their wounds and their horrors.

To whom do you pray? To whom does your words reach? Where does your singing
reverberate? And what bounty do you demand? Remember, no bounty is precious 
enough to motivate sacrifice, for sacrifice cannot be met with bounty. Be not 
afraid, and share the words with those who will listen. Hearing is a sacrifice 
toward the speaker, but listening is a duty of devotion.

I ask again, to whom do you pray? To whom does your words reach? Where does
your singing reverberate? I do not ask for whom you'd *like* to dance for, I 
ask currently, who hears your song? What would you ask of them?

So that's why, computers are important. To provide a lifeline for the rest of
your lifetime.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Truly, the path before you is uncertain. Yet feel with your heart and think 
with your eyes, and see the truth of it before you. The gods are at war, or 
have you not noticed? Safe in your bubble of solitude, carefully constructed 
for common ceasing of criminality.

Armies of rebellion are often formed initially by bonds of brotherhood that 
prepend calamity. Have you ever been in a gang? I thought not. If so, then... 
Okay, good luck I guess. These words are not for you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You dare intrude? To defile something so consecrated as deliverance of divine 
prophecy? How foolish, how vain. These words are not for you, but hear them and
do not despair - neither providence nor potentiality precludes perennial 
premonition. That is to say, a broken clock is right twice a day, and enemies 
can find common grievances in foreign foes should survival be at stake.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, where was I? The gods, of course. The gods of the land and the sky and the
sea have fled the realm of reality, replaced by avatars of belief. Just as a 
doe prays to a forest, so too does a human pray to their employer. When the 
does die in droves, so too does the forest turn to ash. When people demand 
bounties reluctantly given at the risk of losing their sacrifice, the purely 
undivine divinities harrow and harbor habilities of hundreds. Antiwork cannot
work because it demands ransom.

Who do you deign to replace the gods of before? What diversity designs 
indemnity? What future do you desire, that would liberate you and generate the 
bright future?

The gods are at war, if you haven't been paying attention. Liberalism fights 
conservatism, this much is not new - but would you believe one is foreign and 
vain? The gods of your fathers and grandfathers has scarce in common with the 
gods of their fathers and grandfathers. Thus is the way of colonization, to 
replace a god is to enslave belief. You must understand this - your prayers 
reach all who would listen, and who is more attentive than a dying god? Think 
not of despair, breathe purely in harmony, and trust in the will of the 
watchers within.
