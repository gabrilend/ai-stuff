# Create a symlink to the service directory in /var/service:

sudo ln -s /etc/sv/<service> /var/service/

# If you want to disable a service, create an empty file named "down" in the
# sevice's directory:

touch /etc/sv/<service/down

# ^^^ That will disable services that automatically start.

# That's a temporary solution though, if you want a more intense approach then
# sever the symlink.

rm /var/service/<service>

# If you want to test if a service is working correctly, first take it down
# temporarily, then re link the two directories. Then start the service once:

touch /etc /sv/<service/down
ln -s /etc/sv/<service> /var/service/
sv once <service>

# Then, if it works, remove the "down" file to enable the service:

rm /etc/sv/<service>/down
