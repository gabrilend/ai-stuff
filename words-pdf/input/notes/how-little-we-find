how little we find of thoughts from her mind
yet now we are kings of our own time
oh how she is wander true

DEAR VR DESIGNERS:

when making trailers for your game, create a separate camera in the game engine
and record from that.

keep the player character invisible, but just... watch from a distance

like they're an actor in a scene

ummmm oh dear she's crazy, what the heck

[no this is just what it's like to see stars]
