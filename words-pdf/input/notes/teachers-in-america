teachers should embrace chatGPT. It's how the kids are going to be working in
their future, so why not let them practice their skills? PLEASE don't let there
be a "ChatGPT class" - that'd be a horrible idea. It's such an intrinsic change
to our operating procedures that it needs to be taught in relation to every
subject. Math, science, history, literature, everything... it's all affected.

Don't punish people for using a new tool at their disposal. Reward them and give
them the space to put their skills to a test. Raise your standards, teach them
complex subjects that they can ask infinite questions about. Your time is no
longer divided between 40 students, you now have a TA that can flawlessly answer
any question they might have. Your personal touch is still important, you can
help them ask the right questions. Guide them through the thought patterns of
the truth.

If we do not adapt, our coming generation will be flatfooted. Give them the
tools they need to succeed. The world is changing in a fundamental way and they
need to be adaptable.
