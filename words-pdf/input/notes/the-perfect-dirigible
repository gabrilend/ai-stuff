we have drones now

put a mirror on a bunch of drones

have them aim the mirror at a zeppelin

heat it up

aim the mirrors away when you want to go down

boom no emissions

all you need is to power the drones somehow

maybe with a charging station on the dirigible

they can fly in, charge, then fly out

the barge could be covered in solar panels to help with the charging

or maybe wind power?

basically you can create a floating island that is powered by the elements

with drones controlling lift via mirrors and heating lighter-than-air gasses

it's flawless
