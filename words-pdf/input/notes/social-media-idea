it's sorta like a mix between twitter and twine

people post 255 letter posts

these posts each have comments

and you can click on hyperlinks that have pictures attached (or maybe an emoji?)

the pictures are so you know what each link leads to

But yeah it just leads to another post that is probably a continuation of what
the author was saying. and you're given an editor sorta like Twine and you can
create all the connections with hyperlinks and whatever. So like imagine if
Twine added a discussion box underneath every chapter.

This "Tangle" of interconnected posts and their associated comment threads and
their myriadic pathways of connection create a new type of engagement - that of
the completed thought. It'd be like... Making a video and posting it on
TikTok, same amount of engagement required. Anyway people could make comments,
whether they be text or video or w/e it doesn't matter.

But here's the cool part: it would be owned by the community

Hardware costs money. To run and maintain. Of course most companies don't need
to worry about the maintanence these days, since most people just contract out
to a datacenter and have all the computations run there. Only the largest of
companies do it on their own, and they know what they're doing.

So... if you wanted to have a community run computer program, it'd need to be
run on real hardware. And that hardware cannot exist anywhere but the cloud.

We've tried to do it with decentralization, but unfortunately the internet
infrastructure in America just isn't designed with mesh connectivity in mind.
It was a consequence of the era, that technology could not bridge the gaps of
their requirements, and so they created it more like a bus. Oh well, busses are
faster than walking.

Anyway. Datacenters are placed in areas that recieve high amounts of internet
connectivity. They are the perfect place to house something like this.

So, how would it generate money?

Ah yes well unfortunately we live in a capitalist society, so the infrastructure
of the new digital age must be capitalist as well. It's the only way to ensure
that our structures remain stable - the technological singularity will come
before the economic collapse.

So sure, fine good whatever - what does this have to do with funding?

Oh right so basically everyone would have their credit card details attached to
their account, and they'd pay anytime they wanted to create a post or comment
or whatever. And I'm talking like, a tenth of a tenth of a cent per comment. As
much as you need. No profit involved.

It'd be sort of like a community garden, something that brings us together and
unites us as countrymen.

I don't really understand -

okay shut up I'll explain it to you. I mean ask questions if you have them but
here we go:
imagine a program that can be run on anyone's computer. It's just a social media
client. It connects to various datacenters, depending on demand, and it allows
you to view (free) and contribute to (paid) social media. This media would be
pure and subjective, it'd reflect our purest designs and greatest of minds.
Purely a technologists utopia.

And how would it work? It's not complicated, it's just a networking protocol
that creates and maintains listings in a purely open and public manner. Anyone
who asks for a record can see it, and anyone who has the encrypted key can
edit or delete it. There's no record of it changing, that's purely up to the
end user. There's no transaction occuring, only a marking of what changes.
(meaning like counting the number of times you left a comment)
It'll stay up until you delete it, and every month you'll get a charge to your
credit card bill that says "your posts cost 3 cents in electricity"

It'd be more complicated than just electricity though, I mean you gotta pay for
the hardware. So there's of course an added fee for buying the parts, and hiring
training and preparing techs who can maintain the software. And of course
there's property taxes, and the cost it takes for air conditioning... They add
up, especially in such strict climate demands.

You could write a program that simply stores data on a hard drive -
encapsulating memory registers into data structures that are then labelled as
black boxes and used like puzzle pieces to construct the spatio-temporal
manifestation of the computer program. A solid design made of the simplest of
lines is eternally confined to define our new minds.

================================================================================

Right so back on topic it wouldn't be that hard to make, and something 
bare-bones and simple would surely be attractive to people who are fed up with
all the annoying bells and whistles of Reddit, TikTok, Youtube, Twitch, etc
