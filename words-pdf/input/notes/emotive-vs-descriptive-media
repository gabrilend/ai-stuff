music is an example of "emotive media". It (usually) lacks a description of
events, but it seeks to instead express the feelings and emotions of the people
involved. Video games are another example, and so is essentially every comedy in
existence. All of them deliver a sensation to the brain of the viewer, causing
or provoking compatible methods of thought.

A textbook is a different kind of media, as is a newspaper, a text message, and
even the bits stored in the hard drive of your computer. It is an analysis, a
description, and an incredibly complicated configuration of microscoping
physical switches. But functionally it is no different than a page design of
pictures, graphs, blocks of text, and organizational meta-data like page number
or article number. These types of media, "descriptive media", are purely
designed to inform.

these two options exist on a spectrum, ranging from "most technical" to "most
empathic".
