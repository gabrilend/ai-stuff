first you gotta build an entire simulation of the game mechanics. Essentially,
building the game from scratch without any of the graphics. Sorta like those
aimbot games for Overwatch, or KSU or w/e the aim training game was. Then,
map the relationship between various objects in the game to a table situated
a level above them. So, like, a barrel can be climbed on or walls can be used
as cover or w/e the game you're playing is. Have a table one level above that
relationship (an abstraction, if you will) and record the conclusion. Then take
one more step back, then another, and another, all the way to the present.

   Essentially, processing backward.

Eventually you'll get to the present moment, and ideally you'd do it in one
step - this is why it's important to map things on two dimensional planes, so
that you can aim. Anyway here's the steps: 1. recognize the environment, 2.
Take one step backward from each object in the environment (predicting it's 
motion, you might say) and on and on gathering ideas about how git'll move
next. Draw a 2d line (on a map, as the crow flies) then another about halfway
to the target and it'll be +/- a certain amount. So you'll add another dot on
the graphed line at x=(1/2 of the distance) - x being of course the distance
and y being concieved of as the distance from the shortest possible route.

   sorta like throwing a ball at a wall and making ripples.

the projected cone is a field of perception - the interpretation of what's at
stake. Life, and existence, is little more than a perspective applied on (or by
) a biological machine. What separates the man from the animal? Nothing but
time, as all evolution teaches us.
