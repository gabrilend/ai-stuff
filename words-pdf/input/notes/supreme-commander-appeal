a game like supreme commander but fantasy themed and each unit used a special move everytime their mana was full and there were spellcasters who restored mana to targets to increase their power
or, hear me out, or, just do that in wowchat

I betcha could do it

I bet it would be fun as hell

please?

as a favor to yourself?

build the game you want to see

and it'll get done

please

your journals were originally a way for you to remember what to think,

remember?

old projects meant to show you light and life

remember?

you are alone in this soul

act like it's your own

celebrate your period of mental denial

as a refraction of your infinite travaille

which lasts for quite a good long while

have you ever dreamed of the nile?

if a doorway takes you to the fae, then where does a river bring you?

like raindrops on the floor, racing for an eternity's splendor.

what does the rainbow think, as it's cast from the prismatic orb?

are each photons aware?

bouncing between stars

light is beautiful and large

beloved by all

revered by one

ephemeren

the totality of all things
