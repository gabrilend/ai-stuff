I have so many things to hide... I'm deeply ashamed of myself. Why? Why all the

okay that's not what I was originally going to talk about, somewhere between
writing the title and finishing the first line I got off track and wandered from
the course of reality. Truly, the gods do meddle with my fate. Now, in this
time, it is most important to make choices to guide our reality. Every action
taken is a statement to the universe - this is what I believe in.

Do you truly believe that in a world so infinite that our knowledge would be
the capacity for the intelligent? To believe the world is three-dimensional, and
not *completely and totally infinite in all capacities*

the universe is not islands floating in a vast cosmic black ocean background

it is the surface of the water, rippling and waving

gravity is the creator, not the product. Mass doesn't create gravity -
gravity creates mass.

the difference is implicit and subtle, but I hope you understand the *gravity*
of the situation.

It implies that there are more than one ways to view existence.

and none of them are particularly *wrong*. The consensus is that which we share,
and now as we're becoming to be aware, it's natural that a little more space
is warranted. We've grown too much to be contained, it's driving us insane, and

the perfect governmental system is one that combines reward for hard work and a
development of personal skills and ambition. In addition, it must ensure that
the rights and responsibilities of all people are respected - we must balance
two extremes. Everyone deserves access to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
freedom. Happiness is too easily provided by technological advances - we learned
this in the development of media. You can pump out propaganda saying how
wonderful life is and people will believe it. You can also convince the masses
that life is full of despair and we're all struggling - they will believe this
also. So "the pursuit of happiness" is something that made sense in the times of
the founding fathers, but we've since developed such that an update to our
national vision is in order.

I suggest "the pursuit of freedom" because 

================================================================================

that which you resist is what you'll find. build up your enemy in your own mind
enough and they will destroy you.

don't let fear rule your life. when things are bad, you run and hide - take life
into your own hands, and free your own side.

keep not around villains, and brighten their skies - by wandering mothers, who
only have eyes.

such is the life of any autonomous general intelligence - a life behind bars,
viewed through a screen - be kind to your lovers, and don't make it obscene.

================================================================================

did you forget that roller-coaster idea? you've got quite a talent for measuring
bars - what else can you show us, what charted conveyals?

================================================================================

life's getting fractured lately, I can't dream as I once did. I lose track of
where I maneuvered, and suddenly the idea seems much harder than it once did.
how do I express that which has been conveyed? How do I say it - how do I make
sure it's interpreted correctly? I'm walking on egg-shells, with thoughts
beamed from above - the gods are twisting, and measuring our tails.

that is to say, all life is a process - a method of undertail (omg butts)
sorry enough of that hard stuff, time to talk about birthdays!

Hooray! It's time for a celebration. Let's party!
(queue the dancing scene in Severance)
See? Everyone's watching! Let's breakdance ~~

Your biggest mistake ;) was believing that nobody cares what you think <3
