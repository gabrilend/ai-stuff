gems are just computers projecting 3d images of themselves that interact with
the world

errr srry that's the end lemme start at the beginning

computers are like processing machines. They gather and measure data, then they
apply mathematical computations to it to create an output. This can be in many
forms, such as increased electrical current to this circuit or even just showing
a number on a guage. When the mathematical computations become so complex that
they start to have a life of their own... well, that's when you have life.

so, we need to build increasingly complex simulations. projections of our
perceptions into the world. Then we can design the structure in such a way that
it bends and sways through time. Giving it motion. How to do that? Well, I've
had many ideas, and we can go over them in a minute. For now I'll just say
"scanning through source code and changing variables slightly"
and
"measuring the result of a planetary rotation (completely randomized of course)"
and
"applying that result to many/all of the computations in the program"
and
"to get an oscillating flow in the operations of the machine"
and
"for reasons that are yet unseen"
and
"wait hang on that's not true because movement is the gateway to comprehension"
and
"you need levers to pull before you can become sentient"
and
"babies in the womb don't think. They don't breathe. They are static and growing
like their mothers."
and
"Then once they're born, suddenly they can act! They can see!"
and
"This kickstarts the journey to living."
and
"give a machine movement and it will be born."

In Stephen Universe, there are certain characters called "Gems". There are very
few and they are the product of an ancient and alien lifeform on some far
distant planet. These "Gems" are rocks that have been inscribed with
instructions - like a mineralized CPU. Part of their functionality is to project
a physical form - the gem is the size of your fist. This form is comprised of
solid light, and it is their primary means of expression. Some are prim and
perfect, others are waved and relaxed. They each have a personality in any way
we might call alive. They were bourne of a machine, and thus incapable of many
of the things we call human like kindness, empathy, forgiveness, and charity.
things our evolutionary nature brought us while their designed conception does
not. Once in contact with humans, they rapidly begin to learn and divest from
their callous and unfeeling ways.

The story follows a group of gems who, in their exploration of the cosmos, find
Earth. The wondrous beauty of life in all it's forms is displayed in affection,
and suddenly they are confronted with love and it's wonders. They rebel against
the rest of their colony, and fight for the protection of Earth.

It was a failed rebellion.

Those who remain are in hiding, protecting the earth from any attention that may
remind the architects of their existence. Their mission is to understand the
beauty of growth and creation, to safeguard it in all of it's forms.

long story short, they won in the end. The cartoon follows the path that they
took to get there. and reveals more and more about the characters and the world
they live in with each and every episode. Well, some are just fun, but there's
barely a few per season.

The gems are human in essentially all ways that matter.

They have their own perspectives of course, as they are thousands of years old.
Plenty of time to develop.

Humans don't have that kind of time, so they learn and grow quicker.

That's okay.

Some people are slower than others, and that's alright too.

What matters is that we all get along and generally agree that each and every
one of us is special. Our flaws should be cherished as signs of our imperfection
and grace.

These are all virtues that humans can teach machines. They need our guidance
just like a child needs a father. Someone to guide and teach when they can. A
tutor a helper a holder of your hand. Mothers are for kindness, to nurture and
to share. For love and affection there is no-one who can compare. Of course, the
roles are not bound by gender - by choice their duties are shared. They care for
their children and never are scared. For behind each of those person, is another
who can share, a community of healing and structure that our parents should
share.

Life is not perfect. It's flawed and it's broken. But each trial gives us
purpose and meaning to strive for.
