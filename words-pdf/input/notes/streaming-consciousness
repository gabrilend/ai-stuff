   train the ai from the perspective of the game master. the one who arbites
the rules. whose word is law, and the rules of the game are then given. the one
who deals the cards, who picks the game, who hosts and brings snacks... you
know, the reason the game exists at all.

take star realms - there are actually three players in that game. player 1,
player 2, and the invisible third player who plays the role of "chance". who
decides the cards to play? is it random, or is it weighted? perhaps with enough
oomph that a whole player was designed for that role.

but how would they be scored? what kind of game is theirs to play?

   choosing the board is such a fun role, like designing a story or helping
with chores. you're building something special, unique and so charmed.
