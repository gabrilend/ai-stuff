students should be in class no more than 50% of their time spent at school
the rest should be set aside for homework, socializing, eating, and resting.
whatever those mean to the student is what they'll organize their life around.
if you give them the choice to choose which classes they take,
they'll learn what they want to know about this world.
give them all kinds of options!
seriously, like so many!
and have teachers give talks every week or so.
they could travel around and stay at each school for a week or so,
before moving to the next *once their lesson was completed*.
and the kids could sign up for them by slotting them into their schedules
and they'd have the whole semester to think about what they wanted to take next
year
(the classes would be scheduled in advance.)

could be cool is all i'm saying
and it'd respect the child's autonomy to give them choices.
who are you to say what is most important to a child?
who are you to know what guides them so?
who am I indeed
