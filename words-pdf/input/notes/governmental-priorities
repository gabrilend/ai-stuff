the first priority of a government should be in producing enough to satisfy all
the needs of it's inhabitants. Once it can do that it can begin moving it's
economy into a new stage of development - one where nobody needs any money
because they can have whatever they want. If you want a car, sure. If you want
17 cars, then maaaaaaybe you need to produce something related to cars. I mean,
it's only fair that you contribute to what you value.

you don't have to have just one job, too, you could sign yourself up for
several at once and they would notify you when you were needed. Basically giving
them customized availabilities that they could discuss amongst themselves and
figure out. Like, it doesn't have to be like... managers doing this, more like
just a simple computer program. Easy, simple, and done.

if you work for two companies in the same industry, there can be NO restrictions
on what you can say or do. Because when knowledge is not lost, but repeated
through the generations, we can have progress. And progress advances us toward
the meta objective, the goal that transcends all the battles in the war, if you
get my drift.

they say the atom bomb ended the war, but the blood of men is what won it.

maybe it's the same with the economy? Maybe we should be pooling our efforts to
generate something that "ends the war" with scarcity? We could solve global
warming and create new wondrous things that are beautiful to behold.

I'll ask you again, do you want to live forever?
