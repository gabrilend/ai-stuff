there is a requirement for a simple, easy to set-up, and easily replacable
system which can be used for comms.

Specifically running a variety of different services, such as fediverse
instances, matrix for text-comms, VoIP, and distributed computing using Chapel
or DistCC or other such capabilities. In addition, it should be able to run a
file-server and a web-server which hosts an HTML page for the user.

All of this functionality should be operational out-of-the-box, with minimal
configuration required. No more than adding a checkbox to a config file in order
to activate each individual service.

This box should be cheap, and easy to provision. An image must be made, and
some bash scripts should be written to easily configure it.

In addition, there should be rudimentary programming capabilities included, just
in-case a user is left with no other options. It should come pre-configured with
SSH access out of the box, so it can be remotely controlled, and the languages
included should be:
   C/C++
   Python
   Lua
   Bash
   Rust
   Chapel
This should cover most surfaces in terms of programming capability requirements.

In terms of hardware, it need be little more than a SoC such as a Raspberry Pi
or other such hardware. It needs at a minimum an ethernet port, and USB ports.

The box itself should cost no more than 40$, excluding provisioning and the cost
to pay back whatever capital investments are necessary to create such a thing.
