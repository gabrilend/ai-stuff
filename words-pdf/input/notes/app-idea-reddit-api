Here's an idea: A program that uses the Reddit API to create an account with a random username and password and automatically subscribe it to every state subreddit for all 50 states. It would be a lot of posts from a lot of different places, but someone could endlessly scroll and find more and more news stories that were relevant to them as a nation. They'd hear about ongoing struggles in other places, and they'd yearn to help them. They'd hear of other's struggles, and they'd see how they could apply their lessons to their own lives. Like... Maybe there's a factory upstream that pollutes a river - well, we should probably do something about that and make it so that it doesn't happen ??? like... duh ??? The problem is we don't want to spend the resources on it. We'd rather focus on growing as much as we can. The issue is, of course, that we'd run out of resources eventually, but eh oh well. Oh yeah you gotta make sure that each account has an equal amount of posts between each region.
