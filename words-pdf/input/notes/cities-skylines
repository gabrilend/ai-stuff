I think my favorite house would be massive - like the size of a mall - but every room is connected to 2+ rooms (except closets or bathrooms or kitchens or other specialized rooms) and it would be designed sort of like a miniature city.
﻿
right now, if my knowledge of Cities: Skylines (video game about building cities) is accurate, then city planning engineers will plan out a city such that every part of it is served by various utilities, like gas, water, electricity, but also things like fire stations and hospitals and commercial areas. My idea is sort of like a small-scale version of that - each part of it would be connected to various utilities like gas, water, electricity, but also things like ~~fire stations and hospitals~~ laundry machines and kitchens and bathrooms and OH OH here's an idea what if there was mood lighting all the time and it was super comfy BUT whenever you took a picture on your phone or w/e the sensors in the room would pick it up and every light in the room would flash at once - idk I think it'd be cool

okay but for real why don't people buy dead malls and build houses in them? I feel like the issues with converting skyscrapers (that they're too difficult to wire up with amenities - for example office buildings have like, 2 restrooms per floor, depending on the size of the building... it's not feasible to put in like a million water / sewage lines for everyone... c'mon that's crazy expensive (meaning, difficult or labor/material intensive) BUT BUT anyway in an open mall like the kind that are in those
