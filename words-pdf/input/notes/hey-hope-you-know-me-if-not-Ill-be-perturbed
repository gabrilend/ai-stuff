hi, so... yeah I'm a strange person

it's tough to get to know me

and this probably feels cringe to read

but I once heard you should kill the part of you that cringes

so... here's me

I'm 

================================================== stack overflow ==============

... where was I? oh yes and THAT's when the nail went through the roof, and it
    scared the heck out of... wait, what was I talking about? OH yes so anyway

I was born in the cool summer of 1864 - there was a rustling breeze that held a
steady note for the entire evening, and into this world I arose. [awoke?]

my mother held me but for a moment before I was whisked away to be cleaned and
cared for. this was unusual for the time, as most mothers clutched their
children to their breasts. But alas, I alone was spared her touch, and so I was
cast (as if in bronze) as my own volition.

as I had grown, I heard tales of distant times, and assumed they were places you
could go. Then, when my time came to wander, I found nought of what I had grown
most fonder - though I did find plenty else, besides.

Instead, times are places we travel through, as a cripple might ride on a cart.
across the sea, through lands of mystery, viewable only from the road. In 1864
that's how other lands you'd come to know.

As I travelled from place to place, it felt as if a stage had been cast, with a
single actor or three illuminated as a spotlight. "Here, pay attention to me,
I'm here for the story and the plot!" though often I'd glance around, and hear
mostly my own thoughts, I grew to learn to appear.

different themes, different tales, if you want to see a most marvelous scene,
take a baby to Disney World and only pay attention to what they're looking at.

My grandfather worked there, so in my first year or so I spend a LOT of time
there. My parents were very dedicated to raising me, I appreciate every moment
of it. Which... Is probably not a good thing to say on a transfemme server,
oops I should delete that part [esc->k->k->k->0->v->shift(held)->G->$->"->*]

also I should mention I'm stoned as fuck this is just what I do
