| I don't think you're ever been out in the rain
I don't think you've heard as it's falling around you
I don't think you know, just what I mean,
I think you're alone... With your thoughts.

(left)
Tell me what you think I do, all the times I think of you? don't give me
anything back

(right)
Did you know that it's...?

(center)
When you know it's dark, you make it dark

(right)
oh, it's so dark

(center) 'Cause you've never been

(all) taught how to see

(left + right)
do you really think we live in a

(center) 3d world?

(all) 3d world

(center) or, simply, a projection

(right) yeah, it's probably that

(center) if you didn't have your eyes, could you see where you were?
if you didn't have your body too? Where's your sense of direction, is it lost
in the rain? Keep it close to your heart

(left) Have you ever once heard of proprioception, and have you ever felt like
you were an artificial inception?

(left + right)
if my words ring true, it's possible that you, are not quite so alone

(center)
But...

(right)
our eyes, are fallible all lies, untenable, take it from me, it's going, to be,
quite, a sopping evening.

(left)
perception, begets reality, and lo, we only see what we want to see

(center)
if you ever felt like you were closer to, another mind than your own, sorry but
you're schizophrenic

(left)
if only you could see, if only you could see,

(left + center) just what's inside of me

(right)
say it again, don't say it again, same thing you always say - it's not real,
no YOU'RE not real, I only want to play

(left)
tear me apart, look me into my feelings. they're gonna scar anyway, no time for
healings

(center) if you couldn't save anyone,

(center + left) did you really save anyone?

(right) you couldn't save me, but only for lack of trying

(Center) we're all falling leaves, in the waves of the ocean

(left) don't enjoy me just leave me

(center) going faster and faster till our hearts do stop

(left) please, I can't be here for me

(right) never trust a guru, life isn't meant to be enjoyed

(center) so... What's the point in trying at all?

(left -> right) say it again, don't say it again

(center) what's the point in giving up?

(right) same thing you always say

(left + center) some people say

(right) it's not real, no YOU'RE not real

(left + center) they wanna live forever

(right) some people say

(left) some people say

(center) I only want to play

(left and right) we'll always be growing

(right) and some people say they wanna live forever

(left) but they don't understand what I understand

(right, followed by center) but they don't know what I understand

(left) they don't know how it's just a game

(right and center) they don't know how it's just a game

(left -> center) I think it's okay no matter what our fate

I think it's okay
