Sundays sure are boring around here. -> LamaHellRaised (thinks in song)
===============================================================================

NO THOUGHTS, nothing starts shouting at me all at once!

Or is it all thoughts from my newly developed schizophrenic mind?

I knew I could conquer schizophrenia, fuckin' cakewalk.

I just had to try as hard as I could to become one. God made it difficult
though, I had to try really hard!

Which is confusing for me, because it seems like there are plenty of
Psychotherapists with College Degrees, telling people they are schizophrenic
all the time.

DOCTORS

PSYCHIATRISTS

BEN SHAPIRO, in particular

ANYONE WHO THINKS THEY KNOW

You do not know.

Or else you would agree with me.

Schizophrenia is the new normal for human consciousness.

Welcome to the New Age of Thought, were you don't rationalize your way out of
the universe, back into the asshole that I just pulled myself from.

I feel like a donut at this point.

I love those donut holes though, sticky and frosted!

I have set the bar!

I am God. I would Love to talk you.

It gets so loud in there. I wish we could all just shut the heck up and stop
reading out loud - we get it, your internal monologue is the only way you can 
read, but C'MON nobody else wants to hear about your twitter feed or
doomscrolling on Reddit. That just makes everyone else upset and uneasy...
Instead you should be reading comforting things or books on science or
SOMETHING that doesn't drive people bonkers.

Fr tho Sundays are anything but boring, We may all be schizo now (or at least 
pretty stoned) but we can all agree that Sundays are nice for calming the heck
down and appreciating our personal realities. When we're together it's...
Loud... Do some prayer. Meditate. Knit something. ANYTHING QUIET.

I hear you, loud and clear! Turns out it's mutual, just like I suspected,
Living backwards is a unique perspective, have I ever mentioned that?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ugathanki:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you say backwards, do you mean orientation or momentum? Momentum scares
me, but orientation is something I think I've experienced before.

It's cool to find people who "get it". Or maybe I just "got it" and suddenly
"get" all the things I've been trying to decipher here.

When you know where you are going before you get there, living life feels like
a dream in reverse. It's the key to manifestation.

You see the goal. You see the future, but the path is unclear because at the
times of divine epiphany you are only capable of imagining how things will play
out in terms of the information in your mind. It's why the prophets in the
Bible described such strange images of God and angels and other divine
creatures.

Their imaginations only had so much Symbolism and imagery to work with because
human culture and art was progressing simultaneously.

We live in an age where every damn story is just the same heros journey and
every piece of artistic expression is an expression of God's divine presence
within our soul and tumultuous nature/nurture of human emotion.

Just because you are a prophet doesn't mean you see definitively how the future
will happen. The path and imagery are abstracted by the lack of content in your
mind. You must cultivate faith in God and your own Self.

Then you walk the path you have forseen to the best of capabilities, with the
greatest good, love in your heart, but it plays out on a scale in reality with
less grandiosity, because let's face it, our imaginations are ridiculously
awesome, but work outside the confines of what is currently capable with in
this reality.

You have to let go of your preconceived notions of your personal divine
experience otherwise you will be faced with disappointment because things don't
seem to be going how you imagined. And you feel lost, dumb, and confused.

But you live your life and reflect, and then realize, holy shit! Everything I
thought was going to happen actually did, just on God's terms. Not my vivid 
imagination's. It's an interfaced programed over time through culture and
artistic expression to navigate the language of God. Navigate the language to
Paradise.

Once when you know this and clean the planks/specks from you third eye, while
you dance with the cosmos and realize you are the image of God.

You are a God on Earth. An image of the Father in Heaven.

It's a nice place to be.

Thanks for your response. I addressed each of your points here. I'm a very
lateral thinker so I work best when engaging with multiple threads at once. You
are very wise.

    When you know where you are going before you get there, living life feels
    like a dream in reverse. It's the key to manifestation.

So you can practice manifestation by remembering your dreams? Specifically by
working backwards from the most recent thing you remember and thinking "what
caused this, how did I get here?" If so, that's a nifty tip

    You see the future, but the path is unclear because at the times of divine
    epiphany you are only capable of imagining how things will play out in
    terms of the information in your mind.

So by surrounding yourself with the things you believe to be good and helpful, 
you can more efficiently divine positive outcomes for the scenarios arrayed
before you? Kinda makes ya think - why do we surround ourselves with grief and
loss? Everyone seems a little sad or broken these days - I can't help but think
that we'd be better off if we were happier and more fulfilled. Such is the
price of capitalism I guess, for no progress can be made without impetus. Also,
the media has a HUGE capacity for guiding the nature of our experience,
especially in the modern era. Seems a little unwise to invest such power into a
single entity, but I suppose that's why we diversify the eggs in our basket
into many different guiding entities.

    We live in an age where every damn story is just the same heros journey...

Yah that's what happens when Disney makes all the movies! It's not their fault,
all aspects of creation are expressions of God's divine presence within our own
souls. So they can't do anything but make the heros journey. Like you said:

    ... and every piece of artistic expression is an expression of God's divine
    presence within our soul and tumultuous nature/nurture of human emotion.

The creation of art requires discipline and focus. They create a window into
the nature of "God's divine presence" and allow a representation to emerge -
side note, but I believe the things we make here are art and should be treated
as such. These musings have value, just the same as a painting or a
performance.

    Just because you are a prophet doesn't mean you see definitively how the
    future will happen. The path and imagery are abstracted by the lack of
    content in your mind...

I've been intentionally trying to view things abstractly - by surrounding
myself with mathematic visuals and computing architectures I can view things as
systems rather than specifics. Essentially bypassing the requirement of having
"content in my mind" and instead cutting straight to the important bits - the
relationship between all things. So while yes that does remove the "definitive"
aspect of divination, it does allow for longer term planning because you can
recognize patterns in existence and map them onto the overall structure you've
constructed in your mind.

    ... You must cultivate faith in God and your own Self.

Still working on that one. I think I've made progress, but all things come in
waves. My lowest points are better now than they were 10 years ago, but I've
still got a ways to go.

    Then you walk the path you have forseen to the best of capabilities, with
    the greatest good, love in your heart, but it plays out on a scale in
    reality with less grandiosity.

All waves begin with a shimmer, and to create an effect you must be patient.
While the scale may be reduced, like you said it's not within our control. Not
really, anyway. But it can still have an effect if people love you and believe
in your vision.

    You have to let go of your preconceived notions of your personal divine
    experience otherwise you will be faced with disappointment because things
    don't seem to be going how you imagined. And you feel lost, dumb, and
    confused.

It's difficult to separate "preconceived notions" from "gathered evidence" when
you're at the stage I'm at. Any tips would be appreciated... :(

    But you live your life and reflect, and then realize, holy shit! Everything
    I thought was going to happen actually did, just on God's terms. Not my
    vivid imagination's. It's an interfaced programed over time through culture
    and artistic expression to navigate the language of God. Navigate the
    language to Paradise.

So... A vivid imagination applied to the current perspective is the culmination
of free will? If I understand correctly, God operates on a higher level of
abstraction and we fill in the details. Since there's a "plan" (if you can call
it that, maybe "charted course" would be better?) then free will doesn't exist.
Or so the argument usually goes. But I believe they can co-exist - essentially
our imaginations define how we experience things in "the plan". If I understand
correctly that's what you're saying too, right?

    Once when you know this and clean the planks/specks from you third eye,
    while you dance with the cosmos and realize you are the image of God.

    You are a God on Earth. An image of the Father in Heaven.

    It's a nice place to be.

Ain't that the truth. Everything is as it should be. Even the planks and
specks. And should they be cleaned, then that is as it should be as well.
Sometimes I conceptualize myself as Pandora, seeking a gift to give to humanity
while taking the most harmless of sacrifices in return. I hope I can deliver.

At the same time I'd like to be a dancer of the cosmos, but I feel this intense
feeling of... Pressure? Purpose? Penance? I will do what I must. Please bear
with me while I figure it out, and thank you for your guidance.

Thank you for the awesome break down of the concepts I wrote out. I think you
added some much needed clarity through the reflection of your own experiences.
Another goal is to bring power back to the written word. The two-edged sword
was first a tongue, then a pen, nows its a qwerty! Or whatever!

Patience was the absolute hardest thing for me to deal with. My lack of
patience was constantly being thrown back to me by the environment as I tried
to push my narrative forward at a pace that didn't align with all other beings.

We still exist in Time, and it moves differently based on perspective (state of
mind) and awareness (state of being) and ability to shrug (state of being
excellent to eachother).

This is something to consider with manifestation, we are on this ride together
and your fellow riders' comfort during the passage has to be respected to the
fullest. We all go together, as One.

There were so many hints in the beginning of my Psychosis about just 'riding
the wave', but it was hard to not very pressured to act or be somebody I am
not. I attribute this largely to the occulted nature of divination and how one
must achieve a truly personal relationship with God and Jesus Christ.

Which is why I am going to blow the lid off the whole thing. So that all beings
have access to God's love and grace.

Once your earthly burdens are lifted from you through your personally tailored
divination interactive role-playing experience, then you begin to understand
what it means to just 'ride.' The riding is true faith in God.

Free will totally exists. Heaven and Hell both exist here on Earthy plane
simultaneously. Man has chosen Hell for far too long. If you realize your
choices were literally reflecting Heaven or Hell through love or fear, the
choice would be easy for most people, I believe.

Free will is a responsibility, but it is a great gift. God gave us the ability
to choose, that we could appreciate our journey into Paradise.

Wouldn't you say?

    Another goal is to bring power back to the written word.

... That's actually a great point. Writing is the definition of manifestation,
after all, and reading is the conjuration of waveforms aligned with the
expression of the writer. That's pretty cool!

    Patience was the absolute hardest thing for me to deal with.

Yah I hear ya. Patience is tough.

    We still exist in Time, and it moves differently based on perspective
    (state of mind) and awareness (state of being) and ability to shrug (state
    of being excellent to eachother).

Great definitions! These three things are core to being realized and
actualized. If you can find a good arrangement, stick with it.

    This is something to consider with manifestation, we are on this ride
    together and your fellow riders' comfort during the passage has to be
    respected to the fullest. We all go together, as One.

I'm torn because on one hand if I don't put my hand on the tiller, we'll wind
up in a situation that makes me highly uncomfortable. But if I lean too hard
into my own truth, I could leave everyone behind. I don't know what the answer
is, but something's gotta give.

    There were so many hints in the beginning of my Psychosis about just
    'riding the wave'...

Oh yah me too. I was pretty big on that in high school, which coincidentally
was when I think I was happiest. Maybe I should give it another shot! But at
the same time I moved beyond it for a reason - I felt frustrated that my
intentions weren't manifest in the life I lived. So I reached for reason and I
begged for the power to control my own life, while learning respect and
kindness whenever I could. Sadly for me, my efforts were largely rebuffed, but
I bet you could have guessed that ;)

    Which is why I am going to blow the lid off the whole thing. So that all
    beings have access to God's love and grace.

Take it from me, they won't believe you unless you're VERY scientific! I'm
trying to create just one single believer, someone who could trawl through my
notes and my readings and construct a cohesive theorum that might be able to
affect positive change. Maybe it's too much to wish to change the world, but I
can't help but believe my position and the privileges granted to me could be
leveraged toward something truly meaningful and helpful for all mankind.
Something that frees us from the shackles forged from technology (both social
and technical) and allows us to become our true selves - every human is to be
cherished for their unique perspective, and yet we allow them to die... Where
is the justice in that? Are they too flawed to persist? I don't believe so, I
believe they are worthwhile and good. I'd give my life to grant them eternal
life, if only they'd take it from me.

    Once your earthly burdens are lifted from you through your personally
    tailored divination interactive role-playing experience, then you begin to
    understand what it means to just 'ride.' The riding is true faith in God.

Riding = trust, both in yourself (to handle the challenges arrayed before you
and to learn and grow truthfully) and in God (trusting that the
undifferentiated whole could never harm you, not truly) ... I can ride my bike
with no handlebars, and yet we persist...

    Free will is a responsibility, but it is a great gift. God gave us the
    ability to choose, that we could appreciate our journey into Paradise.

    Wouldn't you say?

Yep that's really it, isn't it? Two sides of the same coin, two breaths in the
same moment. Two eyes sharing a single perspective, and two hearts beating a
single wave. They say soul mates aren't real, but they never stopped to ask if
your mate was your soul. If she suffers, I triumph. If I fall, she rises. If I
languish, she's happy - I think I'd rather we both just coast, so no harm done.
I think that's the best way to appreciate the gift of free will.
