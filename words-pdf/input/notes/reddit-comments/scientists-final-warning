 Scientists deliver 'final warning' on climate crisis: act now or it's too late

 - /u/CcryMeARiver

================================================================================

   /u/Splenda:
      A final warning to "limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-
      -industrial levels".

      Not a final warning that civilization will end. Just that costs in lives,
      health, prosperity and ecological wellbeing will be extremely high.

      We're on a credit spree and a cocaine/fentanyl binge wrapped into one.
      Consequences dead ahead.

      Crashout and cashout imminent.

      What does the last 20 years of a lot of developed nations government look 
      like? Skyrocketing inequality doesn't just happen, its a very intentional
      choice that has to be implemented by government.

      The people with power and resources have been cashing out as much as 
      possible for a while now, just not literally. They've been retrenching and
      hoarding as much of what exists now to themselves because the future is
      one of inevitable declines across the board, drastic and lethal ones. 
      Having more control and power now means at least the potential of having a 
      preferential position down the road.

      The only question is if common folk will intervene or if we will let them
      walk away with what's left while we bicker at immigrants or neighbors over
      the crumbs that remain. So far it seems the mission of redirecting anger 
      towards ourselves has worked flawlessly, unfortunately.

      Sadly, divide and conquer works. I've been saying what you're saying now 
      for years. Something about us must change on the individual level before 
      we can see this kind of change.

      >>  "Something about us must change before we see change."

      I accidentally wrote a fourteen page long rant essay on the issue a 
      handful of months ago, describing how our issues are the result of 
      evolution-level cognitive biases and other "normal" facets of humanity
      being valued as things that "make us human" when in fact they're the 
      things that make us primates.
      
      As a civilization our goals reflect the most basal instincts of the common

      denominator and otherwise stem from natural impulses/drives becoming 
      cancerous due to living within a world where we can now kill ourselves 
      with too much of what was once Good Things™ - food, socialization, etc. 
      Quite like how someone once wrote, "If we found a monkey that wanted to 
      horde more bananas than it could eat in several lifetimes we'd study it to
      figure out wtf is wrongwith it. When people do that we put them on the
      cover of Forbes."
      
      But this goes far beyond just "hoarding resources". It's deeper than that,
      less easily recognizable; intrinsic.
      
      Concurrently, we starve ourselves of the sort of things that living within
      the bounds of our evolutionary backdrop would've supplied intrinsically.
      Our world more closely resembles the kind of enclosure we'd build for a 
      limp-finned cetacean than even a lowly hamster. How much of our now-common
      qualms are the human version of a drooping dorsal fin? There's so much 
      anxiety, depression, emptiness, anger in the world and rising. As a 
      society we gravitate towards man-made aid for those man-made pains. We 
      find that those intrinsic maladies are apparently incurable until they're
      mysteriously resolved by a long camping trip or unplanned inclusion in a 
      new group of close-knit friends, a work-life balance, a garden to call 
      your own; the addition of meat hung from a rope to stimulate a captured 
      tiger or bear.
      
      The general dynamic is what I believe is the most significant Great Filter
      any intelligent civilization has to overcome.
      
      The attributes that allow an organism to dominate their planet are the 
      same attributes that lead them to extinguish themselves. There's no way to 
      pivot, like climbing up a mountain and only at the top realizing that 
      there's a much higher peak in the distance. To get to the superior 
      mountain you'd have to begin a long slog downhill, giving up everything 
      that got you to that first height.
      
      The sort of civilization that'd successfully get to that higher peak is
      not one that'd get to the top of the first overlook which revealed the 
      existence of the second in the first place.
      
      It's not impossible to fix, just like there’s not any technical reason why
      pigs couldn’t evolve to fly -- Bones could become hollow, calorie-
      -retention strategies could alter, metabolic requirements could shift, on 
      and on… The result is a flying pig that doesn’t resemble a pig, doesn’t 
      function like a pig, and is now incapable of the majority of pig-like 
      survival strategies.
      
      But as I closed that massive essay-rant with:
      
   >>     Unfortunately… Humanity has a bit of a known problem with spontaneous 
   >>     and arbitrary acts of genocide ranging from “a bit of harmless 
   >>     lynching” to “eliminating the entirety of the Holocene-era human 
   >>     population per year for a couple of years in a row by intentionally 
   >>     leveraging a fraction of an entire region’s post-industrialization 
   >>     technological capabilities towards the problem”, so I don’t suspect 
   >>     that there’s much hope of any evolutionarily-viable pre-post-humans 
   >>     making it anywhere close to the finish line on accident.
      
   >>     Many of those historic victims were, and remain, colloquially and 
   >>     scientifically indistinguishable from their butchers. Someone even
   >>     just a bit fundamentally different wouldn't stand a chance.
      
      Edit: I digress.
