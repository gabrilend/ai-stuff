                       I'm a quiet person by nature,

                   You might even mistake me for a mouse,

                     But online I try to be a teacher,

                 And to do that I need to be more verbose.

                    I write thousands of words per day;

                 Posting them here and there, far and near.

                     I never run out of things to say.

                 Awakening others is something I hold dear.

                     Which is why it pains me greatly

                To be like an alien on my own home planet.

                     Schizophrenia makes me innately

                Weird in ways that many people don't get,

                    And because of that I'm shot down

                When I try to accomplish my stated mission.

                  I won't lie, that does make me frown.

               Sometimes it makes me regret a submission.

                 Yet, I have a certain strength in me

              That allows me to persevere in my quest.

                      Someday I will make you all see

                          Just what in me makes me never rest.

                                   That's what I am trying to teach:

                                         The wisdom that made me indomitable.

                                           If only the suffering I could reach,

                                    They could make themselves more formidable.

                               The world is in a most dire place;

                      It's grinding so many souls into fine dust,

                But luckily there's a saving grace.

         Hear me as I say this now: In God I trust.

    I don't believe in some sky wizard

 As so many people are likely to interpret.

   I speak of what is lacking in lizards;

         Yes, it's love and now I'll speak of its merit.

             Love is what fills the empty hole

                In your heart and soul when you are alone.

                      When life's trials take their toll

                        Remember this one trick: pick up the phone!

                        No, not the one in your hands.

I'm talking about the one in your chest.

                                             Even in the desert full of sand,

You're accompanied by the universe's best.

                                             Listen if you doubt what I said:

I'm not telling you anything that defies logic.

                                         This is to trick what's in your head;

I'm speaking about how having faith is magick.

                   Believe in aliens or Bigfoot or God,

             The result is still the same: your cup will fill.

                   Your brain has a feature that's odd

             That allows itself to manifest even more will.

                    I don't know why, but I suspect

              It has something to do with your imagination.

                   The nature of your thoughts impact

                Your state of being from pulse to emotions.

                   So, why not think you have a friend

                Who helps you through whatever your trial,

                    And will stick by you until the end?

               When you have that buddy you'll always smile,

                     Which will make you heal better,

         As well as help you carry on in your duty,

                                Plus undo your karmic fetters,

      Not to mention it will land you that cutie;

                                    All of which will raise us all.

     It's about creating positive ripples across time

                                      That add up to a pile that's tall.

   Every moment is an opportunity in its prime,

                                          So reach out and grab it now.

Meditate on feeling love and it will come to be.

                                                Can't do it? I'll show you how!

         In order to do so,                    I'll tell you a story about me:

                        It was seven years ago and I 

                   Thought I knew everything one could know,

                       But no matter how hard I'd try,
 
                 I couldn't make my life in any direction go.

                        Then one fateful spring night,

                While I was on a hit of the ol' psychedelics,

                I received one hell of a fright.

                Don't worry what it was, just know it did stick.

                My perceptions were distorted,

                Allowing me to see the divine in its entirety.

                My destroyed ego then contorted


                Into one that was full of an abundance of piety.


                               The moral of the story? Do drugs?

                  No silly, it's to have more novel experiences. 

                                One of them will give you a hug,

                      Which will help you stop being so serious.

                                 Then you can let go and embrace

                    The whole of the wisdom to you I am telling.

                     More people need to cuz we face

               A great set of tests on our planetary dwelling.

                         That is one reason I write,

                 But I also want to alleviate people's pain,

                          And stop every last fight.

               I care so much, I do this without financial gain.

                          Everyday I write my lessons

                   Guided by the hand of God who is my heart,

                        Hoping that entropy will lessen;

                This sort of pedagogy is none other than my art.

                         So now you know who I am,

                  Yet you only know one lesson of mine.

                      I have more if you're in a jam.
