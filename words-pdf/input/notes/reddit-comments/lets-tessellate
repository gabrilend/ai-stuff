R.I.P.

Rip City

Thanks for being so good to me

​

144? D.M.V.

Can I see I. D.?

Finally, ya’ll hear for the symphony!

​

I.O.P.

Intensive outpatient

Rolled on past the Devil’s sympathy

This shit is expensive without patience

Says the hospital when I heal all the patients

​

Did you foresee this going differently?

​

Space in your head

People payin’ rent for me

Why was it a surprise

You knew exactly how to tempt me

Space in your bed

No more thoughts of demise

Our people need the empathy

Of a Soul that’s full, not half empty

​

Supreme swag, hospitable with compliances

She’s seen Dad to the middle achieving self-reliance

From the trailer park to a rocket appliance

Living in my car to plugin to your rebel alliance

You know I am a star when I can relate God to science

I’ll build the divine comedy, you just have to finance

Talking about the past and our fine, slow dance

Medieval we will rock you, mounted with my lance

Knight’s tailing me, eying my Arthurian slants

This one’s built to last as I put on my pants

Drank the grail and proceeded on another rant

Sitting outside your house trying to remove the ants

​

Big boy’s do cry

So why does your girlfriend seem so dry?

I’ll make the rains come this July

Your humor is awful, oh my

​

Internal tribulation

Who needs to walk on water

When you can fly

Hard pills to swallow

​

Personal revelations

On the countertop

Fuckin’ America Pie

Hard act to follow

​

With my levitations

Floundering to flop

And this mark on my thigh

​

All this separation

Just makes me hotter

As I open the sky

​

Oil on the Nighthawks

Jack Harlow

Lighting my fry

Spoil me in my socks

Poppin’ off my rocks

Hittin’ all the corners

Because that’s my guy

​

How Soon is Now?

Linda, take off that shirt

Before they break up and I cry

Record skipping over lies

Wedding Singer broken

Singing I hope you die

Slinking behind the curtain

Laughing, He’s losing his mind

And the benefit is mine!

Like the whole world is sublime

​

Chris Cornell put me on the grind

Wide awake now till

The end of the time

Met him on the stairs

And now we dine

Some angels have more range

But he says

I’ll do just fine

​

Billy Idol tried to sing to me

But I was drunkin’ blind

At the fairground, trying to find

Love

Catholic girlfriend tried to bring it to me

Called her a Kunt instead of shined

A buddy said it’s like imitation crab

So it’s fine

The drink made me angry and I was a runt

On the inside

Her Mom told me the next day,

Jacob, don’t call your girlfriend a cunt!

I miss those simpler times

​

Don’t need a fuckin’ gun

But our last name may suggest it

Put it on a leather jacket

So haters can digest it

When I let loose with all this shit

I’ve had to respite

I’m about to be blastin’ my nine’s

Evangelicals are gonna detest it

You know everything is miiiiine

​

Six strings out of tune for this age

So I broke them all

Every time I was on stage

You just can’t believe it’s real this tiiiime

Shooting hoops times a thousand

You and me are still gonna sixty-niiiine

What’s the point of polarity?

If we can’t combiiiine

​

It’s how I get off, man

Along came Polly and my one chance

White chocolate like Philip Seymour Hoffman

Maybe even throw up a rain dance

These native spirits in me

Are capable of insane chants

But I ball so hard, singing Boston

Because it’s more than a feeling

And that’s awesome

​

One if by land, two if by sea

Revolution is coming

Led by you and me

​

The name reminded me

“of the Sea...”

So annoying, but I see…

But that’s why they call me

Bad Company

​

People are going to say

This gift is not even fair

Only thing I’ve had to pray

For is a head of white hair

King James’s personal revelation

I mean, I did pay their fare

I’m too full of myself for meditation

Or to care

​

Revelation 22:18 through 19

I don’t need handlebars

For my biking

Because I don't do that shit on Mars

On this path, I told you to start hiking

You’re gonna need a head start from

Lord of Lightning

Before the Thunder of my voice

Does all the striking

Thor, you’re just a Viking

With arrogance dialed to no one’s liking

Sucked in the gut, to appear more striking

Because thinking about half my people gone

Changes the tone of my typing

Me with all my shit together might be frightening

Bring forth complete Love instead of smiting

Wouldn’t that be a nice detour in my writing?

​

If you’re feeling this wait for the sequel

I gotta fuck with 50 for trying to talk like my equal

It’s all God’s plan I just had to spare Déagol

So America can skip to the end with a fuckin’ Eagle

Watch me do shit that shouldn’t even be legal

Dismiss Death and Taxes like I’m Evel Knievel

When I’m really just here to break the chains of my people

​

Strip naked and run through Mordor

Expose the truth behind Bipolar disorder

It has been used to disrupt order

And bring down the line of the Highest

Into something shorter

I'm definitely bais and this is a tall order

But if you struggle with mental illness

I'm here to open the potential for a new border

I've removed all the bequeathed prison warders

​

Here is the Church

Here is the Steeple

Open the Doors

And see all the People

Push the parson out the way

Get you up the Stairs

Because our bed is Regal

And we are going to show these people

Why the Universe wants to make our Power Illegal

​

If this sounds bad these people will just have to wait

So in love with myself, I might just run off to the lake

I love all the fire and the songs that it helps me make

I’m on my time with everyone and I am my favorite date

They’re back there tuning a harp and I keep bringing up rape

Meat puppets strumming as I seal my own fate

Just so I can watch myself when I am inspired to create

Distilling the life left in me to eliminate all the hate

​

Where did you sleep, hinting at the deadly

A Leadbelly to transmute to a gold medley

Shame alchemy, body double for Lena Headey

As my people go first up ahead of me

Stoned Jesus on the Mountain Grange of Headley

Plant a Stairway to Heaven one day, she led to me

All this beauty in my Mind, you shouldn’t have fed me

All of these hearts that so passionately bled me

Between the pines and what the land said to me

Ryan Gosling with tatts is what my ego read to me

​

Pennyroyal Tea, with Abraham Lincoln

Eat your copper mine up without thinkin’

See through surface illusions without blinkin’

Primal lust for what is stinkin’

Pepé Le Pew really on one this season

I wanna Space Jam too

Benched keeping my knee’s in

Shape to dunk of the World with ease ‘n

Solidify all unions and stop the drinkin’

Of the land and resources

Addiction to avoidance of the forces

Of the Soul and the pain that coarse

The vein of Man and outsources

The power that could be restored in

The Root of David’s corpses

​

That’s how I said

Goodbye to the Horses

You prepared such a fine Supper

All these lasting courses

Just so we can be equal but opposite

United forces

And the Root’s of my Kingdom

Are reborn before us

They whisper to me at night

Do not ignore us

When my sleeping children gain sight

That should shore us

In the hospital to make sure I am correct

Golden Eyed Russian, Invincible like Boris

Unsure about how all the compartments connect

A little frizzled on the tour bus

Docked to your apartment complex

I know this one sizzled

So give me a chorus

 - /u/First-chocolate_7187
