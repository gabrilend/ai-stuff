   Would it be more alright if you believed in the traditions of your
ancestors? Why or why not?

   The world today is very different than the mythic past. It's possible that
you share more with the people alive today than the people of the past - even
those who live on the opposite side of the globe.

   So to me it makes more sense to believe in the things that unite us all -
past, present, future. The most essential thing I can think of is our humanity,
and spirituality of all forms is inherently a celebration of that - what
divides us from the rest of the world if not our capacity for faith?

   A tree is alive, but trees just are - they exist and obey natural laws. An 
animal is alive, but it obeys it's instincts above all else. A human is alive, 
and a human can be so much more because they believe in their existence - I 
think, therefore I am. Put another way, I believe I exist because I think.

   So what unites all religions? All faiths and all mythologies? Only our 
humanity, that essential faith in ourselves. Sharing that with others is not a
crime, or a sin, and embracing the common experience can unite divided peoples.

   Have you ever wondered why religions often form after calamities? It's the 
shared experience that bonds people together. Just as a people feel the trauma 
of a painful collective experience, so too do they bounce back into a bright 
future of shared tradition. Animals don't do that, because they don't have wide
enough social nets to develop a feeling of living in a society together with 
others. Even animals who live in herds, packs, and other close knit 
"organizations" do so with reasons closer to family than society.

   I believe the development of all civilization is due to a chance occurrence
that united one of those "organizations" far in our distant past - 
specifically, the fact that we "conquered" the world. Truly, a marvelous fate, 
to be the animal that won the game of survival? But what a fleeting feeling, 
this thrill of accomplishment, as no victory is claimed by posterity. Just as 
the deeds of the father make way for the story of the son, so does time advance
- and with it fades the feeling of accomplishment.

   The people of that society, that global network of humans, living as a human 
should in plenty and pastoral celebration - are primed for another development.
Peace begets progress, and soon we have towns and then cities and then 
kingdoms. Follow this exponential curve of progression and you'll find yourself
in the present day - debating faith yet again as if it wasn't something we've
shared since the beginning.

   A culture cannot remain stagnant. It grows and changes every time it passes 
from mother to daughter, father to son. There's no use in slowing it's descent 
as the fundamental truth of our individualized experience ensures that no 
information can be transmitted 100% accurately.
   
   Therefore, religions change. They alter themselves in response to the
actions of their followers. Do you follow a religion of peace? Then it will 
beget peace in your life, and the lives of others. It's often worthwhile to ask
"what dangers has my religion caused? What actions of it's followers have
defined the way it is today?"

   If a culture cannot prevent itself from changing, and it's direction is 
defined by the actions of it's followers, and if every person swims in a 
cultural context that is also always changing, then wouldn't it make sense to 
steer that culture in a direction that suits you? To truly express yourself, 
you need control over your life and the world around you. (Happy people are
often self actualized for this reason) And if people don't have control over 
the direction of their culture because someone else is driving, then that's
going to make them pretty unhappy.

   So, cultural appropriation is bad. But sharing culture is good! Nobody is
born  with culture, they gather it from the world around them. So therefore
people cannot refrain from appropriating culture without completely isolating 
themselves from external influences. In it's most extreme form, solipsism,
which is even worse than atheism because it lacks faith in anything except the 
self.

   The solution is balance, between the internal beliefs and the external 
traditions. Steady yourself on the waves, and you can ride the current into the
future. Appreciate the culture of others, but realize they're riding a 
different current - if you assume too much of their patterns, beliefs, 
traditions, then you risk losing your own momentum.

   If you take anything at all, take the results and methods - see how they 
inspire themselves, how they thrive in the world, and find a way to instill
that feeling within yourself. Everyone's journey is different, so find your way
to shine. Be yourself and be essentially you, and wherever you find yourself is
where you're meant to be.

   Humans share our humanity. Surely we can build bridges between all else.
