[0] Here's an idea, an online multiplayer game that charges a 4$ per month subscription. 90% of which is set into a pool and used as tournament prize winnings. when you enter a tournament, it's free to participate and everyone wins something. (maybe calculated by percentile or something?) it's just a question of how much. [1][2][3][4]

- official just means "run by the company" because naturally the serverside code should be open source. how else would people build on it?

[1] in this way you'd sorta be giving a loan to the game's company (while also letting them take a 10% courtesy fee for keeping the official* servers running) which is then "spent" on exciting and friendly competition. Sorta like... entering a poker tournament with your friends (even though you suspect you might lose money) just because you like hanging out and playing cards. the money is just a neat way to keep things moving and exciting.


[2] players who played better should be compensated to a higher degree. no more than +/- 50-100% or so - this encourages players to "play their best" while also keeping the stakes relatively similar.

[3] at the start of the tournament the total prize money P in the pool is assigned to N performance tiers, where N is the Number of attendees. at the top, the highest performing athlete will receive 200% of P while the lowest performing performance tier will be 0%. It is a non-discrete and gradual linear transition.

[4] poor guy at the bottom of the stack. ah oh well, at least he's the only one. kinda makes me wonder if in some secret government lab there's like, a secret compound where they keep "the most miserable people in the land" and they just like... do horrible shit to them in order to increase the magnitude of their country's suffering. which, they believe, will increase the opposite of suffering as well, as you cannot bounce in a vacuum. sure would be terrible. I mean, we've sorta decentralized that. most of us go into work every day and that's often a difficult experience - not exactly miserable, but just like... not what we'd be wanting to be doing. hmmmmm did the founding fathers make the torment nexus on accident? whoops guess we'll never know
