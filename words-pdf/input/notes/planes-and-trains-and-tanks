From a thread titled "White House delays release of JFK assasination files "to protect against identifiable harm"

A violent uprising in America today would have the help of a lot of veterans that have 20 years of experience with insurgencies and are pissed off at the government for sending them to a bullshit war over lies purely so the politicians and their friends can become even richer.

True, but they have tanks. And drones. And much higher numbers of experienced soldiers. And a cohesive and organized command structure.

There's a hundred reasons why a violent uprising wouldn't work, but a thousand more why it's necessary.

I believe we can have a peaceful future, but we must also realize that holding all our cards and intentionally keeping them close to our chest isn't helping anyone. We need to come together and work on solid, stable, and sustainable projects. We're all humans, we all want a better future for our children. The drive to nurture posterity is what defines us, and to that end we must act as a unified whole.

Humans can work together, and our beliefs can overlap in ways we never expected. That is understandable and expected. They may also differ in unsuspected ways, and that is also understandable and expected. We have the power to *choose* how to react to our differences, and we may *choose* to pursue and develop our similarities.
