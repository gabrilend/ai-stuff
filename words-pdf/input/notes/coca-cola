by touch in the dark or
when lying broken on
the ground

slob-marley: You really have to wonder about people who would visit a Coca Cola
             museum. Like, is this sugar water such a touchstone in their lives?

ugathanki: Seems like it'd be worth the trip if you're interested in the growth
           and development of one of the world's largest companies. Why would it
           not be considered relevant information to the world? The story of
these companies is very important, because it predicts the favors of the 
company. Meaning it provides actionable, tactical advice for business owners to 
use to better their own companies. Essentially a knowledge sharing program - 
"hey look at our case study, we used these approaches and got that result" and 
all the various project managers and organizers and executives are like "neato" 
and they learn how to be better at their jobs. Because at the end of the day, if 
we all believe that it's better to be a good person than bad, we can all agree 
that it's better to be a "good" company than a "bad". Good and bad having 
different meanings, of course, compared to the human version. Because you cannot
expect two things of altogether unlike kinds to behave the same under the same
circumstances. It follows that the intense bureaucracy stifles rather than 
encourages good behavior. I mean think about it, we've had thought leaders for
generations who had ideas that would make the world better. But for a large part
many of them don't have their visions reflected in the world as accurately nor 
as perfectly as they required. So the task was passed onto the next, and as they
worked on together their future, was brighter than all that came before-yer, and
anyway we've got a lot to do.
