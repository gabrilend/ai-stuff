Okay I gotta go write some w7 but picture this: A computer program that emits
emotions during it's computing. Like "oh boy this process is going great!" and
sends that into a giant word cloud that represents the entire program. Wait,
scratch that, it's slowly filtered up through successive layers that provide
detail to different *parts* of a program. Like "Oh the image generation is going
great but it looks like the garbage collector is getting bogged down" - this
could provide lots of useful information that an AI language model could sift
through and filter into a batch of actually useful information. Think of it like
this - stuff as much context into the LLM's memory buffer and say "summarize
this in the same style. Make emphasis when necessary." the LLM could process all
that data and it could be filtered up until there's no unprocessed data and then
it could be given to the user in the form of a report or dashboard or something.
BOOM AI PRODUCTIVITY. The user will ask the AI to increase certain variables,
and it'll filter BACK DOWN THE CHAIN through the same exact process (just
backwards) this time) and then individual components will know how to behave.

Like imagine if your arms knew you were mad. They'd be much more likely to
punch stuff right? Or imagine if your legs knew you were scared. They'd probably
try and run as fast as they fucking can. There's an evolutionary reason why this
kind of technology would be useful, which means it's likely that it's part of
our genetic code. I mean, we have nothing to disprove it, but it's as good an
idea as any.
