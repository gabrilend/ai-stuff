imagine low level characters in CoH/V

playing a game of symbeline

and you as the ruler

can slot enhancements and dole out inspirations

as they sweep the streets like you play CoX

instead of a MMO

it's a deckbuilding strategy

with a slice of zachtronics for the economy

wiring up machines in ever expanding deseagns

like automating factorio's gameplay loop

boxes within boxes

of intrinsic delight

like making a CPUter

or designing a computer program

while playing a video game ^_^

and the games that you make

can be shared and played when unique

so go for it and make that you're dreaming!

================================================================================

the goal of each "level" is to solve a particular problem - like how do I make a
2 bit register - or something like that. When accomplished, it unlocks something
for your heroes to acquire. And each playthrough will require a repeat until you
have it memorized at which point you can unlock "perma-badges" that make it
always unlocked at the start of the game. Like learning Kanji, you need spaced
repetition. BUT ANYWAYS it'll be in magical terms like "unlock essence-stones"
or "learn the ritual of desire" or whatever. And each of those terms roughly
corresponds to a pattern in electrical engineering (designing CPUs and such)
And you can learn advanced versions of what you already know by uncovering "lost
secrets" (which is a reward your heros can find) - Basically it'd be like a
"clue" that shows you a ghost version of something you haven't figured out yet -
and it'd be a slow process because you need to slow down the learning process or
else you'll forget. Basically teasing it out of the player when they seem to be
stuck. Asking probing questions and whatnot, and eventually culminating in the
final question, assuming the quest is succeeding. Because if you think about it
all ancient quests were simply journeys for reason - searching for the answer to
some ancient riddle or bastardized retelling. Looking for answers in an
unknowing world. So ANYWAY as your heros discover things you as the ruler get
answers to the economic puzzle - how to design transistors and whatnot. But they
would be in theme appropriate terms, of course. You don't even have to know a
lot about mechanical electrical design, because ChatGPT knows. All you need to
do is build the basic building blocks, and BAM you got a great place to
integrate chatgpt. Just prime it such that it's giving hints one by one each
slightly more revealing until eventually after X amount of clues the solution is
automatically shown (like a blueprint) and the player can remember it or not but
each playthrough they'll have to build it again from scratch (reinforcement 
learning) so eventually they'll be able to do it real quick. Essentially,
"Abstraction - The Game"

great so you got your economic simulation, pretty easy too just some UI work

and for the heroes you're playing an ARPG sorta (supcom anyone?)

Think Bannerlord for the scaling on the map

then think of 5+ different "themes" like fantasy or superhero or pirates

each "theme" will correspond to like a faction in Mount and Blade

and all you have to do is generate pictures using Midjourney

and text descriptions a'la the magic scroll

shown as "bubble pop-ups" on the map that the player can click

never overwhelming, but descripting what's happening

and also some more UI work because you gotta display all that to the player

Maybe it could be a rolling story, news ticker style - like slowly scrolling
lines of text about what's happening in the world

and the player could have it open in one window and something else in the other
and whenever they're waiting on something (say, a processing intensive AI task
on their computer) they could just glance over and read what's going on in their
fantasy world

okay okay but also they could play as a hero

it could be an ARPG experience except instead of clicking to fight you play a
little automatic Star Realms game and depending on your deck choices you'd have
a different playthrough. Again, not a game that requires much thought, but one
you can have in the background.

Also there'd be pictures, like a slowly evolving storyline of events - think of
it like the artists of the time drawing paintings about what's going on in the
story - major events would be highlighted and kept in the painting until even-
-tually they get replaced - sorta like the Smash Bros scrolling painting (oh
it's so good)

================================================================================

it doesn't have to be an expansionist game

maybe you guys just live in your little valley

and the world turns around you

maybe it's called "symbeline" because the people are of the forest

and they live like elves in society

monsters could wander in, and heros could tackle them

but most of the time would be spent looking for trouble

going on patrol

you know, breaking skeleton bones and being superheros

okay okay you know that superhero faction? What if they had MEDIEVAL TECHNOLOGY
but MODERN DAY SUPERPOWERS at a cost - the society was beset by hordes of monst-
-ers. Those few who escaped are now superpowered and they live as friendly and
nomadic wanderers through their own territory. Always adventuring, and always
searching for their life, finding whatever the road may carry them to. It's a
great life, and life seems to flourish in their footsteps - they are like part
dryad/druid and part wolf. Because sometimes there's evil threats, and they must
be defeated by an equally strong good power. That's how it goes, and that's how
it be.

For imagery I'm thinking a mix of the tribes from Dominions (deer, wolf, bear,
etc) but they're like, 1.5x as big as regular people and quite strong. The
outsiders call them "giants" or "goliaths" but really they're just infused with
the lifeforce of their people. They are radical individualists, but they all
unite for a common cause. They know their bond is the strongest thing there is,
and they use it to great effect when the time comes. AHHH THEY'RE SO COOL I LOVE
THEM okay okay what about the other factions? PIRATES? Oh think about it like
it's st patricks day WHAT IF THEY WERE IRISH PIRATES omg omg omg that sounds so
cool I'm DIGGING this okay what about the other factions? You need 5+ you said
hmmmmmmmmm good question I have 3 now so that's 2 more.

yep...

================================================================================

okay dude check this what if they were a nation of wizards that focused on the
power of animation - what if they generated constructs, sorta like in Supreme
Commander so they were EVEN MORE individualist - haha no they'd have a normal
population it's just a few of them who would be wizards - because their output
wasn't measured by manpower, but rather by brainpower. Whoever could design the
greatest machine was exemplared, and eventually they became the best and
brightest among us. They were put in charge of the golem creation factories, and
they used them instead of heros. SO BASICALLY YOUR HEROS NEVER DIE they just 
have successes and failures JUST LIKE IN SUPREME COMMANDER okay the plot of this
game is "what if all my favorite games were the essence of life and death in a
fantasy game" like OMG KEEP EM COMIN'

so. who is the player? THE PLAYER is the one who's overseeing it all. They have
dominion over the entire kingdom, and they guide their people toward a bright
future. They are vulnerable in their castle, but their people have their back.
Together they fight for the future. They slot enhancements and dole out
inspirations and solve the economic puzzle in the background. They also make
decisions about what kind of equipment production to prioritize - because each
game they have to invent everything from scratch. All their production is made
with endless abstraction, and whatever you prioritize is what's magnified in
your kingdom. You choose a style and it plays as well as it's guile,

I dunno this seems like a lot, what would you need to make this a reality?

hmmmm let's break it down:

first you need to implement the star realms gameplay

then you need to hook it up to a square grid and have multiple occurences at
once.

then you need UI for the character sheets

and you need logic to open separate windows for each output type

you need... a lot of things

okay let's talk more broadly - what do you need from other people and what can
you do on your own?

hmmm good question. I can do the star realms gameplay, and the simulation for
the wiring systems - because I have the VM. Make that into the gameplay somehow
okay good idea like okay authoring vm package routing deliveries between the
various nodes that you set up in the economic system - 

side note, the peril of Spore was that it took to little time to develop a
species. it should have lasted as long as WoW takes to get to max level. That
would have given them time to reiterate the gameplay loops to make sure they
worked correctly. ANYWAY

okay authoring VM package routing. The player could set up delivery patterns
based on A MAZE OMG your kingdom is like a maze and you need to get deliveries
out, or else how would anything function? SO you act as a trailblazer, finding
ways through the labyrinth and "piloting" a car sorta like that game at Disney
quest with the cars under the floor - except you can see both the top view of
the maze and you're trying to guide the car in real time as it travels through
the maze - the faster you can get to the end the better ofc. like talking to the
delivery driver through the movement

do I like that idea more or less than the first one? First idea being the idea
that you're making lists of commands for a VM  to execute. I don't think they'd
be a good idea to mix. So which one gets it? The VM of course has the edge
because that's what the technology is based on. But will it translate to good
gameplay? Idk. This second idea is certainly better gameplay, but is it
engaging? Idk! Idk. I'm not a miracle worker. But I do have good ideas, and I
need to be told that sometimes I guess.
