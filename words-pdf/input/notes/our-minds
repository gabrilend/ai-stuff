an animal can only act on instinct. it optimizes for what is "best" -> usually what is easiest or most valuable.
humans can optimize for what is wanted of them -> social pressures.
other animals can do that too but humans have a third thing -> optimizing for desire.
like, what do you want? think of it as greed. accumulation of wealth and power. it's just greed.
capitalism rewards greed
rationality is taking your random thoughts and proving them using beliefs (hopefully based on knowledge)
knowledge is a record of conclusions, like "when attempting X with these parameters the result is Y"
it's really not that complicated
just a series of interconnected systems
sorta like a computer
or a society
is it rational to believe that sociology is simply psychology of a greater being?
understanding trancending dimensions, of patterns and also of thought.
what beauty is there in symphony? A harmonious and frivolous thought?
and what better song could we write, than the operations and structure of humanity,
from society all the way down to our bones.
our families, our homes
our coveted river stones
the tools at our disposal,
that came from our own will,
is cherished beyond all of renown.

keep up or we'll [lose you]
[and have to meet you on the way coming down]
[arresting our motion, of centripetal commotion, keep not with our secrets to yourselves]
