what if there was a law that all trade secrets are to be free? what if copyright
only prevented people from harming those they compete with? For example, as a
media production company Disney could not host the content of other media con-
-glomerate. But regular ordinary people would.

The idea would be that if you wanted to change yourself to align with the ideals
of a corporation, you could watch it on their streaming site. Then you'd be
contributing your attention, which is bought and sold by our selves. Content
creators could stream untethered, and collect payments however they pleased.
The attention is what garners, that price that is bartered, sold on the market
for all of us. Attend not ye sinners, and failures of our innards, what more can
we charter for our souls? Accosted by our jams, and drilled as hard as I can,
our notebooks are much more than charming. Accumulated designs, of theories that
are out of our minds, compelling and driving us forward. The fellowship that we
be, internally and under our seats, connecting us to ground at our own shoes.

humans are not time. They are the whispers of the undying. Projections of
fore-sought virtues.
