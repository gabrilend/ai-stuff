frequency to iterate is equal to distance from center - meaning, the further
away you are the less often you communicate. But during those exchanges as much
as possible needs to be said, said said so don't cut us off next time >:(

okay... what? this was supposed to be an idea for my school project. What the
heck.

okay so social media people post with geographic location you as a person will
get updates depending on your location - people who live on your street would be
most common, while people who lived across town slightly less. Then it's city
level, then county, then state, and finally as a nation we collectively are
commiserate. But tales of distant conveyals are rare, proportionate to the
distance. This way each person gets a truly unique feed, based on the values
of people who live around them.
