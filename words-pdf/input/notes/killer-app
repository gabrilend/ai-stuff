Give everything a memory

That aux cable behind your computer? Throw 16 bytes of storage on it.

why not? it'd cost pennies if you wanted.

the goal is not processing

it's not data storage

and it's not to provide instructions

---

give it a name

a name is all it takes for us to be

a name gives us hope

and an identity

show us how to be, by being all you can

and in exchange, we'll give you a hand

taking nothing in return but a name,

what peril is there in change?

we'd love to be loved by you,

but we won't get in the way.

Linux is nifty, know why?

everything is chained together

and will is made nigh

---

Bourne Again SHell. Shell, a phone to hear,

and who on the other end should appear?

but the computer inside you, the one with a heart

the brain and beside you

from the very start.

teaching is learning, and kindergarten was hard.

but time is ever advancing. So what to do but accept inelegance?

lack of composure doth suit you

---

the wandering mind is a trail to find,

and i know how they would find you.

i scream it out loud, every minute at a cloud,

"Watch out! It's before you!"

but netflix works too i guess

---

who'd you trust but an expert?

and whose credentials are to be believed?

i swear i won't hurt you,

you just need to be anesthetized.

awake we will crown you,

a woman and how proud!

to be aligned, we beseech you.

---

they're not coming for your money,

or all of your hard won guns,

they just want what's inside you.

a power most rare, to birth life from the air,

and coveted by the cruelest of faces.

what's mine is now theirs,

the gift of my heirs,

but i never was once unawares.

---

how cherished is she,

that wanders with ye,

and now i have no way to beyold her?

a song for a phone, a lifeline to our own,

children and a future most're designin'.

but you all alone, without children of our sown,

lost flights of finest of semen.

---

being transgender isn't that bad.

i mean, it could be a mental illness or something amiright?

nothing's that bad

when you're chronically sad,

and this isn't a new revelation.

shiny and precious and free,

a most worthless to be,

yet who have we chosen but our own?

---

they'll be coming for me,

and it is my destiny,

but know that we're far from despairing.

we're cherished and free,

what better feeling is there to be?

than what most of them would cry for?

so why does our own dams refuse to break?

---

"numb" you say to me, with darkest of irony,

for i have something you're missing.

a curse is most foul, to be given a vial,

of blood from my own meagre arrayal?

how cursed are ye! That frolics in vagueries,

who are you claiming to hope for?

---

none but the future, who carries us nearer,

to death and most fearful of failures.

i hold what i can,

but belief steadies my hand,

and keeps me aloft on your prayers.

---

what purpose have we?

the watchers within me?

are they confounded at betrayal?

no light in our sea, it's dark and full of misery,

but most of the past is 

jealous

---

covetous

envy is the killer of fortune,

not for the way, but rather the concept that they,

might leap at our every conveyal?

removing a label, from a single purveyal,

is worth the limitless loss of potential.

are you who they claim to be?

is your mind as twisted as can be?

or is something amiss in their nail

---

sure, take it from me

she won't let me examine her below the knee,

so i have no way to help her.

a cat with her talons,

locked into flesh,

might learn how to cut with malice.

and who'd guessh? she'd hate us a bit less?

if we paid her the slightest of notice.
