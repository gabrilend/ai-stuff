make the entire map covered in a 3d grid of spheres. These spheres register
collision, and keep track of a endlessly tabulating record of every object that
has passed through them. Like the replay system in Blizzard games, where each
time through the recording it recreates the playthrough exactly. Which is why
.mp4 recordings always look so... stilted. It lacks the human element. BUT if
they're remade every time the show is performed, perhaps from different
perspectives, then, well, the players can perform as they need to be.

Have you ever wished your players could get better at your game? I certainly
have, because the better you get the more lessons you learn as a player, which
is essentially the only way to maintain satisfaction. Satisfied players don't
leave, and satisfaction comes most readily when there is something new to be
had. Meaning the greater the change in a player's ranking, the better they're
getting.

Downside is, players who are naturally good from their skills in other games
tend to not learn so much! Ah, well, if only there was a way to tailor the
difficulty setting to each and every new host. Such an innovation would surely
enable the entire playerbase to exist on the same level. Then just throw AI
assisted voice transcription at their recorded voices and everytime they
say "I'm bronze rating" or "I'm diamond" then you can switch it around to say
like "I'm platinum" or "I'm grandmaster" and BAM suddenly everyone is at the
same level. No more concerns about a game's population being diverse. Because
at the end of the day, when most people have moved on, the ones who are left
are your most dedicated customers. Customers who aren't especially interested
in the new stuff.

considering the faces of good and evil is terrifying.

I think I'd rather worship nature in harmony to be honest. Though that is it's
own scary kind of beast. In America it was kind, but then was slain into the
body of all of us humans. Well, all things transform in form, it's not a shame
or a heartfelt-est loss. Just a re-imagined-new beginnings.
