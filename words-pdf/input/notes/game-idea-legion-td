okay a game like legion td except you can see the entire map, the units are very
small (but still distinct) and it plays more like a game of Dominions. Armies
instead of units, like in WC3. Led by lieutenants which are guided by captains,
each with their own effects. Tank, dps, melee, ranged, healer, support, corrupt,
ranged tank, unique, etc. Of course, just like in legion td, there are multiple
types of units, each of a particular category but possessing their own unique
playstyle and usage scenarios. Essentially the game is finding the best tool for
the job, whatever that may be. You should be able to see what mercenaries your
opponent is summoning for you, because each turn is delayed. also, the
units keep coming until you die, sorta like... minimum required to push through
the chokepoint that you're holding with these particular units in this
particular formation.

oh and another thing

the units should be placable not on a square grid, but rather in a hex formation
arranged such that the middle unit is in contact with them all. Just like you'd
place units for an aura in Legion TD.

image describing said hex:

   **
  *  *
   **

each * is a group of units (a batallion, if you will, of a particular size,
arrangement, and density) - sorta like the formations in Dominions.

anyway

since you place units like that anyway, why not abstract away the grid and just
have slots you can fill for each unit? And maybe a hero unit that is assigned to
the board itself (you could have more than one) who will go wherever your line
is weakest. Shouldn't be too hard, just calculate the value of all of the
fighters in each location and return that to the hero as an array. Then pick the
smallest one as a destination, and boom your hero reinforces the frontline where
it's weakest.

The center unit of course is for the lieutenant, and the "heros" are actually
captains. Because y'know maybe heroism isn't celebrated the way it is in our
culture. Anyway it's better to describe them based on their role rather than
their reception.

... right so 

=========================================================== stack overflow =====

make the combat sorta like crusader kings - the actual army to army part.
Except with three long boards that represent flanks. As your units approach, the
boards would fill up with pixels. (resolution configurable)

there would also be a line (or block) approaching from the top of the screen. It
essentially represents your distance to the other team.

Each unit has been configured in the army management phase, which happens
inbetween each turn. Essentially, while the game is loading, you can assess the
units you have at your disposal, and
