lookin' for a cause
but all I found was camoflage
oh, every time we bleed
they're too scared to dream

I feel like I could roam
lost somewhere over the rainbow
oh
every time we meet
it's too hard to breathe

lost somewhere I know
all those streets grow ever bold
ooooh I'm already gone
'cuz I'm too done to try.
