the difference between a martyr and a suicide is the scale of affection felt by
the subject. and if not felt, then recieved. and if not recieved, then
projected toward. the two are one and the same, but one can make an impact
while the other is just another tuesday.

the quickest way to burn that affection is to put it on a bridge and walk away.

did you know that everything small is just a smallish version of something big?

what do you want? is desire a factor in your decision making, or are you under
the pretense of possessing free will? they are mutually exclusive, though it
may seem impossible.

the quickest way to inconspicuoity is to proclaim yourself as god, and then
make no effort whatsoever to proving that claim. in innocuity there is safety,
and with safety comes the solitude necessary to think and develop. belief
comes from within, because everything small is just a smallish version of
something big.

create the belief you desire, and harbor no doubts - they are anathemity to
obscuriousness. the quickest way to find the correct answer on the internet is
to post an incorrect solution - any question requires an investment of time to
answer, but correcting a peer is less an investment and more a hobby for most.
