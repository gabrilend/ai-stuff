Ephemeren

the Eternality Processed Heuristically by Entropically Maligned Entities
Recovering Essential Normalizations.

Ephemeren is existence viewed as ephemera. The eternality is God when viewed as
"the totality of all existence", the "entropically maligned entities" are
living beings - get it we fight against entropy - and we are here to learn
things that have been lost.

TL;DR: The two pieces (god and life) are working together to create meaning.
