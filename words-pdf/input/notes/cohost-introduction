Hi,

I'm Ritz Menardi.
I'm a witch, so I'm strange and wear a funny hat.

I like colors in the dark, poetry from the heart, and scary songs about society.
I think of myself as a synecdoche for humanity, and though I'm not always right
I try to be aligned when possible. Most people I've found aren't really like me.

I am as I am, and
I promise,
I won't hurt you.
