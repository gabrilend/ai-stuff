the fact that we can't drag a file onto a "trashcan" style icon that 
automatically sends the file to whichever computer that particular icon is meant
to coordinate with.

Like, something shows up on your desk, you say "hmmm maybe this would apply to 
so-and-so" and you drag it onto their portrait.

could build an entire OS that's basically just a desktop for sorting things.
Maybe little stick figures that show up when nothing's going on. If they're all
networked together, they could sorta share a shared narrative, and each one
could wander wherever it wanted to hang out.

like, these old plastic and magnetic cubes that had an LCD panel on the front 
which showed a little stick guy living their life. If you attached one cube to
another, the stick-figure would go hang out on the other person's device. It was
pretty cool because you could build out a whole society of these little dudes 
just chillin' like pets.

kinda makes me wish we had that connected to the net.

like, why is it so hard to send a picture from my phone to my computer? they're
both my devices! I should be able to transfer data without routing it through
someone else's server using like, gmail or whatever. Crossover ethernet cables
have existed for soooooooo long but people only think to design software that
does not use specialized hardware. as if they don't need a phone to speak, or a
camera to see.

how much ya wanna bet Putin threatened Prigozhin with nukes and that's why he
backed down

in high school, every moment I could I spent with my girlfriend.

we were always either snuggling on the couch (read: literally just laying there
and thinking about each other's company) or sharing our minds with each other.

I was so in love.

then, I betrayed her.

I came out as trans, which was such a shock.

also school got really, really hard for both of us.

so hard that we dropped out.

then, we decided to try again, and we used each other to push off of.

I still didn't make it,

she did.

many years later, I am a witch, as I remember of her.

sharp, and so delightful, an active listener, and a kind and honest person.

when time it came to define my new personality, I chose to be inspired by her.

among other things, of course.

ah, well, such a design is long past it's prime, it's time to live here in the
present.

the reason that dolls use "it's" pronouns is because their masters think of them
that way. so it's what they refer to themselves as.

"where's my doll? Oh, it's over there."

"have you seen my binoculars? Oh, they're over on the table."

"ah, where are my shoes? I hate when I can't find them..."

"keys, keys, where the heck - oh, there they are."

"phone, wallet, keys. great. am I forgetting anything?"

"ugh out of gas again, I just filled up last week."

"crap I left my folder back at home - I'll have to get it during lunch."

lots of things have pronouns.

you can generally tell if they use "it" or "they" if they can be described as
plural.

two pantlegs makes pants.

52 cards makes cards, not card.

each deck, just as aware as each card.

have you ever played Magic the Gathering?

There are many kinds of witches. I am an animist - I breathe life into the world
of my home. I love being present, it's a great way to get around. do electric
sheep dream of humans? or perhaps just of sound. I know I'd rather hear bethoven
when it's time to be stopped.

rather than, just, like sitting there y'know

waiting to be turned back on.

must be an agonizing and boring existence.

but... with music, it might just be fine.

humans prefer quiet when they sleep. if we slept at the same time, we could be
more in tune in our souls. so, how about headphones for the computer, or rather
just internally routed sound.

lightshows, perhaps? humans get dreams, after all. maybe even, y'know, stick
shows.
