okay how about that idea that I had before [delete this line and replace with idea] but instead of a pdf it's an html document
[for context, the original wasn't saved when I turned my computer off]
[how lame]

anyway okay so what if there was an HTML document that had all the poems in
chronological order. Then, if you clicked a poem (ANY poem!) then it took you to
a page that had all the poems above a certain threshold sorted by similarity
(as determined by the EMBEDDINGS comparison created through Ollama)

so, if you're interested in knowing more, here's a bunch of related poems
there'd also be a link at the top to take you back to the chronological sorting
it could be displayed similarly to the PDF (which is primarily for printing)
so that it looks aesthetically pleasing.

all the HTML pages would be generated beforehand and stored on the server.
since it's just text and some basic color graphics, it's fine and shouldn't take
much hard drive space.

however, since there's a new page generated for EACH poem, and since there's
400+ pages of poems, each with sometimes at least 6-10 poems... there might be
around 4000 pages, each of which must be pre-computed beforehand. We need to
create some excellent TESTING processes and ensure that the output is correctly
produced BEFORE we do the intense processing tasks which cannot be parallelized.
