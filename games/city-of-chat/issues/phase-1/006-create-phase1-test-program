# Issue 006: Create Phase 1 Test Program

## Current Behavior
No test program exists to demonstrate Phase 1 completion and validate all deliverables.

## Intended Behavior
A comprehensive test program that validates all Phase 1 deliverables and demonstrates the successful completion of environment setup and basic server compilation.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Create test script directory structure
2. Write tests for development environment validation
3. Create source code presence and integrity checks
4. Add compilation verification tests
5. Include basic server startup validation
6. Create summary report generation
7. Make the test program executable with a simple bash script
8. Document test program usage and interpretation
