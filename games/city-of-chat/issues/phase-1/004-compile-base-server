# Issue 004: Compile Base Server

## Current Behavior
Source code exists but has not been compiled into working server binaries.

## Intended Behavior
Successfully compiled City of Heroes server binaries that can be executed, with documentation of the build process and any modifications needed.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Read and follow existing build instructions
2. Install any missing dependencies identified during compilation
3. Resolve compilation errors and warnings
4. Document any modifications needed for successful compilation
5. Create automated build scripts
6. Test that compiled binaries can execute without errors
7. Document the complete build process for future reference
