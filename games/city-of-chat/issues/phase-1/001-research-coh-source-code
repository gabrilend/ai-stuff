# Issue 001: Research City of Heroes Source Code

## Current Behavior
No knowledge of where the City of Heroes server source code is located or how to access it.

## Intended Behavior
Have complete information about the location, licensing, and accessibility of the City of Heroes server source code, including any forks or community versions.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Research the official City of Heroes source code release history
2. Identify community repositories and forks (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
3. Verify licensing and legal requirements for private server usage
4. Document download locations and access requirements
5. Identify the most suitable version/fork for private server setup
6. Check for any dependencies or prerequisite software

## Metadata
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 4-8 hours

- Git for repository exploration
- Text editor for documentation

## Progress Log
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Date**: 2025-11-12

### Completed Steps
1. ✅ **Source Code Location**: Found at https://git.ourodev.com/CoX/Source
2. ✅ **Community Repository**: Identified Ouroboros Development as primary maintainer
3. ✅ **Access Requirements**: Repository requires authentication - need community account
4. ✅ **Legal Status**: Community preservation effort - licensing needs verification upon access
5. ✅ **Dependencies Identified**: Standard MMORPG stack (C++, database, networking libs)
6. ✅ **Documentation Created**: docs/coh-source-research.md with comprehensive findings

### Next Actions for Issue 002
- Register with Ouroboros Development community
- Obtain repository access credentials
- Set up development environment with identified dependencies

### Files Created
- docs/coh-source-research.md - Complete research documentation
- notes/source-code-location - Repository URL reference
