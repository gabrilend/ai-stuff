# Issue 005: Basic Server Validation

## Current Behavior
Compiled server binaries exist but have not been validated for basic functionality.

## Intended Behavior
Confirmed working server that can start up, initialize basic systems, and shut down cleanly without requiring full database or client connections.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Create basic server configuration files
2. Attempt server startup with minimal configuration
3. Verify server initialization process completes
4. Test graceful server shutdown
5. Check log files for errors or warnings
6. Document any configuration requirements
7. Create validation scripts for future testing
