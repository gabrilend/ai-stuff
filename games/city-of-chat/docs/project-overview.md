# City of Chat - Private City of Heroes Server Project

## Overview

This project aims to set up and customize a private City of Heroes server using the available C++ source code. The goal is to create a fully customizable gaming experience with supporting tooling for game-related projects.

## Objectives

1. Download and install the City of Heroes server source code
2. Set up a functional private server environment
3. Enable full customization capabilities through C++ modifications
4. Build necessary tooling for game administration and development
5. Create a framework for future game-related projects

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: C++ (primary server code)
- **Platform**: Linux-based server environment
- **Build System**: TBD (to be determined based on source code structure)
- **Database**: TBD (likely PostgreSQL or MySQL based on CoH requirements)
