# City of Heroes Source Code Research

## Source Code Location
**Primary Repository**: https://git.ourodev.com/CoX/Source

## Background
City of Heroes was an MMORPG that shut down in 2012. The source code was later made available to the community through various channels, with Ouroboros Development (ourodev.com) being a primary maintainer of the codebase.

## Repository Information
- **Host**: git.ourodev.com
- **Organization**: CoX (City of X)  
- **Repository**: Source
- **Type**: Git repository
- **Access**: Requires authentication (username/password or token)
- **Clone Command**: `git clone https://git.ourodev.com/CoX/Source.git`

## Legal Status
- The source code availability appears to be through community preservation efforts
- **Status**: Needs verification of licensing terms and legal usage rights
- **Recommendation**: Review any license files in the repository before proceeding

## Community Ecosystem
- **Primary Community**: Ouroboros Development
- **Wiki**: https://wiki.ourodev.com/
- **Development Discussion**: Likely on community forums/Discord

## Access Requirements
- **Authentication Needed**: Repository requires login credentials
- **Community Membership**: May need to register with Ouroboros Development community
- **Alternative Access**: Check if there are public mirrors or forks available

## Next Steps for Issue 001
1. ✅ Locate source code repository
2. 🔄 Obtain access credentials for git.ourodev.com
3. 🔄 Clone and examine repository structure  
4. 🔄 Review licensing and legal documentation
5. 🔄 Identify build requirements and dependencies
6. 🔄 Document setup procedures

## Immediate Actions Required
- Register account with Ouroboros Development community
- Request repository access if needed
- Explore community forums/Discord for setup guidance

## Typical Dependencies (To be verified once source is accessed)
Based on typical MMORPG server requirements, expect:

### Build Tools
- **C++ Compiler**: Visual Studio (Windows) or GCC/Clang (Linux)
- **Build System**: Likely CMake, Make, or Visual Studio solutions
- **Git**: For version control

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**: For game data storage
- **Database Client Libraries**: libpq, mysql-client

### Networking
- **Network Libraries**: Boost.Asio or similar
- **SSL/TLS**: OpenSSL for secure connections

### Utilities  
- **Python/Perl**: For build scripts and tools
- **Compression Libraries**: zlib, potentially others
- **Logging**: Custom or standard logging frameworks

## Platform Considerations
- **Primary Target**: Likely Windows (original platform)
- **Linux Support**: Community may have Linux ports
- **Architecture**: x64 preferred, check for legacy x86 dependencies

## Notes
- Repository URL provided in notes/source-code-location
- Access to git.ourodev.com may require specific network access or community membership
- Should verify if this is the most current/maintained fork
- Dependencies list will be confirmed once source code is examined
