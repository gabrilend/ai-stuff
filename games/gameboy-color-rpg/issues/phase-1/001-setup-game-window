# Issue #001 - Setup Game Window

## Current Behavior
No game window or rendering context exists.

## Intended Behavior  
Create an HTML5 Canvas-based game window that renders at modern resolutions while maintaining GBC-authentic asset scaling and presentation.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Create WebAssembly module with Canvas context binding
2. Initialize canvas from WASM at higher resolution (e.g., 800x720 or 1280x720)
3. Implement scaling system in WASM for GBC-sized assets (5x-8x scaling)
4. Set up WASM-based game loop with requestAnimationFrame callback
5. Create WASM-JS interface for Canvas2D context operations
6. Test canvas rendering performance from WebAssembly

## Technical Requirements
- **Canvas Resolution**: 800x720 minimum (5x scale) up to 1280x720 (8x scale)
- **Asset Scaling**: Integer scaling of 8x8 and 16x16 GBC tiles/sprites implemented in WASM
- **Frame Rate**: 60 FPS with WASM game loop calling requestAnimationFrame
- **WASM Interface**: Exported functions for canvas operations and input handling
- **Responsive**: Canvas scaling handled by WASM coordinate system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Window opens at correct resolution
- [ ] Scaling works properly on different display sizes  
- [ ] Game loop runs at stable 60 FPS
- [ ] Window can be closed properly
- [ ] No rendering artifacts or distortion
