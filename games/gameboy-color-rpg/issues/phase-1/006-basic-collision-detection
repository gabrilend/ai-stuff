# Issue #006 - Basic Collision Detection

## Current Behavior
No collision detection system exists.

## Intended Behavior
Implement a web-optimized collision detection system using efficient JavaScript algorithms suitable for higher resolution gameplay with GBC-style movement.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Create WASM collision data structures in linear memory
2. Implement WASM AABB collision detection with SIMD optimization
3. Add WASM spatial partitioning using grid-based lookup system
4. Create WASM tile collision system with coordinate space handling
5. Implement WASM sprite collision with efficient broadphase/narrowphase
6. Add WASM collision debugging with Canvas rendering interface
7. Optimize WASM collision algorithms for 60 FPS with many entities

## Technical Requirements
- **WASM Performance**: Native-speed collision algorithms in WebAssembly
- **Memory Layout**: Efficient collision data organization in linear memory
- **SIMD Support**: Vector operations for batch collision testing
- **Spatial Optimization**: WASM-based grid or quadtree implementation
- **Debug Interface**: WASM functions for collision visualization data

## Collision Categories
- **Solid**: Walls, obstacles that block movement
- **Trigger**: Doors, items, interaction zones
- **Character**: Player and NPC collision boundaries
- **Attack**: Combat hitboxes (future phase)

## Technical Implementation
- **AABB Detection**: Fast rectangle-based collision
- **Spatial Partitioning**: Grid-based optimization for large worlds
- **Collision Masks**: Different collision types per object
- **Response System**: Configurable collision responses
