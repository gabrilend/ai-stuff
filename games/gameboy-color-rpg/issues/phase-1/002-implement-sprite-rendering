# Issue #002 - Implement Sprite Rendering System

## Current Behavior
No sprite rendering capabilities exist.

## Intended Behavior
Create a Canvas2D/WebGL sprite rendering system that uses authentic GBC-sized sprites but renders them at higher resolution with crisp scaling.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Define sprite data structures in WASM memory (position, source rect, scale)
2. Implement WASM sprite rendering functions with Canvas2D bindings
3. Create WASM sprite batch system with memory-efficient sorting
4. Load authentic GBC sprites into WASM linear memory with integer scaling
5. Implement layered rendering system entirely in WASM
6. Optimize WASM sprite operations for 100+ sprites per frame
7. Test sprite rendering performance from WebAssembly

## Technical Requirements
- **Sprite Sources**: Authentic 8x8 and 16x16 pixel GBC sprites in WASM memory
- **Rendering Scale**: 5x-8x integer scaling implemented in WASM
- **Performance**: WASM batch rendering for 100+ sprites without JS overhead
- **Memory Layout**: Linear memory organization for efficient sprite data access
- **WASM Exports**: Sprite rendering functions callable from JS

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Can load and display basic sprites
- [ ] Palette system works correctly
- [ ] Sprite count limitations enforced
- [ ] Per-scanline sprite limits enforced
- [ ] Sprite priority system functional
- [ ] No visual corruption or artifacts
