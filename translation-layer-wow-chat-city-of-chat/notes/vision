currently, there are two major massive multiplayer online games.
City of Heroes, and World of Warcraft.

I wonder if a translation layer may be made, as a computer program, that read
the data from the WoW client, then sent it to the CoH server and back?

the other way too, the convex, from CoH client to and fro WoW server.

this translation layer would use LLM generated code, scripted on the fly and
tuned to feel like it "just works", in the style of wow-chat, guiding the
narrative of the players.

Blood Elves in the Rogue Isles

Tauren exploring Blackfathom Deeps

Horse-shield cavalry with Crey bionic weaponry

"giving warhorses arms and machetes? what could go wrong!"

I would love to play a Mastermind in Outland

maybe I could have whatever kind of minions I want

[whatever came about in the story, DM'd by the collective DM spirit, trained on
 all of the DMing in the world]

can you imagine flying through Naxxramas like a floating [mirror/chandelier/tapestry/crystal-oddity]
lots of space.

[getting off track, refocus]

ah right okay so the Rogue Isles is all about various competing gang-groups who
live there in conflict. There's some islands that have the baddest of the bad,
and they keep each other sharp. The Mercy Island is for everyone too low to
even beg.

as they rise through the ranks, they are charted and plotted by Arachnos

watching from the peripherary as you learned from their villain-omics.

I'm picturing a "CoH expansion mk. 3" that's just the setting of honnouji -
- academy. with the elements of Avatar the last airbender via CoH units and
  WoW mechanics.
