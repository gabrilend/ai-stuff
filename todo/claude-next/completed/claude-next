hi, some of the Anbernic devices in the tech-deployment-pipeline.md file in
/notes/ are Android devices, but this software is only designed to run on Linux.
Can you go through and do some research and figure out which handhelds run Linux
and update the tech deployment pipeline documentation to only include devices
which are Linux devices?
