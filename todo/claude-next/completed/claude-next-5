hi, can you help me analyze this repository and create a presentation for
various companies or groups of people who might be interested in it? I'm
hoping for several different documents, each tailored to a specific audience.
It should highlight the unique aspects of the system, without using flowery
language or telling the audience how to feel about it. They should be taken by
the wonder of the joy of technology itself, and less so the way we choose to
describe it. Anyone who doesn't understand why the technology isn't useful will
probably not be interested in it, but those who would be interested will
instantly be convinced of it's utility as soon as they understand it. So walk
them through it gracefully, but don't try too hard to sell it to them.

you can save these in /examples/presentation-docs/.

The intended recipients are:

Nintendo, to publish or invest in a company creating 3rd party devices which
fit into their product catalogue. For this audience we should de-emphasize the
emulation capabilities (unimplemented) and instead focus on the streetpass style
method of exchanging emails and Scuttlebutt data, while also having the
form-factor and design that enables video games to be played easily.

Anbernic, to offer a unique software solution that sells their devices in ways
that go beyond being emulation platforms. It should focus on the open source
nature of the software, emphasizing that any developments would be built with
their cooperation and are intended to be utilized for any of their products as
they please.

Anthropic, to say "hello here is how I use your tools, would you like to hire me
as a consultant or employee or something, I've been using them for like a week
and this is what I've learned"

My friends, who I'll need to explain the device to before we can use it for some
awesome fun hangout parties. I should also try and explain why they should buy
their own anbernics because I only have like... 2. I'd like to emphasize the
communication possibilities, and the encryption capabilities as well. Though
keep in mind this audience won't be a technical group.

Nvidia, as a spiritual successor to their Nvidia shield portable handheld
console device. This should emphasize the mesh network capabilities and the
ability to utilize the devices for scalable operations, with a vision of being
able to use them for decentralized compute tasks in the future. As a company
that specializes in GPU processing which is largely parallel, they may be
interested in such aspects of the devices.

My girlfriend, who I'll need to explain why I'm spending so much time working on
this and how important it is that we snuggle during the windows when the 5 hour
limit has been reached and I am unable to progress aside from writing vision
documents like this. It should emphasize the ways in which she can help and also
the ways that she is so so pretty and cute and how I want to spend a bunch of
time with her and make out sloppy lesbian style. Also it should remark on her
cooking skills and how tasty the food she makes is at least 3 times over the
course of the presentation, and highlight how soft her skin is and how much her
boobs are perfect for burying my face within.

If there are any other companies which seem interested, please write a 
presentation document for them as well. I am a decent orator and I have family
in business so I will be able to be guided and tutored by them for the 
presentation process. I want to make this project a reality, and I'm willing to
write it from scratch if I have to. I'm proud of the work I've done in the
pre-production sprint with the AI assisted tools, but I am under no illusions as
to my capabilities and the capabilities of my computer-generated code. I know
that I will need to hire developers, ideally those with embedded experience, and
I know that I will need to let them take the lead. My role is primarily for the
vision, the direction, and the coordination. I like to call myself a
techno-witch, but really that essentially translates to a junior developer and a
frequent vibe coder, as witches are known to call to spirits and encourage them
to undertake tasks as they see fit.
