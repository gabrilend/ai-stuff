I want to begin testing the system. Can you create a simple application with a
Portmaster configuration setup ready to go which tests the radial keyboard
functionality? It should be able to be deployed manually to the system, without
going through their online repository. Then, it should be run through the
Portmaster functionality. The goal is simply to test the capabilities and
ergonomics of the radial keyboard.

The radial test and all associated files (such as config and Portmaster files)
should be placed in /examples/portmaster/keyboard-test/

The /examples/portmaster/keyboard-test/ directory should contain the docs and
associated files. It should include an application that can be run within
Portmaster from any Anbernic device. This application should function as follows

First, there should be a blank screen with a small white circle in the center.
Then, when one of the directional pad buttons are pressed, it should open a
small, arc-shaped menu on the outside edge of the circle which offers four
options. They should be arranged clockwise, with the first option being on the
left (earlier in the clockwise clock shape) and the final option being on the
right (later in the clock). They should be positioned such that the middle of
the arc (after the first two options and before the last two options) is at the
cardinal direction pointed to by the pressed directional pad buttons. If the
user moves their thumb to a different direction and pushes a different button
on the D pad, the first menu should close and another one should open at the
new direction.

For example, if the user pushes the LEFT arrow, the first two options should be
radiating outward such that they are below the X axis, while the next two
options should be oriented above the X axis. If the user pushes the UP and RIGHT
buttons, the LEFT arrow button arc-shaped menu should close, and the UP/RIGHT
menu should open. The UP/RIGHT menu is positioned at a 45 degree angle between
the positive X and Y axises, such that the first two options are between the
45 degree angle and the Y axis, and the second two options are between the 45
degree angle and the X axis.

The contents of the buttons inside the radial arc-shaped menu should be the
letters of the alphabet. If the user pushes L1 or X, the first button should
be pressed. If they push L2 or B, the second button should be pressed and the
letter associated displayed in the center of the circle. If they push R1 or A,
the third button should be pressed and the associated letter displayed in the
center of the circle. If they push R2 or Y, the fourth letter should display.

If there are any empty slots, they should be left empty for this test. There
should be enough space for every letter and some empty spots.

Please use the radial keyboard module functionality of the project as much as
possible. If the radial keyboard module is not implemented according to these
guidelines, if the implemented design is incongruent with what is presented
here, then write a note in the /issues/ directory and explain the issue,
referencing this /todo/claude-next/claude-next-6 file inside the issue.
