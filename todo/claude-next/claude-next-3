hi, can you go through the documentation for the project and search for parts of
the code which don't match the documentation? When you find an instance of the
discongruity, please make an issue in /issues/ with a description of the
functionality described in the docs, and a description of the implemented
functionality. Include any other relevant information such as line-numbers and
suggested fixes.
