some transcripts may include privacy-violating data. The incident that
inspired the creation of this ticket was in the neocities-modernization
project, where many usernames are being included in the transcript.

to complete this ticket, there should be a complete audit done of all the
project transcripts, after retranscribing each of them. In this audit, all
personally identifiable information including names, addresses, and usernames
should be scrubbed. This excludes Ritz Menardi, because she's me, and I don't
mind if people know who I am, because this is my project after all! If they
know the project, then they know my name, which is okay. BUT other people did
not consent to have their names displayed for all to see, so we should try and
audit the transcript files as best we can to identify and remove such data.

Identification is the first part. A sub-issue should be implemented to
create a PII stripping system that can be customized on a per-project basis.
These customizations should live in the LLM-transcripts directory created by
the script, in a "custom-privacy-rules" directory. In this directory, we should
create lua functions that are called dynamically from the main script when the
transcription script is run. They should iterate through the transcript and
strip out any PII, replacing it with anonymized identifiers such as "user-1" and
"user-2" etc.
