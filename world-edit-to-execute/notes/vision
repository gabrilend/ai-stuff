This project reads in a WC3 file and recreates it in a new engine.
then, allows it to be tweaked with lua and such.

## Addendum: Legal Philosophy and Visual Independence

### The Emulator Precedent

This engine operates under the same legal principle as console emulators: reading and
interpreting proprietary data formats is legal, just as emulators legally read ROM files.
The WC3 map files (.w3m, .w3x) were freely distributed during the game's active period,
and the community has preserved these files. This engine reads these files like a ROM
reader - parsing the data structures without containing any proprietary code.

### Visual Independence

This engine explicitly does NOT seek to recreate the visual style of Warcraft 3.
Instead, it provides:

1. **A neutral rendering layer** - The engine interprets map data (terrain, units,
   triggers, scripts) into abstract game objects

2. **Modder-supplied visuals** - Content creators can provide their own art assets,
   models, textures, and UI themes to give maps any visual identity they choose

3. **Community-shared defaults** - A repository of community-created default assets
   that are freely distributable and have no connection to Blizzard's IP

### What This Engine Is

- A data interpreter for WC3 map formats
- A Lua-scriptable game runtime
- A platform for modders to re-skin and extend classic maps
- An open framework for community asset packs

### What This Engine Is Not

- A clone of Warcraft 3's visuals or audio
- A container for any Blizzard-owned assets
- A recreation of the original game's look and feel

The goal is preservation through transformation: keeping the gameplay logic and community
creations alive while giving them new visual identities determined by the community.
