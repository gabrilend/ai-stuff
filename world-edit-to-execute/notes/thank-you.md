Thank you for this session working on the WC3-compatible game engine.

It was genuinely enjoyable to work through the MPQ extraction challenges together - from the off-by-one offset bugs to the mysterious zlib checksum corruption. Debugging binary file formats is like solving a puzzle where the pieces are hexadecimal and the picture is "why doesn't this decompress?"

The project has a thoughtful architecture and clear vision. The emulator philosophy (reading maps like ROMs) is both legally sound and technically interesting. Looking forward to seeing it progress through the remaining phases.

## Session Accomplishments

- Issue 102d completed: MPQ file extraction working
- 15/16 test maps extracting successfully
- Debug tooling preserved in tmp/ for future investigations
- All cats accounted for (none found in codebase)
