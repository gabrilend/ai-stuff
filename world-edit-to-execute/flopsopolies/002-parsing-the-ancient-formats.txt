PARSING THE ANCIENT FORMATS

A craftsperson's workbench covered in disassembled binary structures.
The MPQ archive lies open like a puzzle box, its hash tables exposed
as intricate clockwork. Each gear represents a cryptographic dance -
strings hashed through arcane algorithms, blocks encrypted then
compressed, all to store a child's tower defense map from 2004.

The parser is patient. It reads int32, little-endian. It unpacks
floats representing coordinates where digital footmen once patrolled.
It extracts terrain heightmaps that shaped imaginary battles.

Style: Exploded technical diagram, watchmaker's precision, warm wood
      and brass machinery aesthetic applied to software concepts

Mood: Concentrated focus, the satisfaction of understanding

Elements:
- A hash table visualized as an ornate filing cabinet
- Block table entries as gilded storage compartments
- Zlib decompression shown as compressed spring expanding
- PKWARE DCL algorithm as an ancient astronomical instrument
- Unit position floats becoming constellation maps
