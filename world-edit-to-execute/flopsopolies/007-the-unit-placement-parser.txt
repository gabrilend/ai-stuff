THE UNIT PLACEMENT PARSER (Issue 202)

A single file - war3mapUnits.doo - contains multitudes. Every preplaced
unit, building, hero, and item. Their positions frozen in time. Their
inventories loaded. Their abilities configured. Their drop tables set.

The parser approaches it like a census taker visiting a vast city.
First the header: "W3do", version 8, 2,847 entries. Then each citizen,
one by one. The footman at (1024.0, 2048.0) facing northeast. The
archmage with 3 points in Blizzard. The gold mine with 12,500 gold.

Some entries are heroes - capital letter IDs betraying their nature.
These have levels, stat bonuses, six inventory slots. The parser notes
everything.

Some entries are random. "YYU5" - a placeholder meaning "spawn a random
level 5 unit here when the game begins." The parser preserves this
intention without interpreting it.

At the end, creation_number 2847, the census is complete.
