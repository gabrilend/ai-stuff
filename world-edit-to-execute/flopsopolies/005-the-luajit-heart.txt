THE LUAJIT HEART

At the center of the engine beats a JIT compiler. Lua bytecode flows
through its chambers, emerging as native machine code that runs at
near-C speed. The compat layer sits at the threshold, translating
between Lua 5.1's string.unpack and LuaJIT's ffi, between bit.band
and bit32, ensuring the heart can beat in any Lua environment.

The parsers are arteries - doo.lua, w3i.lua, wts.lua, w3e.lua - each
one carrying structured data from raw binary files to the living
game state. They use vimfolds as valves, collapsing complexity until
needed.

Around the heart, the data model crystallizes: Map, DoodadTable,
UnitTable, StringTable, Terrain. Each a chamber holding parsed wisdom.

Style: Anatomical diagram meets circuit schematic, organic machinery,
      bioluminescent code flow

Mood: Vital energy, efficient translation, living system

Elements:
- LuaJIT logo as a glowing core
- Parser modules as arteries with binary flowing in, tables flowing out
- Vimfolds as muscle fibers that contract and expand
- The compat.lua module as a universal adaptor joint
- Test suites as diagnostic sensors throughout
