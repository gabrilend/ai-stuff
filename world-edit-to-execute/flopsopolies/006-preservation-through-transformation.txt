PRESERVATION THROUGH TRANSFORMATION

A community's creative works - tower defense maps, hero arenas, RPGs,
custom campaigns - were trapped in a format tied to a single game.
The company moved on. The game changed. The old maps grew silent.

But the data remains. Encoded in war3map.w3i are the names mapmakers
chose. In war3mapUnits.doo are the positions they carefully placed.
In war3map.j are the scripts they wrote, function by function, in
a language called JASS that only this one game understood.

The engine doesn't resurrect the original. It transforms. The JASS
becomes Lua. The proprietary visuals become community placeholders.
The format-locked creativity becomes platform-independent data.

The maps live again, wearing new clothes, speaking new tongues,
but carrying the same souls their creators gave them.

Style: Metamorphosis imagery, chrysalis to butterfly, translation
      as transformation, data as spirit passing between vessels

Mood: Hopeful preservation, respectful continuation, creative rebirth

Elements:
- Old .w3x files as cocoons, new Lua tables as emerging forms
- JASS syntax morphing into Lua syntax mid-flight
- Community asset packs as colorful wings being attached
- A timeline showing 2002 -> 2024, with the spirit passing through
- Map names in TRIGSTR format resolving to actual titles
