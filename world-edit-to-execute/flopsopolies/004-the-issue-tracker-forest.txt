THE ISSUE-TRACKER FOREST

A forest of markdown files grows organically. Each tree is an issue,
its trunk inscribed with "Current Behavior" and "Intended Behavior".
Sub-issues branch outward - 202a, 202b, 202c - each leaf a checkbox
waiting to be filled.

The forest floor is littered with completed issues, their checkboxes
all marked, now composting into the /completed/ directory where they
nourish future growth. A small demo script runs at the edge of each
clearing, showing what this phase of growth has produced.

An issue-splitter daemon floats between trees, pruning and grafting,
analyzing which issues should divide and which should remain whole.

Style: Bonsai information architecture, organic git branching patterns,
      markdown syntax rendered as natural growth rings

Mood: Patient cultivation, systematic progress, living documentation

Elements:
- Trees with issue numbers carved into bark (201, 202, 203...)
- Dependency arrows as vines connecting related issues
- A "Phase 2: Data Model" canopy section
- Checkmarks appearing like flowers blooming
- The completed/ directory as a peaceful grove
