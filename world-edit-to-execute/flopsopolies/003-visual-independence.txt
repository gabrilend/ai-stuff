VISUAL INDEPENDENCE

Where there once were copyrighted textures, now geometric placeholders.
Where there were proprietary models, now wireframe abstractions that
invite the community to dress them. The engine renders without memory
of the original aesthetic - a blank canvas that knows only positions
and behaviors.

A footman is a capsule with a sword-shaped line.
A tree is a vertical cylinder with a green cone.
A hero is a slightly taller capsule with a glow.

The community arrives with their brushes. One paints anime. Another
sculpts voxels. A third prefers ASCII art rendered in the terminal.
All valid. All welcome. The gameplay logic underneath doesn't care
what costume the actors wear.

Style: Minimalist geometric primitives, wireframe rendering, clean
      vector graphics transitioning to diverse art styles at edges

Mood: Creative freedom, communal ownership, legal clarity

Elements:
- Simple capsule/cylinder primitives in formation
- Paint brushes and texture palettes floating nearby
- Multiple art style variations emerging from same base geometry
- A "NO BLIZZARD ASSETS" sign rendered in friendly pixels
