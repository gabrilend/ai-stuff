THE NINE PHASES

The roadmap stretches into the distance like a mountain range.

Phase 0: Tools - The forge where issue-splitter and TUI libraries
         were crafted. COMPLETED, its peaks behind us.

Phase 1: File Formats - The excavation. MPQ, W3I, WTS, W3E. Learning
         to read what others wrote. COMPLETED, treasures extracted.

Phase 2: Data Model - Where we stand now. Units, doodads, regions,
         cameras, sounds. Organizing the excavated treasures.

Phase 3: Logic Layer - The distant spire. Triggers, JASS, transpilation
         to Lua. Teaching the engine to think as the maps intended.

Phase 4: Runtime - The engine room. Game loops, ECS, pathfinding.
         Making things move.

Phase 5: Rendering - The artist's studio. Visual abstraction, asset
         pack loading, wireframe defaults.

Phase 6: Asset System - The community marketplace. Pack formats,
         hot reload, validation.

Phase 7: Gameplay - The arena. Combat, abilities, resources, fog.

Phase 8: Multiplayer - The network. Protocols, determinism, replays.

Phase 9: Polish - The final pass. Console, debug tools, UX.

Style: Mountain range with labeled peaks, journey map, RPG skill tree
      aesthetic, progress markers
