# Issue 203: Parse war3map.w3r (Regions)

**Phase:** 2 - Data Model
**Type:** Feature
**Priority:** Medium
**Dependencies:** 102-implement-mpq-archive-parser

---

## Current Behavior

Cannot read region definitions. Trigger regions, waygate destinations, and
ambient sound zones are inaccessible for scripting and gameplay.

---

## Intended Behavior

A parser that extracts all region definitions from war3map.w3r:
- Region names and IDs
- Bounding boxes (left, right, bottom, top)
- Weather effect assignments
- Ambient sound assignments
- Editor display colors

---

## Suggested Implementation Steps

1. **Create parser module**
   ```
   src/parsers/
   └── w3r.lua          (this issue)
   ```

2. **Implement header parsing**
   ```lua
   -- war3map.w3r header structure:
   -- Offset  Type      Description
   -- 0x00    int32     File version (5 for TFT)
   -- 0x04    int32     Number of regions
   ```

3. **Implement region entry parsing**
   ```lua
   -- Each region entry (variable size):
   -- float:   Left boundary
   -- float:   Bottom boundary
   -- float:   Right boundary
   -- float:   Top boundary
   -- string:  Region name (null-terminated)
   -- int32:   Creation number (unique editor ID)
   -- char[4]: Weather effect ID (0 = none)
   -- string:  Ambient sound name (null-terminated, references w3s)
   -- byte:    Red color component (editor display)
   -- byte:    Green color component
   -- byte:    Blue color component
   -- byte:    Alpha (usually 0xFF)
   ```

4. **Return structured data**
   ```lua
   return {
       version = 5,
       regions = {
           {
               name = "gg_rct_Start_Area",
               creation_number = 0,
               bounds = {
                   left = -512.0,
                   bottom = -512.0,
                   right = 512.0,
                   top = 512.0,
               },
               weather = nil,          -- or "RAhr" for Ashenvale Rain
               ambient_sound = nil,    -- or "gg_snd_RainLoop"
               color = { r = 0, g = 0, b = 255, a = 255 },
           },
           -- ...
       },
   }
   ```

5. **Add region lookup by creation number**
   ```lua
   -- Build index for waygate lookups
   local regions_by_id = {}
   for _, region in ipairs(regions) do
       regions_by_id[region.creation_number] = region
   end
   ```

## Technical Notes

### Weather Effect IDs

Common weather effect codes:
```lua
local WEATHER_EFFECTS = {
    ["RAhr"] = "ashenvale_rain_heavy",
    ["RAlr"] = "ashenvale_rain_light",
    ["MEds"] = "dungeon_mist_blue",
    ["FDbh"] = "dungeon_fog_heavy_brown",
    ["FDbl"] = "dungeon_fog_light_brown",
    ["SNbs"] = "northrend_blizzard",
    ["SNhs"] = "northrend_snow_heavy",
    ["SNls"] = "northrend_snow_light",
    -- ... more
}
```

### Region Naming Convention

Editor-generated regions follow pattern: `gg_rct_<name>`
- `gg_rct_` prefix is standard
- Name part comes from World Editor region name

### Usage in Triggers

Regions are referenced by:
- Trigger conditions (unit enters/leaves region)
- Waygate destinations (creation_number matches)
- Weather/sound zones
- Spawn points

### Coordinate System

Region bounds use world coordinates:
- Values in game units (1/128 of terrain tile)
- Origin at map center
- Bounds define axis-aligned rectangle

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Can parse war3map.w3r from all test archives
- [x] Correctly extracts region names
- [x] Correctly extracts bounding boxes
- [x] Correctly extracts weather effects
- [x] Correctly extracts ambient sound references
- [x] Correctly extracts editor colors
- [x] Provides lookup by creation number
- [x] Returns structured Lua table
- [x] Unit tests for parser

## Notes

Regions are a simpler format compared to doodads/units. They're primarily
used for trigger scripting (detecting unit positions) and ambient effects.

The creation_number field is important for waygate functionality - a
waygate's destination references the creation_number of its target region.

## Sub-Issue Analysis

## Sub-Issue Analysis

This issue is **already well-scoped and doesn't require splitting**.

### Reasoning

1. **Single file format** - The w3r format is straightforward with only two parsing stages (header + region entries)

2. **Linear structure** - Unlike complex formats with multiple interdependent sections, regions are a simple array of entries

3. **Modest complexity** - The format has:
   - 2-field header
   - ~10 fields per region entry
   - One lookup index to build

4. **Self-contained** - No internal cross-references between regions; each region is independent

5. **Clear scope** - The acceptance criteria are specific and achievable in a single implementation pass

### Comparison to Issues That Benefit From Splitting

| Aspect | This Issue (203) | Issues Worth Splitting |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| Parsing stages | 2 (header, entries) | 5+ distinct sections |
| Entry complexity | Simple flat structure | Nested/recursive data |
| Cross-references | None internal | Heavy internal linking |
| Estimated LOC | ~150-200 | 500+ |

### Recommendation

**Keep as single issue.** The implementation steps are already well-defined:

1. Header parsing (trivial)
2. Region entry parsing (bulk of work, but straightforward)
3. Lookup index (trivial addition)

If anything, this issue could serve as a **template** for other simple format parsers (w3s, w3c, etc.) since it demonstrates good structure without over-complexity.

### Only Consideration for Future

If during implementation you discover version differences (e.g., RoC vs TFT formats differ significantly), that could warrant a sub-issue. But based on the specification notes, version 5 (TFT) appears to be the only relevant variant.

## Implementation Notes

*Completed 2025-12-16*

### Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `src/parsers/w3r.lua` | Region parser module (~175 LOC) |
| `src/tests/test_w3r.lua` | Test suite with map iteration |

### Implementation Details

1. **Parser structure** follows existing w3i.lua pattern:
   - Uses `compat.lua` for LuaJIT/Lua 5.3+ compatibility
   - Vimfolds for code organization
   - Binary reading utilities (reusable pattern)

2. **API provided**:
   - `w3r.parse(data)` - Parse binary data, returns structured table
   - `w3r.get_region(result, creation_number)` - Lookup by ID
   - `w3r.format(result)` - Human-readable output
   - `w3r.WEATHER_EFFECTS` - Weather code lookup table

3. **Color byte order**: The w3r format stores colors as BGRA (not RGBA). Parser extracts as individual r/g/b/a fields for clarity.

4. **Test results**:
   - 16/16 test maps process successfully
   - All test maps happen to have no regions defined (common for AoS-style maps)
   - Synthetic data test verifies all parsing logic works correctly
   - Floats, strings, lookup index all validated

### Output Structure

```lua
{
    version = 5,
    regions = {
        {
            name = "gg_rct_Start_Area",
            creation_number = 0,
            bounds = { left = -512.0, bottom = -512.0, right = 512.0, top = 512.0 },
            weather = "ashenvale_rain_heavy",  -- or nil
            weather_id = "RAhr",               -- or nil
            ambient_sound = "gg_snd_RainLoop", -- or nil
            color = { r = 0, g = 0, b = 255, a = 255 },
        },
    },
    by_creation_number = { [0] = <region ref> },
}
