### User Request 1

hello, can you create some documents in /docs/ that describe the vision as
described in /notes/vision?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 1

I've created five comprehensive documentation files in `/docs/` based on the
vision described in `/notes/vision`:

1. **game-overview.md** - High-level introduction and core concepts
2. **gameplay-mechanics.md** - Detailed mechanics including combat, resources,
and unit behavior
3. **unit-system.md** - Unit templates, abilities, and mana system
4. **map-and-pathfinding.md** - Map structure and movement mechanics
5. **visual-design.md** - Design philosophy and accessibility considerations

Each document captures the key aspects of your RPG-battler vision while
organizing the information into logical, focused sections for easy reference
during development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 2

Great, thanks! Can you create a roadmap that details the implementation steps to
create the game?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 2

I've created a comprehensive implementation roadmap at
`/docs/implementation-roadmap.md`. The roadmap breaks down development into 10
phases:

**Phases 1-3**: Foundation (Love2D setup, map generation, basic movement)
**Phases 4-6**: Core systems (abilities, unit templates, resources)  
**Phases 7-8**: Game flow and polish
**Phases 9-10**: Multiplayer and advanced features

Each phase contains specific, actionable tasks with checkboxes for tracking
progress. The roadmap prioritizes building a playable vertical slice early, then
expanding features systematically while maintaining balance and performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 3

Great, can you create issue files in the /issues/ directory which describe each
step necessary to complete the goals presented in the roadmap? Each issue file
should never be deleted, but rather moved to the /issues/completed/ directory.
They should be named first with a ID number, then a short description of the
issue such as "023-center-align-menu-text". Create as many issues as you need to
break down the problem into tiny parts. Let's start with phases 1-3 and we can
move on to future phases later. Each issue should describe the current behavior,
describe the intended behavior, and then describe the implementation details
along with potential considerations and suggestions for tool use and any other
relevant details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 3

I've created comprehensive issue files covering Phases 1-3 of the roadmap (35
total issues), breaking down each major task into specific, actionable items.
Each issue includes:

- **Current/Intended Behavior**: Clear problem statement
- **Implementation Details**: Code examples and technical specifications  
- **Considerations**: Important edge cases and design decisions
- **Tool Suggestions**: Recommended development approaches
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific completion requirements

The issues are organized by phase:

**Phase 1 (Foundation)**: Issues #001-010
- Project setup, architecture, rendering, and core systems

**Phase 2 (Map & Movement)**: Issues #011-025  
- Map generation, lane systems, unit basics, and movement mechanics

**Phase 3 (Combat)**: Issues #026-035
- Combat systems, ranged mechanics, and base defense

Each issue is designed to be worked on independently while building toward the
complete game vision. The `/issues/completed/` directory structure is ready for
tracking progress as development proceeds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 4

Great! Thanks! Can you work on building a local installation of each of the
required libs in the /libs/ directory? We should need at least Love2d,
Luasocket, and dkjson.lua - If necessary, please write a compile script for each
of them which will compile them from source.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 4

Excellent! I've successfully set up a complete local library installation for
your RPG-autobattler project. Here's what has been accomplished:

## ✅ Completed Library Setup

## **Love2D** 
- Already installed system-wide (v11.5)
- Ready to use from command line

## **LuaSocket** 
- Downloaded source (v3.1.0)
- Compiled locally for Lua 5.2 compatibility
- All modules working (TCP, UDP, HTTP, SMTP, etc.)

## **dkjson** 
- Downloaded pure Lua library
- Ready for JSON encoding/decoding

## 📁 Directory Structure
```
libs/
├── README.md              # Complete documentation
├── luasocket/             # Compiled LuaSocket modules
├── dkjson/               # JSON library
├── scripts/              # All build/install scripts
└── example/              # Working Love2D demo
```

## 🛠️ Available Scripts
- `build-all.sh` - One-command setup for everything
- `build-luasocket.sh` - Compile LuaSocket with auto Lua version detection
- `download-luasocket.sh` - Download LuaSocket source
- `download-dkjson.sh` - Download dkjson library
- `install-love2d.sh` - Install Love2D if needed
- `test-libs.sh` - Comprehensive library testing

## ✅ All Tests Passing
- Love2D: Working
- LuaSocket: All socket types functional  
- dkjson: Encoding/decoding confirmed
- Example app: Runs successfully

The libraries are now ready for use in your RPG-autobattler development! The
example in `/libs/example/` shows exactly how to integrate them into your Love2D
project.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 5

Great! Can you ensure that Lua is also bundled locally? I don't want to use any
libraries that are installed system-wide. Everything required to run the program
should be included in the project directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 5

Excellent! I've successfully created a completely self-contained local library
installation for your RPG-autobattler project. Here's what has been
accomplished:

## ✅ Complete Local Setup Achieved

## **Bundled Libraries**
- **Lua 5.2.4**: Compiled locally from source
- **Love2D 11.5**: Downloaded as portable AppImage  
- **LuaSocket 3.1.0**: Compiled against local Lua
- **dkjson**: Pure Lua JSON library

## **Zero System Dependencies**
Everything needed to run your project is now contained in the `/libs/`
directory:
- No system-wide Lua installation required
- No system Love2D installation required  
- No system Lua development headers required
- Completely portable between machines

## **Easy Execution Methods**

**Method 1: Wrapper Scripts (Recommended)**
```bash
bash libs/scripts/run-local-lua.sh myscript.lua
bash libs/scripts/run-local-love.sh mygame/
```

**Method 2: Direct Binary Usage**
```bash
libs/lua/local/bin/lua myscript.lua
libs/love2d/love-11.5-x86_64.AppImage mygame/
```

## **Complete Build System**
All scripts are available for:
- `build-all.sh` - One-command setup
- `build-lua.sh` - Local Lua compilation
- `download-love2d.sh` - Love2D AppImage download
- `build-luasocket.sh` - LuaSocket compilation with local Lua
- `test-libs.sh` - Comprehensive testing

## **Verified Working**
All tests pass:
- ✅ Local Lua functional
- ✅ Local Love2D functional  
- ✅ LuaSocket compiles and works with local Lua
- ✅ dkjson loads and functions correctly
- ✅ All libraries integrate properly

Your project is now completely self-contained and can be moved to any Linux
system without requiring any additional installations!
