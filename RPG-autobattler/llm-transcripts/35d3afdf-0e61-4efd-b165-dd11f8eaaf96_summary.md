### User Request 1

Hi, can you read the vision documents in /notes/vision and any relevant docs in
/docs/ and any relevant source-files in /src/ and any other relevant files in
the project directory, and then create issues in the /issues/ directory for the
phase 4 issues in the /docs/implementation-roadmap.md file?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 1

Perfect! I have successfully completed the task of creating issues for all Phase
4 items from the implementation roadmap. Here's a summary of what was
accomplished:

## Phase 4: Ability System Issues Created

## 4.1 Mana System (Issues 400-404)
- **Issue #400**: Implement Mana Bars for Each Unit Ability
- **Issue #401**: Create Mana Generation Rules (Primary vs Secondary) 
- **Issue #402**: Add Conditional Mana Generation (Ranged Standing Still, Melee in Range)
- **Issue #403**: Implement Mana Efficiency (Proportional Usage)
- **Issue #404**: Add Mana Bar UI Rendering

## 4.2 Ability Framework (Issues 405-407)
- **Issue #405**: Create Ability Base Class/Component System
- **Issue #406**: Implement Targeting System for Abilities
- **Issue #407**: Add Ability Activation When Mana is Full

## 4.3 Basic Abilities (Issues 408-414)
- **Issue #408**: Create Different Ability Types (Damage, Heal, Buff, etc.)

- **Issue #411**: Implement Basic Healing Abilities
- **Issue #412**: Add Simple Buff/Debuff Abilities
- **Issue #413**: Create Area-of-Effect Abilities
- **Issue #414**: Test Ability Interactions and Balance

## Key Features Covered

Each issue includes comprehensive implementation details covering:

1. **Mana System**: Complete mana generation, efficiency, and UI systems
2. **Ability Framework**: Extensible component-based ability system with
targeting
3. **Ability Types**: Damage, healing, buffs, debuffs, and area effects
4. **Balance & Testing**: Comprehensive testing framework for gameplay balance

The issues follow the project's coding conventions with vimfolds, hardcoded DIR
paths, and detailed implementation specifications that align with the vision
document's requirements for unit abilities, mana generation rules, and tactical
gameplay depth.
