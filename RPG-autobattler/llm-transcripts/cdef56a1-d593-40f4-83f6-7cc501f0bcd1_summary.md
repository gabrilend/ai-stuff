### User Request 1

Hi, can you create issue files in the /issues/ directory? I recommend checking
out the /notes/vision file, and any other relevant files you can find. We need
to work on phase 5. When naming the files for phase 5, please put 5 as the first
digit like so: 512 for ID number 12 in the 5th phase.

### Assistant Response 1

I've successfully created all the Phase 5 issue files for the Unit Templates
system. Here's what I've completed:
