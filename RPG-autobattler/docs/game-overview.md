# RPG-Battler: Game Overview

## Introduction

RPG-battler is a strategy game built in Lua using the love2d framework. It combines real-time tactical combat with strategic unit deployment on a unique map-based battlefield.

## Core Concept

Players command armies of customizable units across a network of pathways inspired by the dense mesh network of pipes from classic screensavers. The objective is to push through enemy defenses and destroy their base while protecting your own.

## Victory Conditions

The game is won by destroying the enemy base, which requires:
- Breaking through three defense shields (each with ~5 average units worth of health)
- Destroying the main base (also ~5 average units worth of health)
- Total effective base health: ~20 average units

## Key Features

- **Custom Unit Templates**: Players design their own units using a balanced point system
- **Automatic Combat**: Units fight autonomously using their programmed abilities
- **Strategic Deployment**: Choose lanes and formations for maximum tactical advantage
- **Resource Management**: Gold accumulates over time for purchasing units
- **Colorblind-Friendly Design**: Shape-based symbols with color as aesthetic enhancement

## Target Experience

The game aims to provide fair and satisfying strategic gameplay where victory is achieved through careful unit design and skillful deployment rather than overwhelming force or luck.
