it's like majesty except textual. And it uses GPT to generate short descriptions
of what's going on. And you can click on a phrase or token and it'll "zoom in"
and update the text descriptions with more detail. You can keep zooming in and
in until you're literally looking at microbes.

Zooming out is the same thing - the description on the page will slowly become
more and more general until eventually you have a description of the solar
system (or beyond!)

And it'll just keep updating as stuff happens in the underlying simulation. So
the descriptions will dynamically update as things happen. Downside is you need
to spend a lot on GPT but it'd be TOTALLY WORTH IT OMG

THINK ABOUT IT you have a fantasy world simulator! JUST PROGRAM IT and have GPT
describe it dynamically! DO IT NOOOOW -> capitals courtesy of "inner child"

AND THEN you just need a "prompt to video" AI (those exist btw, and will only
get better over time) and tell it to create a video of what's happening - BOOM
instant video game. THEN give the player the ability to edit the prompt, and BAM
godlike powers. Wow what a concept. Brilliant idea Cameron, you truly are this
world's premier game designer. NOW GO MAKE IT okay okay I'll try.

First things first. We need an "underlying simulation" - Joust is a good example
of GPT3 integration. But we need a simulation to go below it. And for that you
need a lot of data. Github COPILOT to the rescue.

So this simulation needs to keep track of positions, and classes of things that
can act upon the world. Everything has a position, and it can only affect things
near it. That's just baked into the rules of the world. Near can be a conceptual
near though, like being close to a person or something.

These things will have descriptions. Descriptions can be created by AI later on,
but for now they are randomly generated. Or for MVP they can be static.

These things will have names. These names don't have to be unique, because they
also have an ID number.

They also need functions. These functions can be added and removed from the
thing, or maybe just enabled or disabled. I'm not sure which would be better.
Maybe both? So the entity can control it's own functions but also they can be
added or removed more permanently.

If you think about it, growing up is kinda like adding functions to your class.
like, every time you do something, it adds another entry for that particular
method. Like a "trial of the fittest" instead of "survival of the fittest".
When other animals *literally fight for life and death survival*, humans have
the luxury of... not doing that. That's the entire purpose of civilization - to
elevate people beyond the claws of nature. And yet we still let people go
homeless? We still imprison them when they've harmed us, rather than help them
reintegrate to society? Anyway you just asked me to hit you so here goes:
