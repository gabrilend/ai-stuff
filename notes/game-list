wow-chat:
-- turns world of warcraft into a roguelike. can be adapted to anbernic consoles
   because the behavior is written in lua that is executed by the eluna
   interpreter installed in an azerothcore installation and is built to be part
   of the client. so, each one hosts and connects to others and syncs the data
   between them. unrecognized data format? don't accept it! have a very strict
   and regulated protocol. sorta like...grammar laws.

pong, except it's like brick breakers, and you can't see the opponent's screen
except for like, 3 rows or whatever. to be played between anbernics, or on two
separate TVs. make it a roguelike. make it a map painter.

a game that's a swarm of particle simulation lights that live and breathe like
artificial life, given basic rules and taught to orbit objects, falling sand
game style simulation, but with planetary style physics.

a generic control device that sends it's button status as json to any target
that is listening in the area. TCP style. for piloting action figure drones.

a game that automatically sets all the settings necessary to make sure that the
game only accepts virtual-machine bytecode input. can read more at:

this would essentially disable any non anbernic-to-anbernic communication.
literally just. put something in the wifi driver or even physically between the
wifi card and the rest of the computer that encrypted or decrypted everything.
boom, slower, but secure.

a game with default characters exploring default mechanics and simulating
            default whims

I can do better... for symbeline...
