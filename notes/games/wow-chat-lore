the horde and alliance are no more

the scourge and the burning legion came and took what they came for

our heroes languished in despair as their lights were snuffed out

one

by

one

but a new day is dawning, a day of legends

stride forth and meet the legions

and your tale will never be unsaid

ride out as a new day is dawning

and save us from hell's fading warning

go, now, as our hopes abound,

and claim a future for the yearning.
