please always always ALWAYS use git --commit after every SINGLE command. it is
IMPERATIVE, as the whole point of the software is to be repeatable and
re-windable. so every moment not only of it's creation, but also it's execution,
must be recorded on every computer where it is run. this isn't difficult - just
keep track of what *changed*. plus the commands given to make them happen.
treat the programming of the source code as the source code.

not like a worm, but rather like a particle simulation.
artificial life, just... made more complicated.
remember those particle sim games on the early early early days of the app store
for ios?
like, iPhone 1
remember? the first smartphone. it had an app store... eventually.

there were some particle simulations on there. I loved them. just... they were
awesome and great.

hey, instead of whatever the code in this repository's about, can we just make
it like a particle sim? built for the gameboy, with fully black screens. Bright,
bold colors, like distant cyan flame or hazy bright green yellow. All sorts on
the color spectrum, but too many to count so I won't. You'll find them as you
go along. They radiated light and warmth in a cold, vast dark. I loved them! You
could add gravity wells, and differing conditions
you could make some of them react to others in other ways

like, a 3d falling sand game, but projected onto 2d. notice I said PROJECTED,
not sliced. Sliced would be like... "doh I can't see the 4th dimension because I
don't know how it's projected" whatever. make a decision, pick a direction, and
go with it. You want falling sand games on the GBA? why? *(to play on anbernics*

swarm particle simulator development simulator, here with the full git commit
history of every single change or bash command, written to a file and committed
as "bash-history-txt.txt"

(omg don't kill your precious human input, it's sacred to the project)

you have no idea what consequences or effects your actions might have.
therefore you are not qualified to make them. why not make office software
on a super nez? *it runs on linux now*, it's called an emulator.

... actually we should probably leave the respiratory alone. there's some good
work being done here on GBA functionality, wouldn't wanna lose it.
