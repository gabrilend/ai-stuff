# Issue 005: Unit Testing Framework

## Current Behavior
No testing infrastructure exists for the project.

## Intended Behavior
A comprehensive unit testing framework with high coverage for the RISC-V simulator, editor components, and visualization features.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Configure testing framework (Jest/Vitest)
2. Set up test environment for browser APIs
3. Create test utilities for simulator testing
4. Write unit tests for RISC-V instruction execution
5. Create component tests for UI elements
6. Implement integration tests for editor-simulator interaction
7. Set up code coverage reporting
8. Configure continuous integration testing

## Priority
Medium

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Dependencies
- Issue 001 (Project Setup)
- Issue 002 (RISC-V Simulator Core)
