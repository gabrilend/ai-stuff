# Issue 002: Basic RISC-V Simulator Core

## Current Behavior
No RISC-V simulation engine exists.

## Intended Behavior
A functional RISC-V RV32I instruction set simulator that can execute basic assembly programs with register and memory management.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design CPU state representation (registers, memory, PC)
2. Implement instruction decoding for RV32I base instruction set
3. Create instruction execution engine
4. Implement memory management system
5. Add register file management
6. Create program loading and initialization
7. Implement basic debugging capabilities
8. Add instruction cycle counting

## Priority
High

## Estimated Effort
5-7 days

## Dependencies
- Issue 001 (Project Setup)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CPU state properly represented
- [ ] All RV32I instructions implemented
- [ ] Memory read/write operations working
- [ ] Register file operations working
- [ ] Program loading from assembly text
- [ ] Step-by-step execution capability
- [ ] Basic error handling for invalid instructions
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for all instructions
