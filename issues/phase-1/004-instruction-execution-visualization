# Issue 004: Instruction Execution Visualization

## Current Behavior
No visualization exists for RISC-V instruction execution.

## Intended Behavior
An interactive visualization component that shows step-by-step instruction execution, register changes, memory updates, and program counter movement.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design visualization layout and components
2. Create register file display component
3. Implement memory view component
4. Add program counter and instruction display
5. Create step-by-step execution controls
6. Implement highlighting for changed values
7. Add animation transitions for state changes
8. Create reset and run-to-completion functionality

## Priority
High

## Estimated Effort
4-5 days

## Dependencies
- Issue 002 (RISC-V Simulator Core)
- Issue 003 (Web-Based Code Editor)
