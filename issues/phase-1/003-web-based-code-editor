# Issue 003: Web-Based Code Editor

## Current Behavior
No web interface for editing RISC-V assembly code exists.

## Intended Behavior
A functional web-based code editor with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and basic editing features for RISC-V assembly code.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Research and select code editor library (Monaco, CodeMirror, etc.)
2. Create React/Vue component wrapper for editor
3. Implement RISC-V assembly syntax highlighting
4. Add line numbering and basic editor features
5. Implement code validation and error highlighting
6. Add auto-completion for RISC-V instructions
7. Create editor toolbar with common actions
8. Implement code import/export functionality

## Priority
High

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days
