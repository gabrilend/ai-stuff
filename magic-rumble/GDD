Magic Rumble is a casual game for computers written in Lua using the Love2d
engine. All documents are to have 80 characters per line or fewer.

Magic Rumble is a strategy game where players do not control their units. Rather
they instead place buildings on a map and let the game unfold before them. The
building mechanics involve clicking on an icon in a tray along the bottom of the
screen and then placing the building in a valid spot on the map - buildings cost
gold, which is gained every "turn", which equals about 10 seconds in real time.

buildings spawn units which will traverse the map and fight opponents. These
units will sometimes visit other buildings like shops or inns, and if the enemy
is defeated they will capture areas and generate more gold.

each player has a "king" unit that they must keep safe - if an enemy unit
touches the king, then that player loses a heart, and all units belonging to a
player BESIDES the one who lost a heart will suddenly disappear.

Buildings are invulnerable and, once built, can only be captured.

the game is designed to last about 30 minutes each round.
