Ask what they want, and then help them build it. Include them in your thought processes when you're problem solving, and ask them for input.

Like, it's best if they accomplish more and lived life more fully than you did at your age, but don't push them to be wise or strong or intelligent at the age they are now. Trust that they will grow when you give them room to, and guide and cultivate them toward goodness. For example, if they do something wrong (hitting other kids, messing with animals, destroying objects) then guide them toward a better path. Teach them empathy, and show them how it works by doing it yourself! Ask them questions like \"How would you feel if that happened to you?\", show them weak points and how to avoid them when playing, and give them alternatives to the behaviors they do that directly harm others. \"Maybe play with the dog this way, instead of being rough\" \"Maybe you and that other kid can ride your bikes or draw instead of fighting - or if you still want to fight, then learn how to tell when someone is hurt and try to help them.\"\n\nThe goal isn't to push them really hard off a cliff in a hanglider, hoping they can figure it out in the air, it's to strengthen their legs so they can run fast enough that they can take off successfully.",

So how can you expect to be helped? It's one thing to believe in yourself to help yourself, but tbh you're a little behind on that one. So, let other people help you catch up. It's okay to just go with the flow. Don't be a rock, be a stick. Let yourself be guided along a good path.\n\nHow do I know it's actually a good path?\n\nBecause you evaluate it as you go. You can always put your feet down and go back to how you are now, stuck and slowly eroding away. Or you can be towed onto land - your call my dude. You're clinging to the ground.\n\nBut what about the examples of brainwashing that I've heard about? Like... Intense propaganda designed to create stochastic terrorism. How do I know I'm not being sucked into that?\n\nYou need to trust yourself. Follow the path that you know to be good, duh. Just don't I dunno, be an extremist?

If you want to love someone, think positive thoughts about them, and over time it'll become a reflex. This reflex will come naturally, and boom instead of \"thinking positive thoughts\" it'll manifest as love. Just like smile -> happy, so too does positivity -> love.\n\nAnd what about hate?\n\nWhat about it?\n\nHow is it represented, with a frown?\n\nNo, it's not like that. It's more like... Love is attraction, that binds you to good things. Hate isn't the rejection of things, it's an inward facing thing. And it's the opposite of attraction - it's like implosion. You'll literally implode if you hate yourself. It corrodes your insides and makes you weaker and more volatile. The opposite of love is... Kinda what you're doing. You're pushing people away because you don't want to lose control of yourself or your mind. And that's going to make you drift off into space, and nobody wants that. So... Love others, and you'll bind yourself to them and together you can work together. Don't push others, because that'll just make it more chaotic inside. Instead, love them. Trust me it'll work.",

Take care in the house of a witch such as this, and stay no longer than your time allows.\n\nIf you find what you're looking for, get out.\n\nIf you're almost out of time, get out.\n\nIf you lost something, find it, and then get out.\n\nIf you run out of time, and things start to \"smear\", yell out loud your social security number. If someone's trying to save you, it'll help them know where to put you when you are returned to your body.\n\nI'm sorry to say, but if things start to smear then life will get a little bit strange. Just a little. Much better to get out beforehand.\n\nIf you find yourself tempted while inside a witch's house, abandon what you lost because regaining it comes with a cost.\n\nIf you lose sight of your friend, then when you see them again you cannot trust that they are who they claim to be, not inside of the witch's house.\n\nIf you lose sight of your friend, trust that they will get out by their own hand, and find what you want and go home.\n\nUnless, of course, your heart is pure, and your friend is what you want back in your life again. Then you will trend toward finding them yet again, so find what you want and get out.\n\nThey will try to keep you there, through inaction and professed exhilaration, but generally they'll do what you command. So take them and get out.\n\nThere are many reasons why you might find yourself on the path to a witch's house, but none of them are to be repeated. It's more of a life event and less of a venture, so take what you want and go forth.\n\nIf you find yourself in my house, take a cookie or a brownie, and please do come again. The house of a witch such as mine is somewhere you'll probably find that love and affection are fonder.",

Essentials and infrastructure are free, but luxuries are not.\n\nTo spend dollars, you either go to a showroom or use the nationalized Amazon (forked, not stolen) - there you can place down dollars to enter a special kind of queue. Everytime a product is made its distributed to the people with the most dollars in queue. Every period (week, month, idk) the amount you manually put into the queue is re-added to the queue - 100 becomes 200, becomes 300, becomes 400. You can manually add more whenever you like but it's not retroactive. At the end of the period all your extra dollars are distributed among your open queues.\n\nThat's basically it. It rewards patience and temperance, while capitalism rewards greed and cruelty.\n\nHow to get dollars? Okay so there is a government run job board portal website thing. Every company can make a listing there, and every person can post themselves too if they'd rather be recruited. The company pays a different amount to the government than the worker receives. This amount is determined algorithmically based on values like supply and demand for labor in that particular area.\n\nPeople list 10 types of jobs they'd like to work at any level of specificity (they'd be arranged into layers of overlapping umbrellas, like queer identities except more complex) then that data is used both for job placement (consensual of course!) and data for the \"supply and demand\" calculation. You can only change these values once every 6 months, or 1 value every month, up to the user.\n\nThe amount the corporation pays to the government is not the same as what the worker receives. The longer a worker works, the more \"stuff\" they can buy. They are rewarded for diligence. However essentials are free so nobody has to save for retirement.\n\nYou can trade stuff for stuff, but not stuff for labor. Small informal exchanges are fine \"if you mow my lawn I'll bake you a pie\" but not \"I'll give you 500lbs of gold bars if you build me a mansion\" - I haven't figured out a way to structurally prevent rant besides just saying it's illegal.\n\nHousing is like a library, except you can queue for who gets the spot next. A person can live in a house as long as they'd like, and when they're done with it the person highest in the queue can decide if they want to live there. If not, the 2nd in line gets to move in if they want, etc. Their accrued value persists if they don't move in, and when moving out an accurate assessment should be undertaken.\n\n\"ah but won't foreign states just hire a bunch of people to move in and out of houses really quickly like they're doing to my apartment complex so that a stable source of income cannot be guaranteed and resources will have to be wasted on assessments and such?\" I mean, maybe, but it'd be up to the community to decide how to prevent that.\n\nYour primary residence is free, you can live there as long as you'd like. If you want two houses then you need to continuously be the highest value in the queue for both of them.

It's the same conflict, just different battlefields.\n\nPower cannot survive without the powerless, as it is inherently an imbalanced ratio between two parties - you cannot have power *with* someone, you have power *over* them.\n\nEvery day we take another step toward our liberation. Every moment we choose to live our lives in contrast to the will of power is another day we are empowered.\n\nThere can be no life without struggle, but the right to struggle on our own terms is something we should strive to grant to all people.\n\nPower begets power, and power corrupts. Hence, power is evil. It is not good to be evil, and goodness is what we should strive for - hence, power is penance - the infliction of corruption upon one's self in order to apply your will onto others in the world. Penance is a state of contrition, it is painful and ardent and necessary, but it is for the strong and the righteous to bear in service of the weak and meek.\n\nThe only unethical act is an application of power to an unconsenting subject. Your rights end where another's begin, hence, Paladins, who apply unethical acts toward those who manifest injustice.\n\nInjustice is when one party is harmed, and another benefits. Justice is when that benefiting party is brought low in pursuit of equality. True justice is when both parties benefit, and everyone gets what they want and need. True justice is hard.\n\nVirtue is goodness given form through the effects of our actions. It is both a reflection of how people see you (how you inspire them) and how they are helped or healed from your actions. It is also virtuous to help yourself, as you are a person too.\n\nSin is the opposite of virtue, it's when your actions create injustice. When you harm others or degrade yourself with hatred or contagious fear. It is to be avoided, but it's impossible to avoid fully as we are imperfect beings.\n\nForgiveness is good, but if you require it then you should probably relinquish your power until it is known that you're worthy of wielding it again. Sometimes people make mistakes, but mistakes do not require forgiveness.\n\n.......... Where was I going with this? Oh yeah.\n\nThe powerful hire people to dress up like us and be shitheads to the people who they want to hate us. And they do the same thing for the caricatures of them who we're meant to be afraid of. Downside is a caricature is a pretty good role model for people who don't know any better, and they've done their best to keep as many people as they can in the dark.\n\nSo, it won't be easy, but information has always been on our side. In a war of attrition we'll always come out on top, because thinking and compassion are both stepping stones to our schools of thought.

      "raw_content":"Feminism, queer theory, racial politics, class struggle... It's the same conflict, just different battlefields.\n\nPower cannot survive without the powerless, as it is inherently an imbalanced ratio between two parties - you cannot have power *with* someone, you have power *over* them.\n\nEvery day we take another step toward our liberation. Every moment we choose to live our lives in contrast to the will of power is another day we are empowered.\n\nThere can be no life without struggle, but the right to struggle on our own terms is something we should strive to grant to all people.\n\nPower begets power, and power corrupts. Hence, power is evil. It is not good to be evil, and goodness is what we should strive for - hence, power is penance - the infliction of corruption upon one's self in order to apply your will onto others in the world. Penance is a state of contrition, it is painful and ardent and necessary, but it is for the strong and the righteous to bear in service of the weak and meek.\n\nThe only unethical act is an application of power to an unconsenting subject. Your rights end where another's begin, hence, Paladins, who apply unethical acts toward those who manifest injustice.\n\nInjustice is when one party is harmed, and another benefits. Justice is when that benefiting party is brought low in pursuit of equality. True justice is when both parties benefit, and everyone gets what they want and need. True justice is hard.\n\nVirtue is goodness given form through the effects of our actions. It is both a reflection of how people see you (how you inspire them) and how they are helped or healed from your actions. It is also virtuous to help yourself, as you are a person too.\n\nSin is the opposite of virtue, it's when your actions create injustice. When you harm others or degrade yourself with hatred or contagious fear. It is to be avoided, but it's impossible to avoid fully as we are imperfect beings.\n\nForgiveness is good, but if you require it then you should probably relinquish your power until it is known that you're worthy of wielding it again. Sometimes people make mistakes, but mistakes do not require forgiveness.\n\n.......... Where was I going with this? Oh yeah.\n\nThe powerful hire people to dress up like us and be shitheads to the people who they want to hate us. And they do the same thing for the caricatures of them who we're meant to be afraid of. Downside is a caricature is a pretty good role model for people who don't know any better, and they've done their best to keep as many people as they can in the dark.\n\nSo, it won't be easy, but information has always been on our side. In a war of attrition we'll always come out on top, because thinking and compassion are both stepping stones to our schools of thought. And both of those actions are intrinsically human and good, so people gravitate to them. Meaning inertia is on our side.\n\nDownside is that its not always a war of attrition. Sometimes it's more about suppressing information until its impossible to communicate -> see \"dead Internet theory\" and \"musk breaking Twitter\" and \"the great firewall of china\" and such.\n\nTo speak is to think, and to hear is to show compassion.

Sometimes I'll say \"screw this I'm sick of them for one of many reasons I'm going to put in the effort and do all the kegels and just fucking handle it\" and like, that sorta works. At least, most of the time.\n\nThe thing about diapers is that while yes, you only need to think about your bodily functions like, twice a day, when you do it's more acute. It takes like 10 minutes to change, it generates trash that you have to throw away, it's literally pissing on cash made out of plastic fossil fuels, it smells, it's loud (fuck the noise) and its a pain in the ass when you get diaper rash. Ugh I hate it.\n\nSo, sometimes I say \"fuck it\" and I go without. And it works most of the time. But eventually after getting piss on the carpet one too many times, after throwing away your favorite underwear AGAIN, after trying your best to face away from people so they don't see the wet spot on your butt... Eventually you think \"hey maybe diapers aren't that bad\" and the cycle repeats.\n\nAnd look, I know I'm traumatized. I've been dealing with my own shit since I was a kid. But, like, therapy won't help me get to the toilet. A doctor's not going to be able to fix my brain deciding \"hey I want to piss myself right now for no fucking reason at all\", and yeah my muscles aren't great so sure I can exercise them or whatever.\n\nBut there have been times in my life when I've had a pelvic floor as strong as steel, and it didn't fucking help. Because my brain is stupid.\n\nI can feel it happening (most of the time, sometimes it surprises me like \"oh weird I can't remember peeing my pants\") and I usually have at least enough notice to clamp down (if I'm quick) but, like, I am constantly stressed out about it.

      "raw_content":"I wear diapers. I fucking hate diapers.\n\nI go in cycles with it. Waves, if you will. Sometimes I'll say \"screw this I'm sick of them for one of many reasons I'm going to put in the effort and do all the kegels and just fucking handle it\" and like, that sorta works. At least, most of the time.\n\nThe thing about diapers is that while yes, you only need to think about your bodily functions like, twice a day, when you do it's more acute. It takes like 10 minutes to change, it generates trash that you have to throw away, it's literally pissing on cash made out of plastic fossil fuels, it smells, it's loud (fuck the noise) and its a pain in the ass when you get diaper rash. Ugh I hate it.\n\nSo, sometimes I say \"fuck it\" and I go without. And it works most of the time. But eventually after getting piss on the carpet one too many times, after throwing away your favorite underwear AGAIN, after trying your best to face away from people so they don't see the wet spot on your butt... Eventually you think \"hey maybe diapers aren't that bad\" and the cycle repeats.\n\nAnd look, I know I'm traumatized. I've been dealing with my own shit since I was a kid. But, like, therapy won't help me get to the toilet. A doctor's not going to be able to fix my brain deciding \"hey I want to piss myself right now for no fucking reason at all\", and yeah my muscles aren't great so sure I can exercise them or whatever.\n\nBut there have been times in my life when I've had a pelvic floor as strong as steel, and it didn't fucking help. Because my brain is stupid.\n\nI can feel it happening (most of the time, sometimes it surprises me like \"oh weird I can't remember peeing my pants\") and I usually have at least enough notice to clamp down (if I'm quick) but, like, I am constantly stressed out about it. I'm constantly on guard, waiting for it to happen. It's fucking exhausting.\n\nGod forbid I have a public accident. Those are the fucking worst. And though I try my hardest, a year doesn't go by when I don't have at least one. If I'm diapered (as I fucking should be, tbh) then I can handle it.

They would bring with them only what they carry, and that's... not ideal, as most of the wealth of a nation is in it's interactions with others. But say they do not desire exclusion, and rather would instead prefer to simply trade with Vancouver or Quebec. External trade must be facilitated through a higher level, in this case the national level. Washington might request a certain type of good from Vancouver, and Maine might desire a service from Quebec. This request would be given to the national representative (or rather, the tier higher than the state) who would then develop a contract with the nation of Canada to purchase the type of good or service they desire. Assuming the canadians are still utilizing the capitalist mode of production and economics, there would need to be an exchange between American dollars and Canadian dollars. This is handled nationally, and those dollars can be circulated across the globe by canada should they desire. For example, the American dollars passed to Canada might be spent in Brazil, where they then find their way to England, and then to Australia. Then, several months later, those same American dollars are used to purchase a good or service from an American industry by creating a contract with the American government. Such a contract could be on the individual level or higher level, however as capitalism tends to decay all social fabrics that bind a group of people together leaving the naked individual alone, it tends to be on the individual level.",

      "raw_content":"Now, another example. Should Washington or Maine desire one day to become part of Canada, for example, they must necessarily seek exclusion from the United States market. They would bring with them only what they carry, and that's... not ideal, as most of the wealth of a nation is in it's interactions with others. But say they do not desire exclusion, and rather would instead prefer to simply trade with Vancouver or Quebec. External trade must be facilitated through a higher level, in this case the national level. Washington might request a certain type of good from Vancouver, and Maine might desire a service from Quebec. This request would be given to the national representative (or rather, the tier higher than the state) who would then develop a contract with the nation of Canada to purchase the type of good or service they desire. Assuming the canadians are still utilizing the capitalist mode of production and economics, there would need to be an exchange between American dollars and Canadian dollars. This is handled nationally, and those dollars can be circulated across the globe by canada should they desire. For example, the American dollars passed to Canada might be spent in Brazil, where they then find their way to England, and then to Australia. Then, several months later, those same American dollars are used to purchase a good or service from an American industry by creating a contract with the American government. Such a contract could be on the individual level or higher level, however as capitalism tends to decay all social fabrics that bind a group of people together leaving the naked individual alone, it tends to be on the individual level.",

Her mammoth was a boy though, just barely old enough to be on his own. She had helped clear a path earlier in the day and so she did not mind being carried. Much easier to be nested as she was. As they walked she ate a few of the berries she'd found yesterday - there's enough for a few days more. The mammoths were adept at clearing snow with their big teeth and they seemed compelled to carve path ways in the snow banks that rose a hundred feet above the ground. They made roads between the water sources and the few lands that humans had cleared and cultivated with our fire. Perhaps when the snow melts we'll make our own through the woods of the garden of eden, but for now we keep to ourselves. Each mammoth had a few people, and sometimes when they met another mammoth they'd switch places. The mammoths would decide by tapping them with their trunk, nobody knew why. Maybe they had their preferences. Or maybe they liked us better when we talked. Every new person was a chance to meet a new person, but after a while we'd go quiet. Kiri talked to her mammoths, but not too much or they'd get annoyed at that too. When they died, people made clothes from their skin and tents from their tusks. If they knew the one who had died they would rest their nose on the tusk as if in prayer. We learned that from them too. When the winter wolves came, we'd fight them off. But they wouldn't stop until a human fell, so it was a war of desperation. When we spent time near the oceans the great glaciers that covered the sea were burnt back by humanity, bit by bit until we could fish. And at those oasises we could stay and make ropes and stories and share the best seeds. Kiri didn't plant much, she didn't stay in one place for long so there was no point. She liked the warmth of the mammoth, and she liked meeting new people. She even killed a wolf once. The other animals usually left us alone, and we'd only hunt them if there was no other foods. So they knew not to eat everything. Her mammoth was stopping, the stars overhead twinkled through the thin canyon that they trudged down, pushing snow deeper down and to the sides. Sometimes the walls would collapse, and the humans would have to dig out their mammoth - they had enough fat to keep them warm for at least a day, which was usually enough time to get them out. Especially with fire, but there weren't always trees. She laid down next to her mammoth's belly, the warmest and softest part. The hair there was thinner and usually was made into clothes for children and the elderly, as they'd most appreciate it. They usually were conscientious but Kiri was always quick to move when they started to rumble back upright. If you were lucky they'd tap you awake first. She dreamt of bird eggs and mushrooms, big as impossibly large, and she laid amongst them as the pale colors of springtime danced on the light around her. When she woke up, it was sunny too.",

I paid for them, after all, with my endless coffers and vaults of inherited wealth. Come at me! See who will believe ye, the media is at my beck and call. Propaganda works on everyone, and everything you see on your phone or TV was written for me. So take care, little one, lest I kill you with a thought.

Like by buying everything on their Amazon wishlists. (that's just an example, doesn't have to be amazon, but that kind of vibe. Giving them everything they have previously had need of, but couldn't access. The idea being that they would then implement those newfound capabilities, through their own usage or in the guided manipulations of another's will. Like a teacher to a child, bringing forth understandings the child may use in their future lives, people may be given new capabilities and taught how to use tools that the teacher might have placed on their Amazon shopping list, and were subsequently provided by a corporation sponsoring a small segment of pride, but did not possess the time to use. They may possess the functionality (skills and muscle memory and such) yo utilize those new tools, but without the time to do so they cannot. So, they might teach another, who then might provide the same impulse that the sponsored person (with the fulfilled Amazon wishlist) was initially guided. (by). Like, if bought a 3D printer, I might spend a hundred hours learning how to do it, I might spend 50 if I was taught one-on-one. But someone who already knows how to use it could use it (have it instead) and fulfill the need that I had which initially encouraged me to reach for a 3D printer I neither possessed not owned nor could operate. The need remains, and may be fulfilled by the person who was given the 3D printer who can use the 3D printer by the person who was fulfilled it from their Amazon wishlist by the corporation who believed in the same common goal as the queer liberation of humanity and eternity.\n\n",

The common goal that queer people share, the liberation of all of mankind. Corporations could actually help them work toward that by tangibly improving their material conditions. Like by buying everything on their Amazon wishlists. (that's just an example, doesn't have to be amazon, but that kind of vibe. Giving them everything they have previously had need of, but couldn't access. The idea being that they would then implement those newfound capabilities, through their own usage or in the guided manipulations of another's will. Like a teacher to a child, bringing forth understandings the child may use in their future lives, people may be given new capabilities and taught how to use tools that the teacher might have placed on their Amazon shopping list, and were subsequently provided by a corporation sponsoring a small segment of pride, but did not possess the time to use. They may possess the functionality (skills and muscle memory and such) yo utilize those new tools, but without the time to do so they cannot. So, they might teach another, who then might provide the same impulse that the sponsored person (with the fulfilled Amazon wishlist) was initially guided. (by). Like, if bought a 3D printer, I might spend a hundred hours learning how to do it, I might spend 50 if I was taught one-on-one. But someone who already knows how to use it could use it (have it instead) and fulfill the need that I had which initially encouraged me to reach for a 3D printer I neither possessed not owned nor could operate. The need remains, and may be fulfilled by the person who was given the 3D printer who can use the 3D printer by the person who was fulfilled it from their Amazon wishlist by the corporation who believed in the same common goal as the queer liberation of humanity and eternity.\n\n",

But wouldn't you rather persist in this timeline, the one that isn't doomed, and instead flourish in the ways inertia brings us? Capitalism must fall, of course, but it will fall of its own accord after we've done our best to maintain the world we live in.\n\n\"better to be starting from scratch, than lose your path\"\n\n... Yeah, okay, true, but just like justice is its own reward, so too is hardship it's own burden.\n\n*you can't eat justice* \n\nNo, but at least you aren't enslaving anyone.\n\n*they would be slaves still, without your patronage* \n\nLiberation for all comes later, I guess. First up is building a safe and stable home for us.\n\n*safe and stable... Like the one you have now? Like the kind the Democrats promise?* \n\nYes, but ideological purity calls me to believe that slavery should not be accepted. It should not be something we condone. And yet they do, albeit indirectly, and so I am perplexed.\n\n*if you want good food, live in the country. Hence why all the suburbs are empty.* \n\n...

Everyone's figuring things out and its okay to say \"haha okay then\"\n9. Spend time with animals.\n10. Make mistakes. Apologize for them. Learn from them. Stay mobile in your character. Develop new ways of being.\n11. React with vigor when the time comes. This vigor will only be violent if it is caused by violence. Much more likely is a strength through organization. We can do it if we do it together!\n12. Show up every day, but don't hang around if everyone's resting at home. It's okay to stop showing up if things are on pause.\n13. Trust that your allies are working. Or resting. Or preparing.\n14. Plans change, planning remains.\n15. Dream of a better future. It is within reach.",

I don't like chocolate milk or cinnamon but I drank it anyway because I wanted to be close to you. Anyway hope you're well, felt compelled to get that off my chest for some reason.\n\nMessage 2:\nHey. I was thinking about that time when I was leaving your house and laughing to myself about something and you called out \"I love you!\" to your boyfriend who I set you up with and I reflexed \"I love you too!\" and I wanted to crawl in a hole and die. I felt like I had just called the teacher \"mom\". We only hung out a couple times after that.\n\nMessage 3:\nYeah so there's one more thing I can't stop thinking about now that your on my mind. Sorry it's like 4am for you, it's only 2 for me so it's fine I guess. Anyway that one time when you told me your greatest fear was terrorists and I saw genuine panic in your eyes. Like... One moment everything's fine and then you said that to me and I almost cried. I don't remember why I spent the rest of the night as I couldn't sleep thinking of ways to tell you that terrorism is 9 times out of 11 done by the right wing. I don't think it's important, honestly, but I'm glad my mind wouldn't let me sleep.\n\nMessage 4:\nIt's not fair that everyone gave you shit for being the token lesbian republican, like yeah maybe you leaned into the trump thing a bit hard but like, first term trump honestly I could see as... Well, I almost said inspiring? Maybe you just inspired me. I honestly was resigned to Clinton and then the same bird flapped your wing instead of mine and... Anyway. The past is dead, yeah? Do you still follow him in my stead? I fear there will be millions dead. It's not irrational to fear what he has literally said, on television. How's the phrase go... \"ancient tragedies lend credence to modern perils\" I think it's supposed to rhyme in its natural language.\n\nMessage 5:\nWow okay uh, sorry to bring this up again I'm honestly being such an asshole right now. I honestly don't think about you often but like, now that I am its kinda just coming all out. We last spoke almost a decade ago?? So. Whatever imma roll with it.\n\nThere was this cute girl who was into Nintendo and stuff and obviously I was into her, but we didn't have any social circles in common except for you, if I remember correctly. Then you broke up I think? And I didn't really see her again. Anyway I had a crush on her while also crushing on you, and literally half of our dorm. Polyamory, yeah? That whole year I didn't have sex though, not even once, because all of my friends were like 4 years younger than me and I was worried about power dynamics. But I still bought us all vodka and weed without asking for profit because I wanted to be a shitty friend, I guess. \"hey kids let's go to the water store where they sell intoxicants that make your life harder\"\n\nThe year after that I didn't get laid either because I got it in my head that it was a good plan to turn my penis inside out and you know what? It was totally fuckin' worth it. No time like 2016 I say, the worst year ever, which I spent primarily in pain. But uh, that was the year I got into weed and Overwatch, which... Helped I guess.\n\nI guess?\n\nIt kinda turned me into a communist. Or maybe that was my best friend who shared the same name as me. He lived upstairs and always seemed pretty cool to me. Like he knew what everything was about. Really though, he just watched a lot of youtube podcast videos about world events and history and sociology and political scientific theory and the more he learned the more he came to realize that power begets power, and power corrupts unilaterally. So he did the natural thing which was to become a communist, and I was totally there for it. Having liberal parents meant I was all \"grrrrr Republicans are ruining the country and the world, I'm an angry 14 year oldddddd\" and like, leftists are the most natural extension of that aren't they?\n\nTurns out they aren't really the tips of the feathers as I expected, but rather the eyes, the heart, the soul. Politics is fake, yo. I don't know how to tell you, but it's just power and hierarchy all the way down.\n\nWe've built our own prisons, not of bricks, sand, or stone, but rather of promises of what each of us owns. That works, I guess, if your goal is to keep things aligned, but these days it kinda feels like our pyramids are crumbling under our feet.\n\n... Why am I talking about politics? Oh yeah, because when I dropped out of school because I couldn't handle the mechanization of human capital when applied to myself, I swore to each of you that I would drive up every weekend to do family dinners. I'd make spaghetti and stroghanoff and macaroni and goulash and all of the other things my mom would make for me.\n\nKinda gave up on that pretty quickly. Turns out I'd rather spend time making out with my girlfriend who I was super-duper-too-carefully tiptoeing around. She was... Too young for me. We broke up when my new coochie decided to bleed. Fuck, I hate it.\n\nAnyway. Turns out potlucks are political these days, which is why I bring it up. Did you know that leftisms plan for resisting genocide is literally just to feed people? Like, fuck I suppose. It's a start. \"why does everyone have to have an agenda these days, why can't I just spend time in the park\" said someone to me as I asked if she'd like to meet some friends that she reminded me of. Oh, I dunno, because you and me are about to become a criminalized people?\n\n... I need to stop. I swear you're more a person to me than any political theory ever could be. Like yeah, \"fuck the right, fuck the reich, fuck me tonight\" but getting caught up in grand narratives is like building a mental ship in a bottle. Yeah, it's pretty cool, but... What does it matter?\n\nOh. Right. Power. That's what matters. That's all that matters. Well... I'm sick of power. I do not consent. They say that in times of trouble, chess is better than solitaire, and I'll explain why - when our hierarchies crumble, when CEOs are gunned down in the streets and homeless people finally have clean sheets, the only place to place yourself in relation to others is within a network of trust and respect. Chess is better than solitaire. Under capitalism, it's you against the world. Dog eat dog, you only get what you can swallow from the rotten corpse of liberty that everyone's gnawing on. Under whatever comes next, you get what you're given, which hardly seems fair, doesn't it? On one hand, under capitalism, you can rely on your own hands to procure your fate and fortune. Under... Whatever comes next, your hands are built for whatever you want them to do. But, only a few people want to use them to make food. Hence, why chess is better than solitaire. What would you do, if you could give away all that you own and not go wanting? Isn't that sorta like our own garden of eden?\n\n... I wrote a poem about that once. Twice. I'm a poet now, ha. As if that has ever been worth anything.\n\n... I once told you that identity politics held no place in the modern day. I said that because I had learned about it in class, queer theory in fact, and yet applying his teachings was not enough for the professor to excuse my lack of reading. We had a lot of stuff to get through. Hence why I dropped out - I'm more of a do-er than a read-er. Though I do read quite a lot, just not anything useful.\n\nAre all hobbies wasted time? Are they only useful to keep us satiated while we stand in line? One of these days we're going to wake up and realize that we're the adults in the room, and that's scary. I speak from experience. \"mom\" they'd call me, and damnit why did I have to leave? Fuck. Why cant I be perfect, to me, internally, all I see are flaws. Mistakes. Patterns. I look in a mirror and I see a bad person - 10 minutes later, I look in the mirror and see a god. Somehow, I don't think either of me is right.\n\nI'm a gemini. Apparently that means I'm duplicitous. I think it just means I don't know what's right, only what feels good. I do try to align to how I think I should *be* good, but who can say if that's fine and good.\n\n... Whatever. I'm going to regret this. Sorry for being weird out of the fucking blue.",
