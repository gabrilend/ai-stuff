in dominions, it'd be nice if we could set up permanent loops of commander
operations. Like, "move to this province, drop off units, move back, pick up
units there, then move to this province, etc"

think, factorio or spacechem. A more procedural generation of narrative events.
something that is more aligned to the fantasy because it's a story that takes
place across generations, as no religion's going to woo the world overnight.

it's gotta start somewhere.
