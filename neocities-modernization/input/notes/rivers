Your body is a river, from your mouth to your exits
Throughout there are many pathways and shores
As the tide goes up, the color of concentration goes up
And all four of you are made clear

Each act of consumption
is a ride down the river,
though broken into slivers,
and changed beyond recognition

The color is what defines the third eye
and beauty is beheld, what joys to be felt
While secrecy is bold, it's often held
So worry less and just go with the fold
