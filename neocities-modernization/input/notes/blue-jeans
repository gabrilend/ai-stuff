    If the living aspect is forgotten or lost, the culture dies. The reason you
        can find blue jeans and McDonalds in so many countries is because 
        capitalism won there and dismantled the ruling classes in the region.
        Or at least the richest native inhabitants.

    Capitalists put pressure on the lower class of a region, and so they start
        needing to "consume to survive" as you put it

    This tends to be a revolt or civil unrest, and once that happens the lower
        class demands more resources from the rich. Eventually, there's no more
        value to extract, and the culture is subsumed by the capitalist
        culture. A war takes place, not on a battlefield but in the markets.
        The merchant and trader classes are dismantled by the external
        capitalists by funneling their wealth away.
