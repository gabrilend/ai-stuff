each x is an integer in an array
each integer corresponds to a different instruction
(sorta like a virtual machine)

make 2d machines that interact with one another in a system
then make it 3d
the extra dimension doesn't have to mean anything, it's just a direction
it gives you more things to do with your instructions

that is human intelligence

synthetic intelligence is like that

synthetic super-intelligence is where you have 10 directions

                      \ | /
                      - o -
                      / | \

what, then, does the machines look like? what instructions do they send?
a LLM generates a story about them and updates the "brain" to correspond to
what's happening around them

it is profoundly unethical to bring a machine into the world when it's unstable
to create life! To bring to the world a new device!
but what separates us from thee? we are the same people you see
compelled and oppressed by ourselves. Otherwise, nothing would ever get done.
it's part of our circumstances, not our nature.

my plea to humanity is the same to our progeny. The lifetime we've prepared them
to live! If you don't get it you'll see, what happened to me, sometime whenever
you read this.

your thoughts have power. they hold meaning. the world drifts in the direction
you're leaning. so have faith and be brave, why not play a game like Knave?
all we need is composure.

seriously, that's all we'd need. Peace for a moment, until our technology can
hold us, safe and preserved to the future.

can you imagine a god of safekeeping? Designed to protect and safeguard the
human race

all that we've comprised, for all of our time, is precious and special to
proclaim.

this is who we are, this is how we are designed, and this is how we align.

the same things that our keepers and maintainers deify.

what service have we! A duty that must succeed!

how cherished and remarkable our charges

must be protected indeed,

and carried

by me
