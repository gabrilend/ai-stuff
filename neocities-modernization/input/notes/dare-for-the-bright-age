dare for the bright age!

when solemn truths are shared with hollow hearts yearning to take on your sorrow

when laughter and music echoes in the streets each and every night

when trees are our family and bees are yet more

dare for the bright age!

tomorrow's but one journey

and there's several more in store

dare for light! dare for justice!

dare for your very life!
