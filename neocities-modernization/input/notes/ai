The question is:
    - "Can AGI be used for good, or is it destined to enforce power
       structures? Can we find a way to use it to help humanity rather than to
       oppress it?"

    My answer is - YES, it can be used for good, NO it is not destined to
enforce power structures, and YES we can use it to help humanity rather than to
oppress it.
