like light or sound, soul is a wave. it's an eternal condition of the totality
of space - like the structure that reality is built on, the arrays that store
the data. The scaffolding on which we can sit.

time is a constant, to soul as it do

humans are a vessel for water that flows true

the soul in our body is vibrant and warm

it tells us of victory and trials by the storm.

it's beauty is unmeasured, it's renown so sublime,

that none may be adverse to us - we're killing our own time.

it's tragic how it's beauty, is treasured beyond all of our rupies.
condemn me to the slaughter, or listen to me like a father,

I care not.

Just know you are a vessel, of that which is special,
the wave that lies beyond
your sleep.

   - "he wondered if she dreamed, and if
      she dreamed, if 
      she dreamed the dreams he often dreamed."

         - Carrion, w7-8
