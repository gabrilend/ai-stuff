whoever fights billionaires essentially fights "whoever can be paid to do their will"

who-so-ever fights governments fights "whoever can be provided a comfortable life"

I believe all humans deserve to live in comfort

I believe people should not be tempted, with symbols of deserved wealth

and should instead find value, in the soul of the labour they work to do.

I'd *love* to talk to myself. If it was a truly accurate simulation. Alas, you'd need to write a LOT in order to generate enough to describe the fullest of mental pictures.

and plus, there's no guarantee that you'll cover ALL of "being alive" - it's essentially a state that you search for no matter what level of abstraction you operate upon.

Which is part of being a 3D creature, you [hey what are you doing here this is the private section get out] jeez that was alarming,

I think they know something I don't

don't know what

but I can guess

and I don't like guessing

I prefer much to know
