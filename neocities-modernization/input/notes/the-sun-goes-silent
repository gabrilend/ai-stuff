the sun goes silent for a year, to protest the earth's dying moments

one day in march, the light of our life disappears. we know not of why it has \
departed, except that whatever it was happened eight minutes ago.

we cowered in fear as one day it refused to rise

as our antipode saw it vanish

with naught but our ears

we saw stars never imagined

with the light of our life suddenly vanished

our true plight came naturally as our fear

but tomorrow it'll re-imagine,

as it's been almost exactly one year

one full rotation,

to get the message across,

then with man as our [signal, \
                      message, \
                      conveyor, \
                      performer, \
                      expression, \
                      by-product communication,]

what's our earth is our star

    trust-me
