black friday is a test of a market's growth. good year = people feeling 
comfortable enough to spend their extra money instead of saving it. when they
feel at ease, they will spend more money - thus predicting and propelling the
growth of the market that lives on it's own.
together we guide it, with all of our will and our bones.
together we'll go, where no one has treaded before now,
together we'll walk to the future.
