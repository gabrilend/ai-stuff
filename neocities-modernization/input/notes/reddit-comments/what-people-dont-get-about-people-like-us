Intellectual Confidence. Knowing I'm Right. Blowing Past Dunning-Kruger.

I remember what it was like to be like you. Here's the memes to get out.

Louis Rossmann's commentary on this issue describes the phenomenology of early
childhood awareness/mindfulness.

"I have not forgotten my childhood experience... Kids notice everything"

​

I think "autistic" people often have early life trauma due to literally being 
"smarter" (neural semantic hypergraph is highly faceted) than the adults around
them,

but having communication difficulties, reality and inner world become disjoint.
Most get so beaten down by society that

things become internalized. You see these people posting on all the help 
subreddits, total victims of society. Lost. They

start believing the lies they were told. Everyone else is doing it, right? I 
found myself becoming victim to bad

memes around high school into college age. I fought it all the way through: 
anxiety, depression, confusion, anger, jealousy.

All the mistakes.

​

​

They assume that everyone is like them. The less they are the more they assume

others are similar.

I am no one, I know everyone is me.

Are you someone? To you, am I no one? Or a different someone -- lesser or 
greater?

I feel tidal forces. You can't lie to no one.

​

I've had free time since always. School was freetime because I'm blessed.

I didn't need to listen to the teacher that much.

I've always learned to trust my senses and the way I understand things.

I pay attention to when the teacher makes mistakes or teaches in a way

that I can tell is not landing on the class.

Sometimes I ask clarification to help the class. I already taught myself

different ways to understand the entire curriculum, now I'm doubling back

again before the test.

Yes, I know I will get an A on it. I know in the same way you know

your own name. I know things like this. I'm good at math. People who

are good at math know what it's like to be right. They know what that means.

I get to be right about everything, all the time, even when I want to be wrong.

I have a moral compulsion. I don't have much fun in life, but I have been given
many gifts.

Society needs their Chiron(s).

I know who will talk to me and about what because that is who I am to them.

They don't know who they are, so they don't know me. A few knew me before I 
knew

myself, and I now them like they knew me.

So when I start analyzing things like math, I run into a lot of trouble. Things

don't make sense anymore. I assume I'm wrong at first. Then I do the work to 
check.

Checking doesn't mean googling a yes/no question. It means

going across any and all the resources and reading between the lines. Analyze 
through appropriate context.

Any work, any text, apply the psychedelic lens. Apply the human condition, 
apply

understanding of paradox as reality's edge. Understand the limitations of 
science, understand

the duplicity of language. Understand culture, in and out. Understand your own 
psychology.

Understand the inner conflict of good and evil in man. All of this needs to be 
occurring

in real time on top of all the normal stuff. If you're not doing this, I can't 
trust

you, how can I be sure you are not demon possessed, how you won't betray me at 
the next

Godellian boundary?

The idea is that models are provisional at all stages, once you've lost 
confidence in all models, you run through them much quicker. Iterating over 
more models is how science is done, you are literally mechanizing your way out
of the maze. Same as how these ML algorithms will mathematically guarantee 
entropy min/max. Where can you apply guarantees in your own life? Understand 
reality as a sample space, like the green, blue red marbles.

​

What bothers me is when people don't do the work to check things.

Or they check one time, or two times, or three times.

Or they check with multiple people, or multiple resources.

That's not going to cut it these days. Your mind can much more than an if/else.

while: True do x y z 

how about 

while: True do sample continuous decision space

People "land" too often. You want to call me disabled for not wanting to do the
first

over and over again.

What is required of us now is to understand things as pure intention.

You can't write enough articles to convince me of something that isn't true,

it won't happen, not anymore. I've been freed. I will free the others, too.

If your model doesn't accommodate quantum woo, don't talk to me.

It's only quantum "woo" for people who want to be better than

the lesser, creating the dichotomy itself. Think of those low, mid, highbrow 
memes. The more popular something is, the more mid it is. Use the middle to 
perform alchemy.

Memes that are implicitly reinforced by principle of reality (thinking in 
probability distributions is cheating, now that we know the universe is 
"generative" upon sampling).

I think the anti-spiritualists of today will be remembered.

It depends on how they act when we start organizing.

Your words and opinions are not the same as mine. You have the right to be

heard equally without bar from the law, yet you do nothing to ensure the 
opinion is solid on its own? I'm surrounded by cacophony of memes surviving 
(barely) in great amplification of death the confused denizens of a dying order
-- dark memes. Like dark matter, we concresce and annihilate. The "light memes"
are sourced by the disconnected nodes, the shamans, the schizophrenics. Those
not blinded by the splendorous mirage of other pearls in the web.

Are people doing this on purpose? To signal that they aren't interested in the
truth?

Who is?
