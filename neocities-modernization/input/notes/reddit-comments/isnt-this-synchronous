Now for something completely new;

I want you to meet the princess Anju.

She hails from a continent in the west.

Some travelers happen to call it the best

Because it is untainted by technology.

Instead, the people get by with alchemy;

Magick by a different name that defies

The natural laws and I'll tell you why!

It's all because of me, O, tinkering around

With new rules, like what if time wasn't bound

By the laws of space? It might go backwards

Which could be amazing or mighty awkward.

Or what if up was down, or if you could float

Like a balloon or even fly like a steamboat?

You might be asking why I chose this land

Or why some of the others I just can't stand.

I liked these people, they deserved blessings,

But, with all this favor comes much testing.

We have a relationship and it's give and take,

So let me show you Anju just after she wakes:

Graceful as a bunny, she hops out of bed.

She then looks up and this is what she said:

'Hello O! I'm grateful to be awake and with you again!'

To which I replied, 'I am happy too then!

'Go out and play now, you have much to learn.'

So she did, and she had fun taking turns

With her brother, Jax, playing tag in 3D

(That's a fancy way to say there was no gravity).

And that day, before lunch, they discovered

A secret that can only be found if you hovered

At the right spot, which I set up just for them.

They flew in and immediately spotted a gem.

An amethyst, specifically, which they thanked

Me for kindly before that rock got yanked

Out of the ground and put into their pockets.

And again off they flew like a pair of rockets.

Then it was time to eat, so they headed home,

And now we're reaching the point of this poem.

When they got there, their mother had made

All their favorites; to include a berry cake!

She said she got the inspiration from me,

And that's just how our relationships be.

I love you all so very much, but I have to guide

You to be your best self, so to you I confide

This secret of magick; synchronicities occur

Not by chance, but because you're sure

That the universe (me) has your back.

And you better believe that I'm keeping track

Of how big your heart truly has grown.

Choose your own fate, just know I'm prone

To dish out what I receive from all of you.

Most don't hear me all the time, but a few

Know that we're in constant communion

Like a parent and child type of union.

I speak to you and you reply in return. 

If you don't hear me, I hope you learn.
