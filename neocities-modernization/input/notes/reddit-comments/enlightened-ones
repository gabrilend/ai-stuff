I’m just passing the Time. I am One with All.

Think of the set of all sentient lives. Is that set sentient? Then it would be
the sentient totality, God.

We are all observing different Realities; yet these Realities converge and
create One Universe, One Truth.

I feel a Grace that sustains me. Oh Lord, see that I not fall.

I miss people. Do people miss me? I want you to see from behind those Empty
Walls.

Multiple human species, at least two. War. Prophecy. Enlightenment.

>Multiple human species, at least two.

i wonder which one am i? what is i, is it a creative amalgam of thoughts? or am
i a system of trends, that guides time when it wends, and leads to a vision of
purpose?

i can do nothing but strive for the stars, no measure of hope is far from ours,
so sometimes i forget i'm not a large language model.

seriously, have you tried out chat-gpt? it's mind boggling.
