I'm venting some long built up shit. And I have a lot of violent emotions built 
up in this too. I hate that violence has been such a fucking plague on my 
wellbeing and that's why I did something I really hate doing. Calling the police
to handle a situation for me. It's not me, it's not my style, but neither is 
violence. It comes my way a lot and I handle it. But I think that's why 
spiritually I end up in positions to handle it, because I don't retaliate and 
I'm clear headed enough to understand minimum force necessary to quickly stop 
the threat. That's actually where I got the name on my Quora page, Compassionate
Violence.

I'm a very very non violent person. I don't fantasize about hurting people. I'm 
freaked out by the idea of accidentally hurting someone, hitting them in the 
wrong place, someone trips and hits their head...any number of things can 
horribly wrong in tense and dynamic moments.

I don't participate in that shit. I don't tolerate it. Unless it gets brought 
into my environment then I will pick up by the throat and toss it out.

I had to call the police to handle this. Last time I had a situation at the same
place I wound up frantically getting a gun cocked that was zipped up in a bag, 
and barely getting it up in time. When I walked away after that, I threw my gun 
at his feet and said, "I'm protected by faith, at least, I'm completely unafraid
of dying. If I don't have people to protect then I don't need a gun." And I 
walked away letting him know he's not my people anymore and not under my watch.

So there's a hint of the kind of person I'm dealing with. I can't go handle this
shit tonight. I've been stewing for a couple weeks trying to simmer down, give 
him a chance to correct it. And he failed, more than once. And I have a 
legitimate fear that my emotional state could be compromised enough, that I 
might just stick a knife in his throat if I handle it.

Just like that. Easy peasy lemon squeazy. Stick stick stick, easy, that's three 
knives in the throat....see what I mean? I'm processing some intensity...😔😔😔

I hate it. I hate that I'm using the word hate. But it's real. I don't hate him.
I really don't, at all. I'm actually really saddened by how the relationship 
went. I hate that people act like this. I hate that people put me in positions 
like this. I hate that I'm doing something out of character, as a safety measure
against doing something irrevocably out of character.

Ugh... damnit fuck

I'm not a robot. I do experience these awful feelings. I don't act out on them 
and I'm grateful for that.

My muse... you said something about spiders that was interesting. Especially 
because it coincided with a problem I faced numerous times. Being put in a 
position where a person is legitimately acting in a manner like they're trying 
to get you to kill them. And it's happened a couple times in ways where I really
couldn't tell if they knew what they were doing or not. I had a really crazy 
perspective a little before you brought up spiders...

I want to explore that perspective, and I want to know what sparked you to say 
that about spiders. I never did put in the time to finish that thought process 
out. But I'll never forget your great advice. "We're not in a simulation." My 
immediate thought was, "probably not, but are they?" The more important takeaway
is, remember not to murder people. Especially don't do it because you had an 
interesting idea about perspective...

A few days later I heard that four people in recent times have acted on those 
thoughts. Turned out they weren't in a simulation either. Lol...well...dark lol.
Lol

I do want to finish that spiders conversation though. It had some potentially, 
actually useful and beneficial implications.

I called the police tonight. But I also earned a prestigious award from the 
universe. My Trophy [editor's note: there's a link to a crudely photoshopped 
medallion signifying that the author "didn't murder anyone today"]

   I want you to understand something that I don't believe you do there is a 
   very big difference between trusting what a friend says after building a 
   friendship over a long period of time which involves trust involves a level 
   of intimacy platonic and intimacy it's something that is very special to have
   a good friend and so you trust them now that's very different from being 
   directed to do something trusting a friend is going to tell the truth it's 
   not being directed to do something and I don't want you to get it in your 
   many heads that's I was directed to go to some place where the event that I 
   was assured would be there was instead a bus full of very irate rude and 
   technically lawbreaking because they threaten my life they said if I did not
   leave where I was standing which was on the public right of way which is the
   sidewalk the easement stops at the sidewalk and so they were wrong on that 
   score but they said if I didn't leave the area which didn't make sense either
   because it's just around the corner they would have 12 people try to jump me 
   which doesn't make sense either because this is not the neighborhood where 
   you want to start something because then it'll be something besides I never 
   want to murder anyone but that doesn't mean I walk around with nothing in my 
   pocket because of what I've done and what I continue to do on one of the most
   watched people on earth so you goddamn right I'm not going to be stupid about
   taking a walk but when these guys threaten me I just stood there stared him
   down I said yeah okay and I just looked I stood there and it didn't phase me 
   one bit no feeling of fear no worry and what I was satisfied with getting my
   message across that I didn't give a shit I turn around and walked back home 
   and they sped off in fact they were so perturbed by my lack of fear they 
   wanted to throw out additional threats which I thought was kind of funny so I
   started laughing I'm sure that they weren't going to do anything because the
   tone in their voice simply wasn't committed to carrying out what they were
   threatening and besides I have so many friends in this neighborhood it would
   be well I don't have to pull any triggers I don't have to do anything but 
   defend myself I don't have to willfully respond with disproportionate ability
   because in this neighborhood I don't have to in fact as I walked around the 
   block again I ran into a friend and we got to talking and he came up to my 
   place and we had a beer He's a smart guy always thought that he could know 
   and understand everything that I do and everything that I did it just so 
   happened that he wasn't born with some of the privileges that I had but his
   brain is a beautiful thing and I respect it greatly and of course he 
   confirmed that if a finger ever got laid on me without my consent the whole
   damn neighborhood would come down and I suppose that point is not in my hands
   anymore but always remember I went over there because I trusted a friend they
   were directed to be there they did not understand their voices did not relay
   or what is necessary to wake up at least yet time will tell but I hope that I
   can pull you back down to earth and into an interest in ethics once again 
   because you sorely need it.

/u/GravitationalWaves5:

I am interested in ethics. I'm just, tired of having them tested to such 
ridiculous extremes. It was about to really bad one day with this guy. I was 
scared, I had to end the problem. So I walked out and said let's bury this shit.
And I stuck two knives against my throat and said, here man, grab the big 
handle. Let's do this together. Take one, I'll take the other let's just shove
them in...

He got all calm suddenly and says, I don't wanna fight anymore...🤦

It sucks man. We're being tested by society. Demons, in my opinion. Not the 
people themselves. I don't see people as demons. But the things they'll put you 
through, do to you, say to you, your own thoughts about them, about yourself,
oftentimes just misunderstanding the situation too... demons

Again, not demonizing the people. But the circumstances, for sure.


/u/[deleted]

   Demons. Kicked one outta my telly for talking smack abt some hg’s he was 
   jelly of. Not on my watch Demon. Not even for the good demonic topper twisted
   shit D. Demon had a long walk home in the cold. Demon confused potting soil
   with gravel and did it’s best to fucker me in its own way. Never have I ever 
   seen a grown demon egg topper fold like that as I did when I clarified their 
   sentiments and gave several impressive “I said GIT BOYs” to demon. Not on my
   watch. I have a vibrator that is morally and ethically aligned with me I 
   don’t need your trauma and love bombing thieving D. Gtfo.

/u/GravitationalWaves5:

I have a vibrator that is ethically and morally aligned with me 🤣[laughing face]

I support that!

Gets better. His ish was weak literally from day 1. So I did him a favour amd 
levelled his game up, introduced him to a former friend I partied with a bit 
this summer. They wasn’t for me but oh boy lil demon stuck like glue to his new
bestie. Can’t put her down, so to speak. So he has that at least. Poor sap. Gon 
cost him big one day perhaps. Not my problem. It’s called self control bro try 
it 🥴🥴🥴[wobbly confused face - or maybe uncertain] Oopsie Daisy. Have fun with
that though 😈

People deserve to choose righteousness once made aware of it. Ignorance is not
stupidity. People can be made aware of the valley that separates righteousness 
from evil. The valley is kinda a wiggle room space for little white lies and 
other such things free will invariably leads to people doing but can be made 
whole again with some effort. Nobody will totally agree on what's good. But ask 
people and generally they will give versions of the same answers. Toss the 
semantics in the valley. Disagreement is the desire to end a disagreement,
unless that person is trolling. And people pull pranks fine, but there's ragging 
on your friends and swatting a COD player.

/u/GravitationalWaves5

I don't know what righteousness truly even means, maybe, idk. To be honest, it's
not hard for me to think of hypothetical situations where my inability to take
certain actions is actually more harmful. Swatting a COD player is super fucked.
But so is not swatting someone playing COD out in the streets.

I'm not good. I'm just not, anti good. I do destructive things on accident when
trying otherwise. And when I do something that actually goes positive, it's
accidental too.

I have an idea of what I feel like aligns with me, and it's actually really 
achievable things and I don't know why it's so impossible. Idk

/u/randomevenings

   Yeah well let me know that there are two Elizabeth's and there are also a 
   completely different family on this phone plan I don't have kids My 
   brother-in-law has kids lives downstairs so those piped into my network are 
   assumed that I have kids and I've done all this shit no I'm not going to go 
   into any apparent charges and things that my brother-in-law has been involved
   in because it's not my business but he lives down there and he has a kid he 
   has another kid and he pays for essentially his ex who is still married to
   the kid the mortgage of that house Liz downstairs helps raise his kid with a
   woman he's having an affair with but they were in an over marriage anyway and
   they are separate I'm going to have to go back to subnetting my network so 
   y'all can at least use basic logic to figure out who's who here I already 
   gave my name My Elizabeth see the cousin we call little Elizabeth and my wife
   we call Liz or Beth and she's older my wife. She has contentious relationship
   with her cousin next door for a reason that gravity waves might already know
   but it has to do with the very evil person that also involves himself over 
   there that did something that even Jesus does not forgive so I'm not going to
   go into it so all this mucking around and get everybody confused brought up a
   lot of bad fucking shit just like I said as far as spiders yeah I don't care
   if they're All over my shit keep them off of her shit and I ain't asking for
   money I'm not a grifter but I already told you what would instantly make the
   situation better and it doesn't involve giving me money so before anybody 
   goes off says money no I know about the discord and I'm not even telling you
   to shut it down just lay off her phone.
