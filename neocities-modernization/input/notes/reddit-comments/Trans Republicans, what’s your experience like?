│My political ideology is different enough from the liberal zeitgeist that I   │
│figured I might as well comment even though I'm not exactly a "republican"    │
│                                                                              │
│I believe some far left things, and some far right things, and frankly I find │
│the distinction a little arbitrary most of the time. It'd be nice if there    │
│was an easy way to bundle political perspectives into respective boxes that   │
│could be applied in generalized situations, but the real world just doesn't   │
│work like that.                                                               │

│I haven't tried to find any, but I imagine it'd be about as difficult as      │
│finding any other person. If you mean "do you have trouble finding politicians│
│to support" then you should understand that politics is just a popularity     │
│contest. No matter who wins, nothing will really change. I don't support any  │
│politicians.                                                                  │

│In America, we have two political parties: liberal, and neo-liberal. There's  │
│no denying that liberalism has touched every country in the world, and there's│
│a reason they wear blue jeans in Africa and eat McDonalds in Japan.           │
│                                                                              │

│I believe in leftist libertarian ideas for economics like workplace democracy │
│and solarpunk style idealism.                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│I'm against international free trade because I believe it concentrates wealth │
│when we should be focused on building ecologically sustainable productive     │
│capacity across the world. However I also understand that many countries      │
│simply don't have access to certain materials and cannot sustain themselves at│
│a 21st century level without trade. So there's gotta be a middle ground       │
│somewhere, but we're so far to the right that I believe it's alright to be    │
│against international free trade in 2021.                                     │
│                                                                              │
│ > what are some examples of far right beliefs that you hold?                 │
│                                                                              │
│For culture, I believe we should strive to be united rather than fractured.   │
│Diversity is a form of strength, but we've been incited against our countrymen│
│by the ruling class wielding the media and so we're primed to shatter. I      │
│believe it's of the utmost importance to reconcile our disparate selves before│
│we break. Generally I think the best path for that is patriotism, because     │
│nationality is something that everyone shares. Gotta avoid nationalism though,│
│so that's something to keep in mind.                                          │
│                                                                              │
│I believe culture is DEscriptive rather than PREscriptive. For example I      │
│believe queer people are as much a part of American culture as baseball,      │
│cowboys, and plinking with a .22 long rifle.                                  │
│                                                                              │
│If you DESCRIBE a country's culture, you get a picture of what to fight for   │
│and protect. If you PRESCRIBE definitions for what a culture should look      │
│like, then you're applying authoritarian rhetorical structures to what should │
│be a natural evolving organic system of human experience.                     │
│                                                                              │
│If I had to define my political ideology I'd say it's "anti-authoritarian",   │
│but even that's not quite correct because I acknowledge that on average       │
│people are pretty stupid (myself included) so there's gotta be some           │
│regulation or guidance. All I can say is a prerequisite of ethical governance │
│is for everything to be in balance.                                           │
│                                                                              │
│Liberty, justice, and freedom for all.                                        │
│                                                                              │
