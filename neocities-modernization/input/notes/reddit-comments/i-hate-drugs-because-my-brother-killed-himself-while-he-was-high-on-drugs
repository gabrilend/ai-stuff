WARNING: This post is about covid. This post might piss you off.

    My brother was playing russian roulette on and shot himself in the head
    because he was so high on drugs. That's why I hate drugs

Ironically the chick who tells this story is a youth counselor who totally looks
like a hippie.

I was the first in my town to wear a mask when the talk about a looming pandemic
came about.

    They were cheap.
    "people looking" isn't something I worry about much
    I was doing Wim Hof breathing and figured breathing through a piece of
      tissue would be a fun challenge.
    Why not?

Big brawny brave strong men who got hissy fits about wearing a mask still amuse
me.

I took my first covid shot because "why not".

When there were news about the first world hoarding the vaccines I thought 'Well
that's retarded. Don't they know what "pandemic" means?'

When there were news about someone suggesting making the vaccines patent free to
have a chance of actually vaccinating the whole world, and the pharma giants 
just went "Naw, we ain't doing that", I thought 'Well that's retarded. Don't 
they know what "pandemic" means?'

I took my 1st booster shot because "Yeah. Ok. It's technically free, I guess".

When there were news about the third world not affording vaccines because the 
first world is hoarding booster shots, I thought 'I can't believe that nobody 
understand the definition of the word "pandemic"'.

At this stage it's impossible to tell who's fault it is that your dear nana 
passed away from covid in the healthy young age of 87. You can blame your MAGA
uncle if you must.

I hate MAGA because my brother shot himself in the MAGA hat while wearing it*.

If you don't love democrats, I fucking hate you and want you to shoot yourself 
in your stupid fucking MAGA hat*.

Because everybody knows that democracy is a choice between two parties: good or 
evil*.
