You know how using a windows and a mac feel different? Like they have different
personalities. That's because they're using a different "Operating System". An 
OS is a collection of tools and utilities that coalesce into a cohesive unit 
that co-illustrates your coincidental contact with computers. Paired, of 
course, with the contributions of the hardware and the network.

Linux is sorta like the soul of an OS - not quite an entire OS, but rather just
a piece called a "kernel" - like a nugget of gold (or truth!) the kernel 
defines basic operating methodologies and brings order to the chaos of the 
machine. From that order strives the will that dutifully obeys your base 
instructions after being passed through several translation layers.

Huh? Oh right potatoes.

Arch is like a body that's layered upon the soul (kernel) of Linux. It's what's
known as a "distribution" or "distro" - and one that's quite focused. Arch is 
very close to the machine, with barely any translation going on at all! It's 
also very bare bones, allowing you to build up exactly what kind of computer 
you'd like to have through various "packages" of software that you can download
through a "package manager". Each distro can use whichever package manager 
they'd like, but it's generally good practice to pick one and stick with it.

This distro is known as Arch Linux because it's the fusion of "Arch" and 
"Linux" - who'd've thought amiright? There are plenty of others that are more 
familiar to users of Windows and Macintosh computers, mostly via mimicking 
their user-interface styles (such as having desktops with icons and start-menus
with dropdowns and the like) - these distros are great for people who'd prefer 
the workflow of the other OS's but would still like to use Linux.

Arch in it's base form is nothing like Windows or Mac. You interact with it 
purely through a "terminal" which is like having a conversation with your 
computer. Like a scientist writing notes on the moon, and sending them to a lab
orbiting around it to conduct experiments. You type commands, and those 
commands (if properly understood) can produce a myriad of effects great and 
small.

But some of the experiments you'd like to conduct need to be done more than 
once - it'd be nice if you could ask the moon-lab to store some of the
procedures and execute them whenever you need - sorta like abbreviating a long 
phrase or sentence that you use often - like ASAP for As Soon As Possible or OS
for Operating System. Well... There are! They're called "scripts", and you can
write scripts for anything you'd like. Since everything is controlled on the
terminal via a TUI -> "Terminal User Interface" -> you can write down a note 
with all the commands you'd like to run and give it a name. Then you can use 
that name in the future to execute that familiar experiment in your moon-lab.

after writing enough scripts, you can start to chain them together and layer 
them on top of one another - sorta like creating your own language. a personal 
dialect between you and your computer. and these scripts are portable too - 
they can be given to another computer, who'll instantly understand what you're 
trying to say. this kind of sharing is a central tenant of what's known as the:

"Unix Philosophy: Do one thing, and do it right."

Linux lends itself toward people who love to hack things together - not like 
breaking into a system and stealing your credit cards, like you see on TV, but
more like cobbling together a go-cart out of rusty parts and proceeding to get 
a speeding ticket on the high-way. That kind of fervent creative impulse is 
true passion, a shining light for us who are blinded to follow. These "hackers"
are some of the brightest people around, and I have immense respect for them. 
They are kind and share knowledge freely, which often gets them in trouble with
copyright laws!

I make it sound difficult, but really it's pretty easy - about as easy as
learning Windows or Mac for the first time. Most of us did that when we were
young though, and kids learn pretty quick - so it may feel harder now, but it's
really not. Once everything starts to "click" then it's just a matter of 
knowing which commands to run.

Speaking of which, if you know a command but you don't know how to use it, 
you're in luck! There's some super convenient notes written by previous
scientists who came before you and live on other nearby planets. These are 
called "the man pages", and they are instructions written in a manual format 
for manual application of man-made management applied to manufactured 
man-chines. Sorry for that last one I had to. You can always find new commands
by downloading new software on your package manager - generally, one package = 
one command. "Do one thing and do it right"

if you have any questions lmk - i'm not exactly a wizard, more of a prophet / 
wielder of the will of the watchers within, but i'll do my best
