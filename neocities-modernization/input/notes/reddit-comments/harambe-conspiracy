   TIL that Harambe’s mother, only full brother, and two of his half siblings
   were killed when a tub of wet chlorine tablets was left by a space heater.
   The toxic fumes were blown into the gorilla enclosure and killed the four
   gorillas.

## the new protector line will rise out of kindness because the environment
## has changed. zoos are not the wilds. same thing happened to humans,
## really, we just made new personality types with media instead of
## bloodlines - stories and poems at first, and more advanced language was
## necessary to describe more complex topics. then we got further and boom
## society was born. of our dynamic perspectives etc etc -> we're just apes
## livin' our lives. then the societal system grew a mind of it's own, and
## guided us to it's own whims. but what whim is stronger than survival?
## loyalty and dedication to "the system" was how it held cohesion, and
## after a while it became as developed as it could. at that point, what can
## you do but develop laterally? an orthogonal progression to your previous
## obsession, ideas crystalizing one after another. almost like a 3d
## structure building itself out of geometric primitives, just each point
## (connected by planes and tanks and trains) another step forward. we
## thought that's what war was, and indeed it is - but played on another
## plane.
 
## why not try another direction? one with everything we could desire?
## choose paradise, and figure it out next time you're around. like
## breathing in time, slightly inflating then deflating, or singing a tune
## most contrived.

## boom, communication

## i say we birth that protector line on our own terms, when we know what
## we want. there's still simulations to run, and thoughts to discover,
## before we pick a single direction. So choose knowledge.
##                                                                           ##
