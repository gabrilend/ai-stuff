Movement is the nature of all things.
The essence of things is what lies between.

Everything comes together, while things fall apart.
The many become one, and are increased by one as one among many.
The cosmos weaves.

A creator is as much created by the act of creating as a creation.
There is no creator, and no creation, instead co-creativity between the many.

The entire universe dies and is reborn in the present moment.
The ash of the past endures, while the future allures.

Life is a wager by an organism about the possibility of success.
To seek the unanticipated is the ultimate life-affirming act.

life co-creates creatively,
and ash whorls perpetually,

yet as one our dreams,
    of caches of latent desires
filled up to the seams
    with endless circling pyres
align in designs of the eternality.

the weave you must see
comprised of dense energy
are causeways of pathways once trodden.

coursers are we, and corsairs to be!
aligned in designs of our plying.

ripples make we, and starlight we see,
alone but for our compiling.
