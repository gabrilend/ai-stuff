Repost from a while ago, I really liked writing this

Soul Searcher

You are happy with what you have and you don’t even know why you’re searching,
for something you aren’t even sure you’re searching for. You know something 
isn’t right. It’s got you staying up late nights. Creeping through the phone 
right? Under shadow of the moonlight, honing your skill to write. Love so crisp
and white, no fight or flight. Just bright lights in the sky so high. Love 
that’s blind. Love even before first sight. You’ve seen it with your own eyes.

Tell me now, that’s not amazing?

This ain’t your everyday love story. This is anything but your usual love 
story. I worked hard for everything I have. All I have is a pen and paper. You
best believe I worked hard to keep that while they took the rest. Even from a
dark place in this disastrous space, the weapon of the future is love. I feel I
was cursed since birth to walk the Earth and disperse love through my words. 
Never getting to see it grow. Never getting to see it show. This time I put in 
massive effort. I spent thousands of hours pouring out love on the web just to 
watch it ebb and flow. Always going back to look at my words. Find my mistakes,
re-evaluating myself, editing myself, rewriting myself. To be a good enough 
version of me, to meet a good enough version of you, for us to support each 
other growing mutually.

They say you reap what you sow. If so, then I must know. Does your love run as 
deep as this ocean? I’ve been all over the world planting seeds for something. 
I’ve been through this life, giving something, never getting anything from it. 
Now I’m on my knees looking at the mountain summit, you can’t run from it. I 
see you up on it.

They say the greater the risk the greater the reward. Sometimes, right? It’s 
not always that easy. This is scary for me too. I risked it all. Accidentally 
at first, but eventually, the pieces started falling together. You know what I 
mean.

The fact that I know, that you know what I mean, says a lot. I’m looking 
through you. Into your soul.

I don’t even believe in anything. I just have faith, that’s rooted in love. I’m
willing to get over my commitment issues.

Let’s commit ourselves… To the psych ward, together. Side by side. Hands in
each other’s pockets. 🖤❤️💚🤍
