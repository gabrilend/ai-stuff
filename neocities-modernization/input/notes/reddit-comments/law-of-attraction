Spiritual teachers diminish/obfuscate/complicate the real work it takes in
understanding Law of Attraction.

I personally didn't think it was real until I started changing myself. The
quality of my spirit and existence has gone from hell up to blissed out mode,
and now everything starts coming together in mysterious ways with innumerable
synchronicities along the way.

The most simple explanation, and it doesn't require any action from a distance 
(woo), is that life does indeed mirror you and that other people around you
mirror you.

Your thoughts/emotions will mirror to you, your spiritual issues and
conscience.

Your state of being mirrors those emotions, which takes much longer to
form/change than thoughts/emotions.

Your overall drive mirrors the state of being, which determines the trajectory
of your life's course.

The friends you choose are on the same spiritual hangups you're on, most
likely.

The way in which people react to you, is mostly based on how sociable you can
be.

Your opportunities only happen successfully, when you're completely prepared
for them to occur.

Most importantly, your life mirrors the potential you agree to exercise within
yourself.

Just imagine building a rocket to send astronauts into space. You're absolutely
required to waste thousands of man hours in order to fail at what you're doing
and have to start over, so that you can revise over and over again, a perfect
rocket.

You are always shedding off old versions of self in the same way. It's called
Positive Disintegration, or Solvet Et Coagula.

Once that rocket gets going, that's when it starts to really pop off. And
you'll get there, if you just keep trying.
