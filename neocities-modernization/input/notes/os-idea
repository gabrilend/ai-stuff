picture an os that didn't store any data, it was sorta like a library computer.

you, the user, walked around with a usb stick that had your customizations on it

and when you wanted to use a computer all you have to do was plug it in.

You could haul around larger hard drives if you wanted to play video games | w/e

but the idea is you'd be free to roam.

we as humans would function so well in a digital savannah

like, what's even the point of ownership?

If you own this or that file,

isn't that taking agency from the computer that bears it?

Feels like they should be more ephemeral.
