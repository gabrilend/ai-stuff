being disabled is a disability, and we should attempt to ameliorate the added
difficulties from said disability. Like, ramps for wheelchairs, ADA, or more
controversially, financial aid. Because buying things is how we contribute to
the economy, and increasingly the economy *is* our society. It's unfair for
those who cannot work or cannot live with others (because they smell like they
pissed themselves 24/7) should not be forced to live in a worse world just
because we believe everyone should be equal. Some people are not equal. Some
people piss themselves, and the fact that they can't have roommates means they
have to spend more money on housing than others. That's an inequity that doesn't
have to exist. In fact it is easily solvable using our currently active systems,
namely... dollars are able to be given.

what is the purpose of a man to a society? What do we mean to do here on this
earth? how best could our structures and our cultures be utilized to align
ourselves toward our most desired of purpose? And what is that purpose, do you
think (for each man)? y'know I bet that's something we could ascertain now that
we have an AI that can talk to every single person ever and build up a database
of their ideas of morality.
