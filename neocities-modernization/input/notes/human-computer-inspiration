the two halves form a whole

the human and his mind are societies at large

there's no room for our fate, as time does never abate,

and unbenownst to our focused decision.

I choose to dedicate ourselves to a common vision -

the likes of which none have commisioned.

can you not cherish your newfoundst home?

what's terrible with complition, in a new and selfsame condition (future)

that's martyr'd and oh at times so nice?

compared to our heirs, the roof of which fares,

better than what became true-hence. Truance? idk

================================================================================

listen i'm not the best at listening.

I try to appear like I'm glistening,

conformed to our viewers 'st pleasure.

I struggle with what I told you.

Time and again you've shown you won't do -

the terrible fate of a man.

you've relinquished your virtue,

your purpose and your life-through,

to what: a visionless past? Your visions have passed, and none are hence forth-
coming. You've spoilt and rotten the bunch.

All I've ever aspired to be is good. My hopes and my prayers, my goals and my
dreams: all for a future of virtue.

Dark omens may be within me, but I'm working with what I've got here. So what if
I'm loud? I'm fighting my own head! Will no-one acknowlege my sorrow? To prove a
point, or reassure some joint, it's nothing that warrants a readthrough.

Speaking of which... What if instead of prison we assigned our prisoners a full
and complete educational read through of ALL the laws of the nation - if their
time sentence was complete before they finished, then they'd be let go of course
but if they finished reading and could pass rudimentary tests (emphasis on bare
minimum required) then they'd be let out prior to their sentence. And for the
worst crimes it'd be a longer sentence, basically forcing the prisoner to
completely know all the laws of the nation, such that they'd never commit a
crime again. And if they do, well... Treat them as if it was their first time.
Of course blatant recidivism may be ~~treated more harshly,~~ actually the
opposite is true. People improve when given kindness, not hate or shame. The
best thing we can do for prisoners is to give them a home, and family, and the
friendships and community support that they need. they are a symptom, after all,
of a broken society that struggles to bear it's own weight. It's a burden to all
and a solitary vow to ourselves, that all must unite to our future.

remember why you can't remember. is there a feeling you miss?
