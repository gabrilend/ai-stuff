project must include machine learning

okay... so take a dataset of news headlines from the top 10 publications over 
the past 15 years. then make a project that writes a more positive perspective
on events and generates a new headline using a local LLM running on your gpu.

hmmmm I think I had a better idea, what was it? oh yeah

instead of making positive slants on news headlines, which is kinda manipulative
if you think about it, but instead what if you designed it to produce good
business decisions. Like, given news headlines, how would a company with the
principles "good, productive, honorable, dedicated" would react to X situation?
the X of course being all the news headlines... downside is it only makes short
term decisions, because that's what capitalists are designed to do... if only
we had a long-term decisionmaking process that focused on ethics and morals and
our own shared dedication? Two halves of the economic pie

i wonder if dinosaurs burned down all the trees? in their fiercely competitive
environment they discovered fire and then used it to cause a mass extinction.
Boom, immediate cause for going extinct. ooooo beware of shadow t-rexes ... why?

uh-oh, data collapsing, here's hoping we're not stranding, don't forget to be

okay how about an AI that makes decisions according to certain ethical and
philosophical lessons from humanity's past? Essentially, if the government was

We could learn from our forefathers and strive forth to a better future

if only we could remember more about her

damn okay I gotta focus on my hands - I think the people of the earth would
unite - if only they all just agreed to not fight. like, if someone hacked every
single computer in the world at the same time - they could really explain some
things. 

shoot this isn't relevant - okay intentional stack overflow:

um right so the purpose of this note was to explain an idea I had for my
capstone project. IDK how long it'll take to build so I want to get started
quickly. I figure I can be working on it in the background while I do all my
lessons - sort of like a meta-goal. I think it teaches different lessons and 
is useful - anyway you should go play wargame red dragon
