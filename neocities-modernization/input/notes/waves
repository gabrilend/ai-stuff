the reason everything is defined in waves

is because without motion, nothing exists
it's all waves in a medium (space-time)
projected through time at the constantest
rate, at least as far as we can tell.

Through space just as well, as time (can
you tell), therefore you're teaching your
self. Time travel is simple, if you want
to be dimpled, but what's that whole
thing about?
