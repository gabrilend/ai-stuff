I lived here

I worked here... and here

my dad lived here

I also went to college here

I lived up here... and here

I miss my home

I'd skii here

keystone was my favorite

I did LSD for the first time in these mountains

I also worked up here

(growing weed right next to a nature preserve)

doh

my family used to live here (less than 10,000 people

in the big horn valley

I was born here

in the fading light of the Sandia Crest

I've lived in all parts of America, east, middle, and west

I like them all for different reasons

this is where you live

at least, that's what I've heard
