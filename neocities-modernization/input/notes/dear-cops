dear cops

can we just like, opt out of your protection?

like, we as a community can care for our own. Once we've gotten to know one 
another there's... really not that much crime. It honestly feels like an issue
that's been solved for a while? Eh well we'll figure it out one day.

but, I do however, think we need paladins.

do you see the difference? between a shining stalwart beacon of justice, to the
well, I guess you could think of them as... bandits who don't steal? it's a
question of temperament, like how you engage with the world. Some people are
just doing their jobs, and some are very sarcastic. I don't know I have known
like, two cops my entire life. I'm sure there's a lot more personality types.

but paladin is one of them.

I feel like... they should be the ones we trust with our arms?

and yes I understand that everything is corruptible,

and that fiction and literature has shown us time and again the path evil could
stalk

but in these dear pages there are kernels of truth - meanings and wisdoms for
the future. And each of these musings are precious, like kindling. Fuel for the
light of life's spirit. That which keeps us moving forward and alive, it's
necessary for us to live as we've designed. Or rather, in some shining new way.

we can define the narratives of our nation, our country, our home

we can define the ways in which people interact with one another, defined in one
massive tome.

these laws that define are important to adjust, we as humans must find our own
ways to be most comfortable.

there's one path to the present, and that's to learn to live with our hope.

have you ever played Stellaris?

================================================================================

I love cops, just saying. I don't like the power they hold, but that power is
put in their hand by the government and the people who run it. Who runs your
government? Do you talk to them? Are you friends? If your lives are
exceptionally different, you might misunderstand the perspectives of reality.

... meaning the political climate. the two different ways people see things.

(much more than two different angles to view the same problem, but yeah. some
 people specialize, some people are more robust, it just depends. but like,
 who cares right? we're all friends and together and on the same side.

that of humanity, of course.
