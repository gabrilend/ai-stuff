desalination plant that works by aiming sun mirrors at a copper tube, barrel, 
basin, or vat-with-heat-distributing-tubes-running-throughout but painted black
on the outside, to absorb heat. The saltwater that is pumped inside/through is
heated, evaporated, and allowed to flow through, to help carry away sediments
that would otherwise build up if the entire device was designed to fully
evaporate the water.

the condensation is gathered and pumped to misters which spray platters of moss
that grow into edible shapes to create "Unitary Basic Food" which gathers
carbon from the atmosphere and delivers nutrients (supplied through the mister)
to the human or otherwise who eats it.
