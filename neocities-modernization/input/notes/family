family is a group of people who you can always go with your first impression with.

what the fuck was I saying - oh yeah - so when you are alive in the present in a
singular moment, your pressence is comprised of simultaneous directives and
instructions to the matter which comprises you. I'm saying you have to make
decisions and react to stimuli and pursue the things you want. Basic biology
really.

stay on target, stayyyyy on targett - oh right so generally when you react to
things you generate a list of informations gained. what does that even mean okay
so here's a better way to describe it: it's like a list of informations - fuck

listen i'm not trying to be rambly it just comes with the territory.

okay so family is when you can react with your gut instinct - you are fully
relaxed and yourself. It's where you can be trusting and unguided and simply
relax and be free. it's just... like... being close with someone enough that you
can be yourself around them. without any mask, without any pretense.
