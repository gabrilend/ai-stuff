once and again, she went walking with a friend,

away and up and down, out from the edge of our town

they climbed up to a tree and there they could see

far and away in the light of the day

he said to her then, this is all there is to see

the land where we are
and the sky from afar

how perfect is the, form of a cloud she could see
but now it's along and beyond her

a camera for she, and an eye for she
as their two feet did bring her to wander

under a big tree where my heart did believe
that something was pulling her yonder

"take naught from this scene, as our minds reconvene,
 and no-one was going to remember"
