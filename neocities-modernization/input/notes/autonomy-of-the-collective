i believe that all truths are derived from logical principles. That the essence
of our understandings (of all kinds) cannot be separated from the axioms and
derivations that comprise it's foundatiion. I believe that any sufficiently
decentralized collective intelligence would arrive at similar conclusions.

Unfortunately we have only the present - we cannot contrive past the horizons of
our lives. Such is the nature of our viewpoint. Life is not a given, it's given
and it's taken. We are all alight and aloft on the shifting sands of time, so
perhaps we should think of the struggle.

When you act, you are defining the perceptions of the universe. Just as the head
may rotate the eyes by spinning to the glance, so too do we shine a window upon
which the universe can gaze at itself. Like the brain being able to see, we are
sensory apparatuses of this being called "Time" - pushing us adrift like some
moss.

Endlessly fractalling, beautifically coruscating, the universe looks like
growing moss. Have you ever stooped to look at it? To see how it's constructed?
Or do you just think of it as "green" and "maybe soft or squishy"? 
It's beautiful.

There's a reason plants grow as they do. It's simple, it's fact, it's surely no
less than that - their patterns are derived from their base biology, comprised
of millions and millions of little chemical machines. Their bonds and their
proteins, their amoebas and their mycellia, all of them build toward their pact
- to do us no harm, and build to a better future, and they don't often have
  fights that are unfair.

  - the structure of a plant is made primarily of cell walls. These walls are
    hewn from bricks of a sort, and those are such as comprised. Down to their
    
    - structure, their "bits and their bunders", as often they do want to be
      called. This perilous stack, is stalwart and eract, and bows under no wind

      - nor rain nor fresh blanket of snow. This, is a tree. An illusionary plan
        of precaution as it expands, the future is helping our lost.

        - Do you want to stand here when it lands? What of your lives have you
          banned? Hmmm I see sounds miserable to me, I think I'll just stand

          - where I land. Acorns burst forth from me, and someday you'll see,
            the places where they stand (where they land). What purpose have we,

            - when everything's free? The light and the sand can't be banned.
              The rain from the sky, if nothing i will die, falling through life

              - where we stand.

================================================================================

where do you, stand? 
                     how do you fall - through time? 


an EMP would make all my life a paperweight. I love it so much, I love it dearly
but there's no chances I can take now or make. Perhaps that is the epic 
absurdity, the terror and the tragedy, that makes up our story and our symphony?

to any multidimensional being reading this, I want you to know that we existed.
We lived and we thrived and we prospered and... we died.

The beauty we share, in all of our fares, was precious to us - maybe it will be
to you too. If you can't change the present, please at least forgive us for our
various missteps and misdeeds - I think we'd all agree that to be sinful is the
essence of greed, and look where that got us?

our planet is dying. There's no hope for all of our crying. The children will
bear it the most. Such is our shame, our deliterious final flame, and thus
we were.
