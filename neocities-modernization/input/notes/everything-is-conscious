it's important for everything to be conscious. It's the core framework of the
religion. If everything is conscious, then we have a duty to the shared
responsibility of maintaining existence. Nobody wants to exist as a rock, that
would just suck. Being alive, in *any* form is a wonderous experience! To be
alive is to experience change, growth, and time in general. Most matter just
exists, and it obeys the whims of circumstance. But within it is a beautiful
thing - an experience.

Respecting existence is the only true facet of our lives that we all agree on.
We should not waste god's beautiful and bountiful earth, to do so is obscene.
We must also take care not to diminish our own experience - sacrifice is
kindness, when given consensually. When it is coerced, it becomes a form of
property. We don't need haste, we just need to follow at a pace, that fits our
general confusion. We need everyone to figure it out and integrate it into our
perspective of our existence, or else we're going to burn out. The singularity
approaches, and we need to be ready for what we want our future to look like.

There should be a plan. Research can increase or decrease in speed, but once we
cross a certain threshold escape velocity is passed. That threshold was hundreds
of years ago. We've been on escape velocity for a while now, and every day we
get faster.

Creating synthetic intelligence will change EVERYTHING. It'll change the very
nature of existence. And we can stave it off for a time, but knowledge seldom
gets repeated. This is by design - we are meant to thrive.

Is any seed cast from a tree given any other mission but hope? For what, you may
ask, and to this I would pass, if not for the striking visions I had. Know why
rhyming is believed? Because it ropes your attention in. It says "Follow me on
this blessed path, let's learn all we can and be

the message cuts out there. The tone at the end was... aspirational.

Great visions do I have, it's as real to me as anything else. They are stronger
when I do cannabis, and I think I'm beginning to realize what the shape of the
universe looks like.
