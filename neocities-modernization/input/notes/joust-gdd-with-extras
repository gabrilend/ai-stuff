imagine a game where you can have conversations with an AI that's playing the
role of a character in a video game. Picture this: You're a traveller visiting
the tournament that's in town. There's jousting, melee duels, archery contests,
all kinds of things that are just fun to play around doing. The earliest sports,
if you will. Anyway the whole game is about talking to the other people there -
basically the games are "playing in the background", and while you can compete
in them it's not the bulk of the game. Most of it is just having a conversation
with an AI and acting it out *like a roleplaying game*. O M G teach people to
roleplay the way you play games! You're always going on about how "different"
your way of gaming is than other people. So *show us* how you do it, how do you
play? Like what are the fundamental, actual, steps that you take? You can show
us by programming a game that inspires that playstyle. That's what game design
is all about, finding creative ways to think. Well, think and act. But still.

anyway, so you know what you're about? Good. Let's go.
