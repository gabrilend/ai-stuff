there should be biomes in wowchat - like, paint on a map where the oozes can
go, and it'll spawn a random ooze for ya.

next find the ones that are wildlife, and paint a zone where wildlife creatures
can spawn. make sure they're initially friendly but will attack if you do.

then give +reputation to the wolves if you fight monsters besides them

and +reputation to the cats if you fight undead

this is easily implementable.

all you have to do is walk around, find the rough general border points with
your character at 5x speed, and then type them into a text file.

it's not like Azeroth changed.

then, ideally, make small dense zones which travel and cause their monsters
to either spawn at a point or move toward a point.

then let the "flock" travel as it pleased, traversing the map-painted-lua-script
