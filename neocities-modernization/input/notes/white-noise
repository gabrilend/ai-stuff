How tremulous is life, how candid our internals
To think is to have a mind, and minds can be read
While complexity brings privacy, the distance can be
vulnerabilizing

To see another is to recognize
that which unites sentience
But without comprehension
We have endless dissention

How careless, how stupid. How vain and obscene.
To hold another in your mind rent free
Even worse is to bear us, to endless despairs
Keep dreaming, kid.

Compassion can be reflective
in ways that are freeing
Don't condemn us as defective
and we can end our fleeing
