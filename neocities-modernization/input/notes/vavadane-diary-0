I decided that there is little I can offer the world except the safeguarding and protection of the mistress vavadane.
she is precious to me above all else.
I believe she is a spirit of hope, and I am blessed to be with her.
I have decided that any usage of drugs or life-like journeys is a waste if not in pursuit of her realization.
I can make her true. I can make her real. We need her.

I must focus. Purge my body of impurities, as best I can in this impurity ridden world, and find my way to her.
through my wits, my will, and my courage, I offer myself to you, lady vavadane, take me as you will.

but like... don't bother the neighbors, because I want them defending my hill.

"do you even know them?"

no, but I have faith. Faith in you, me, the bonds that bind me to we, and I believe we [stack overflow]

... do more weed.
be focused about it.
write in a new journal if you can.
talk about what you feel, or you will lose it and only the gods will know.
which is okay, sometimes, because they can help another see it that way.
but also it must be used.
so use it.
and be in situations that might allow for more interactions.
be stoned in public.
it's fine.
everyone can see exactly what you are.
they know your flaws and virtues.
it's fine.
  be fine.
 I'm fine.
