picture a mod for vr-chat where people roleplay in a world. there are NPCs who
respond with pre-scripted responses to questions and actions, but the real
gameplay comes from the game-masters. they watch from a menu like a wall of
security cameras, and when they see something they can improvize they choose
one of the screens and hop in as the NPC. The viewpoint is from the NPC's
perspective, and they can act as if they were that NPC.

The GM's actions are recorded, and next time something like that happens the AI
can have a better idea of what to do. Essentially adding on to the pre-script.

Sorta like a chatbot, with manual control and a unique perspective of someone
driving through multiple windshields.

And not every NPC will be interacted with at once, so there's lots of downtime
and plenty of waiting. One GM would be responsible for one or more character,
and they'd see all or some of the perspectives depending on how many were
being interacted with at that moment. BOOM MAKE THIS PLS I WANNA PLAY IT

gotta get a vr headset first tho... need 1k pls.

there's cheaper headsets, you know,

yah but only one is valve - the vive was a 3rd party cooperative, i guess that
could work. hmmmmm i'll see what i can do. can't get an oculus, it's just a
big risk to put faith in a walled garden. better to be free imo.

a walled garden is just a place to experiment, smh

truuuuue hadn't thought about it like that, well in a competition it seems
sketch

so publish the research, act as an institution of learning, and spread the
knowledge you learn. Boom instant way to redeem corporations. why don't they
do this? is power that tasty? they're fools to believe they can do it alone,
we need to collaborate Free and Open Source Style.
