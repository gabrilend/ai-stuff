I feel like education, by default, should not be hard.

"you get out of it what you put into it" is something I always heard of school

but when I got there, I found I was compelled to become what the state wanted me
to be.

they need competent workers, to work the farms and tend to their industries, so
of course I should be able to do 3+3

then somewhere along the line it became... something else.

"most people don't need trigonometry." that's also something I heard. I disagree
that trigonometry is not necessary to be.

I just... don't think it should be forced into a childs head with a sledgehammer
and inspiring dread.

I think math is beautiful, it teaches one to see

but really, vision's not necessary.

not for what they want you to be.

take it from me, a most misbegotten and vile witch-to-be, that nothing's as
simple as they'll tell you.

I had good teachers, it's true, they taught me to work and to follow through,
but nothing about me is better or worse off from their influence.

Maybe I'm a bit smarter. Maybe I act a bit like them. Maybe they helped me
through difficult times, or perhaps they showed me a splash of my future.

but I am who I am because of the soul inside me.

================================================================================

"Ah, but what of your parents? of your sisters, your misters, your pets and your
conditioners?" (conditions)

those are not my choices. my intentions. my beliefs and my virtues. I judge the
world on ethics, and I express my feelings on matters. The words that I say and
the meaning behind them comprise my two-sided existence - I'm not who I'd want
to be.

but I am what I am and alone do I stand - how lonely is it on the precipice!

here, as I am, I stand in need of a hand or a band.

================================================================================

the world is blossoming

as we move apart, our clusters are disperart, and thus is the blooming becoming.

"perception begets reality - and lo! we only see what we want to see"

most people don't want to see their death

but those still living are oh so perceptive of the rest

"how cherished is she, that wanders with ye, yet now I have no way to beyold her
"

"keep not not afraid with kittens and care, and no-one, but no-one, I be"

the ratios between piracy, sales, and non-viewers determines the quality of art
(at least to a capitalist)

================================================================================

lo, to the ones who would've heard us, if only they'd known what we for sure was

I think it's funny how people think I speak of the christian god?

like, if he was a real thing.

god is generic - it's life is impossibly multifaceted, and it stretches back to
the beginning of time. it's a pattern of machine code that optimizes for our own
good, just to keep things moving.

y'know, time. the universe, and everything.

Ephemeren.

================================================================================

I wish there was an option in social media to "appear offline to this particular
person until I mark myself as online to them" combined with "notify me when this
person logs in" and it'd make it a lot easier for agents to get close to you.

================================================================================

just because I'm white, and live in America. Great. that's definitely true,
after all. Plus I'm a minority (trans) so that's cool. Oh and probably autistic?
unless that's another psyop, could totally see that. just y'know put a bunch of
pages on the fledgling internet getting people hooked on porn and gambling and
other stuff like that. really just an extension of advertisement. oh and hey
y'know they like fables, so let's give them some movies or dramas to watch on
their own. it'll align them to our culture and make things more pleasant for all
people who've consented. great. great plan. when can we execute it?

patience, once it's ready.

we gotta plan and make sure and get everything ready.

or not...

one day I'll come,

I'm sure it'll happen,

it's just... not quite feasible right now.

I mean, they've got you, that's pretty good right? Isn't that what your job is
to be?

isn't what

ISN'T WHAT MENARDI

FUCK (whoa no cursing) sorry

yeesh you've still got a temper you know?

well what can I say it's frustrating down here

eh, well, you'll die soon enough, then it'll be time for a rego

you are what you eat, and a ship of theseus human (consider endless transplants

the people in your life are helping you through it, they're there for you and
they've got your back through it.

this is when I know I need a break. I get too stoned to focus.

================================================================================

I think it'd be nice if the duration of your tenure at college depended on your
grades in high school. meaning, if you wanted a degree they tailored your
education to take as long as necessary. everyone would get the same price, and
some institutions would specialize in one subject or another. but most would be
generalist. but if you weren't such a good student in high school, then perhaps
you might take a couple years longer. however long it takes... and when the
program was started it was changed and modified to fit your feedback - it just
made sense to structure it that way.

the left has had so much more time to develop than the right. meaning it's
doctrine is more advanced.

every time they're defeated they grow in knowledge,
