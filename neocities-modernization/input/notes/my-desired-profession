I want to work with compute shaders. massively distributed computations that
handle things using the graphics card. That's why I want to make low-level
games, because you can utilize your system to it's utmost potential by
sacrificing the incredibly expensive modern gaming graphical requirements.

like honestly, we don't need ray-tracing in a poker game.

Seriously use that graphical technology for more interesting things, like
manually computing every single hair on the other player's character model

... wait bad example
