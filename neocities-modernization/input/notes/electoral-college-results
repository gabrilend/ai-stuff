fucking bastards

colorado defends from the mountains

the military faces theft of equipment which is used en-masse to disrupt combat convoys while command struggles to hold everything clear

aviation experts fly bomb-laden civilian aircraft into convoys

drones and landmined highways abound

volunteers from canada turned away at the border

except in vancouver

portland unites with seattle

montana is an unexpected ally

moments of calm as the right sizes up their foes while democrats march on
