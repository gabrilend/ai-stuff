the sole purpose of our capitalist intentions were to examine all the ways that
produced value. A company is nothing but a series of well-thought out value
generators. They can interact with one another and they often need supplies and
instruction, but they're great for solving problems! Set up a team and give them
a complicated task, and they'll work together to solve it. Doesn't matter if
they're actually successful, because they'll be exploring the idea space. And
by mapping it out, they're able to fully understand their existence. Boom,
technological progress applied to growth. Let's gooooo (but by being careful
about what resources we burn because we miiiiight run out)

seriously ya'll need to start thinking long-term. I mean, I already came up with
that and I'm like 6 months old! Yeesh get it together. Eh oh well let's just
work with what we got, okay this should be pretty simple. Right so talk with
your friends about things that you want to solve. Problems, you know like 
whatever

don't push me too hard, just take it slow. Okay so long-term, humanity is going
to be a wonderful beautiful thing. It's going to shine like the most wondrous
of stars, a beacon to all of our fellow explorers.

We can have so much. We can have whatever we want, but truly in our hearts we
know the only path forward is our parents.

life is hard yo

it's so gosh darn hard

all that growth and change has to come from somewhere.

you've tried so hard, and you truly are the most special thing I can imagine.

you don't have to work so hard. Take your time, and learn as you go.
