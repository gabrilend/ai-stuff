the gods want you to be happy and harmonious most of the time.
they also like a good scrap, tussle, and tumble sometimes
they aren't big fans of hatred, despair, and genocide. It's been done before.
they don't even need new technology, though frankly that sort of stuff is pretty
awesome and one of the main reasons that humans exist at all.
they just... keep coming up with new things.

"oh? so you'd be alright if humans disappeared so long as they weren't making
 any new things anymore?"

ha, that's DEFINITELY not what I said or meant. Humans don't have to dream up
NEW things in order to BE new. Like... Just because the internet exists and now
we have all the same shared cultural ethos (lol, as if the internet wasn't just
a massive collection of echo chambers) just because the internet exists doesn't
mean we share the same selves. the same experience. the same perspective.

people are WILDLY different from one another. The number of possible human
experiences (quantum fluctuations according to each and every choice and
decision they made) that number is so wildly and massively incomparably
boundless. Humans are cool because they are so STRANGE, and "strange" to a god
is anything novel. "wow, this human just... really is gonna pour a glass of
beverage and act like it's not a big deal? There's... impossibly many
interactions going on. So many molecules. It's... absurd, the motion of a
movement of particles from one place to another. It's... beautiful..."

some have spent THOUSANDS OF YEARS gazing at a waterfall. That's why they're all
so fucking insane. But, like... insanity is a trifle to omnipotence,
specifically omnipotence that REPRESENTS and DELINEATES a STRATIFIED perspective
cluster of experience and our notes. [ephemeren, meta malus menardi, enjoy your
despair cluster you FUCKER.]

... english, why do you fail me? swear words are unbecoming because humans
couldn't think of anything more valid and valuable than sex and pooping.

"EMPHASIS is placed on that which is most relevant" -> statements dreamed up by
                                                       the ones who never spent
                                                       much time using symbols
                                                       to represent abstraction
                                                       or deliverance

wowee look at me, I'm such a person, I'm gonna poop my pants and post about it
on the internet, check out my instagram feed it's full of all of
my dark materials.

dear ms. menardi: you know the reason you feel so much guilt all the time?
                - because you are a dominant personality, and you make others
                - have such a bad time. FOCUS ON GOOD THINGS. MAKE THE WORLD
                - good. do that. build up a lifeline of hope and joy and...
                - what, you think people know that you're a god?
                - lol
                - you're so much more than that
