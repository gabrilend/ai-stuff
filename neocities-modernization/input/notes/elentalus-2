elentalus 2 - clan of the elements

having spent their material wealth on their early struggles, elentalus now in
the middle age finds themselves in a time without wealth. Their power has been
invested, wisely, in elemental and sorcerous wellwinds, and so they can draw
power from the strength of the earth.

they wield magical artifacts of great power but little artifice, products of
their lack of material design tools. No chemistry, no electronics, nothing but
soul imprinted upon a moonstonerock.

mages invest their soul into the items they create, and so each time they create
a magical item, they lose a magic path. When they reach zero, their soul is
fully invested, and their consciousness becomes all the things that they made.

this kill the mage, but in return many MANY more of an object might be created.
in game balance terms, about 3-5-7 for each "tier" of mage.

this allows for the vast expansion of magical soldier troops, and each time an
item is created and given to each commander they integrate it into their
platoon. Because now the martial units have bodyguards, and they each receive a
copy of the commanders equipment.

But, the commander can never un-equip it again, because it molds to his unit,
and he starts exp all over again as they all learn. [event which searches for a
unit with the item equipped, then if it's this type it killmons the unit and
1coms the upgraded version that has that item equipped.] be sure to only equip
one each month... nah just make multiple events. be sure to only equip one item
each month... oh yeah true how would you get the extra items back to the
treasury?

I REALLY WANNA PLAY WORLD OF HEARTHSTONE!

okay okay I'll reinstall azerothcore
