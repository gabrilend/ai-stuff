is it not strange that attention acretes dimensions? all focus is a connection,
between logic and our seeing. you see it in your eye, when it's impossible to
lie, and truth is a weapon of murder. the media is fine, to weather our times,
and they'll guide us into our slaughter.

what an incredible find! this perilous thine? 

go watch the mummy
