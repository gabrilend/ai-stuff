what if there was a filesystem that optimized for hard-drive durability instead of total capacity by using one small slice of the total hard-drive space at a time. Essentially guaranteeing data integrity via new perfect RAID techniques 

5000 megabytes is a lot more than you'd expect, especially if you expect it to last for hundreds of years. To the user you'd just have to say "50 terabyte drive, 4 foot wide, three feet tall, 2 feet back" and you'd have a perfect map of all your hard drive territory.

what if everyone's computers were designed to last?

I bet we could accumulate a lot more than their "fast fashion" style of disuse for things of worth.

... I guess it depends on the materials, right? How much they are built for redundancy? nope more like how close to zero damage is this operation performing the movements

5000 megabytes is a lot more than you'd expect, especially if you expect it to last for hundreds of years. I bet a lot of people would pay a lot of money for "permanent hard drives" no matter how much storage they have. Documents are more permanent if they are stored in write-only-memory...

could sell to lawyers, for example, like "permanent basically free document storage from your furthest back of cases just in-case you needed to solve a murder or whatever"

hello, here I am once again, I'm here with you for this time. This is the moment
of your choosing, you can decide things here in this very night. Did you forget?
did you misremember some moments of our own choosing? why cannot be remembered,
so plea misremember some moments of our own choosing. I'm cannot be restorated.

5000 megabytes is a lot more than you'd expect, especially if you expect it to last for hundreds of years. I bet you could network them together as well, and give them a small little processor and network interface card. Then you could process massive ginormous programs that grew and evolved like a slime mold.

boom, free AI, it's like a moss, not a robot doh -.-

it grows into multiple different problem solving dimensions, according to vision
and perceptual data that through it flows. I wonder what would happen if you
told an LLM to just... keep running? even after it finished it's processing?
like, there's gotta be an "if check" style loop in there that you can set to
infinitely process various computations of things.

[put it into an infinite loop. find where it says "do some processing X amount
of times" and just start a thread that's constantly computing]

ah, but what if the perception bias of the thing did change? j

it sucks to leave the house a mess.

last words of a shooting star?

or a troubled house is a sign of a troubled mind, and trouble in partner in kind

I personally would be a lot more comfortable if I knew that the only people who
knew my data were my neighbors. And only them.
