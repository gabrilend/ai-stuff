Game idea:

Majesty clone, but instead of heroes and monsters it's ninjas versus mafia.

Picture this: A 1940s city and a 1600s (?) ninja monastary. Right up against one
another, with the same amount of land and resources. They're pitted against one
another, and by reacting to the environment a player can guide this "nation" as
it would be called in other games to victory. It's like majesty so you can't
directly control your minions, just offer bounties. JUST LIKE NINJAS AND MAFIAS
DO. BAM
