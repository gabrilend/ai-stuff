there's a part of me that believes magic is real. other parts that are 
convinced. I am a witch, you see, and while I can't quite control fire or 
bullets I can do other neat things. if you'd let me, humanity.

I'm not doing an ARG, not intentionally. I pretty much post things I conceive 
of, like a conduit passed through spacetime. wild how mind bending the future
can be. will be interesting to see what kinds of things there is in store for 
people you and me.

those websites you posted... they're beautiful - I learned things, your method
of expression was too [the words "confess" are heard loudly, super weird] I 
especially liked the oven that tries to lure you into a secret third place. not
the mind, nor the body, but someplace besides.

also the graphs and figures were news to me, I mean how could those numbers ever
come to be? but alas that's the truth, that we orbit our proof, and alas that 
our meanings are lacking.
