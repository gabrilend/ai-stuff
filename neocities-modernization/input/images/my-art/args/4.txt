visual representation of the conversation I saw and responded to. I think you 
two are the coolest! heart emojis, flashing passionate excitement brought on by
a feeling like you'd get when fangirling over something except like, more low
key because I'm in control of my emotions or whatever. gonna put this in a 
direct message though since it somehow feels... personal? sorry. you can block
me if you don't like me. I promise I don't mind. I want to send it to the other
person too hope that's cool with you. Just because it was your two conversation
and I'm just dropping in because I'm always butting in to public things on the
internet. Guess that's just something I picked up on Reddit, where you're 
encouraged to contribute to the conversation. Though I wish it was easier to 
view threads on Mastodon, sometimes it feels like it's easy to lose the track of
where you were going when the structure of the medium diverts your attention 
elsewhere. alas, I am not a designer, just a complainer and a whiner I guess. 
I'm sleepy. sorry to bother you.
