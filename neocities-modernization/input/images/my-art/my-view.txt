originally created may 28th 2022. The date has to be changed because it was
moved, and linux considers moving a file to be the same thing as changing it.

which I get, I guess, but really I'm concerned with the contents of the view.

anyway, it was originally filed in: ~/pictures/my view.png, however there was
a space in the name suggesting it was written hastily or in some state of
inebriation. in addition, it was found in the wrong folder, when it should have
been filed under: ~/pictures/my-art/my-view.png. This would have prevented the
renaming operation, and thus preserved the authenticity of the file as it was
created.

this kind of documentation is important for my religion, so I practice it when
I can.
