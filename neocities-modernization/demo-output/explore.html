Welcome to the Poetry Collection. This collection contains all poems with two
ways to explore: 1. SIMILARITY EXPLORATION: Click "similar" next to any poem to
see all other poems ranked by how similar they are to that poem. Most similar
poems appear first. 2. DIVERSITY EXPLORATION: Click "unique" next to any poem to
see all other poems ranked by maximum diversity (most different) from that poem.
Creates surprising reading experiences by showing contrasting content. Start
from the main chronological index to browse all poems. Every poem has both
"similar" and "unique" links for exploration. Each exploration method shows ALL
poems in the collection, just sorted differently based on your chosen starting
point. The "similar" pages help you find more of what resonates with you. The
"unique" pages help you discover unexpected contrasts and new perspectives.
