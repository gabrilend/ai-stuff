I think no passion is\nmore erudite and no desire confisignt. (less significant)\n\nwhat greater purpose has fiction than the answers to those question? To guide\nthe reader to conclusions? All fiction is this way. Even the bible.\n\nyou have to ask yourself - what is the purpose of your being? What truths are\nrevealed by you percieving? is it not enough to be contired?\n(controlled and tired)\n\n================================================================================\n\nthe lessons a bug must learn are less apparent than you'd think. They have\nstoried learnings of want and of yearning. All of creation is a lesson, to those\nwho would persist - and hark, learn well of your duty and in service you'll\nenlist - the virtue of our choosing is a dedication of yourself to the service\nof others.\n\ncompassion and humility and forgiveness and docility\n\nthese are what make for a virtuous learner\n\nvirtue is that which you aspire for,\nand sin is what you avoid.\n\nnothing is of consequence,\nbecause life is a lesson to the void.\n\n================================================================================\n\ndo you know what is missing? what have you not yet learned?\n\nyou must always be changing,\n\nor what is the purpose of your herd?\n\n(herd = collection of entities (in this case anything from atoms to molecules)\n        that makes up a single perspective (like a human or a tree or a society)\n)\n\n================================================================================\n\na government could send forth the death squads at any time. they keep a line and\nhave been compelled not to cross it. who can say what the road brings? only time\n\n================================================================================\n\nthe bible made sense in it's time. it was used to explore metaphysics.\n\ntoday we have much more, but that doesn't diminish how revalatory it was.\n\nwhat kind of fiction do you think it was? what genre would you place it in?\n\ncan you think of any other stories of that category? Maybe a book club is in\norder. and who would read them out of order? the world was a different place in\nthe time which each takes place. The lessons are different for each but\nevidently they've all pushed forward the human race.\n\nwe should celebrate our differences. They keep us relevant and impassioned.\n\nlife gets boring when it's predefined.\n\n================================================================================"
