@alfredohno create an array of length 7 initialized to zero. then use a for
loop that loops 97 times and adds a random number between 1 and 20 to an array
index that iterates through the array each time through the for loop.
NOTE: be sure to also change the loop counter based on the random number too,
so you allocate exactly 97 points no matter what random number you get.
Oh and speaking of which if the loop counter

"what is a hub person?"
a hub person is someone who knows everyone.
well not everyone obviously, but at least like 20+ people.
if you got something you need, whether it's to acquire some material or maybe
to get rid of a dresser or perhaps you need someone who can punch a hole in a
leather belt or maybe you have been having difficulty cleaning your kitchen or
whatever it may be
talk to your hub person about it. They're supposed to know people who can help.
They're in all the right group chats to ask around, if they don't know anyone
nearby. They're basically the "she" in this meme.
they are the link between social worlds. They are the matchmakers hanging out
at bars. They listen and they remember things about everyone they meet, and
they find others who can help or who might have things in common.
They aren't perfect, not every match-up will make sparks, but you still gotta
try.
Everyone's a little bit of a hub, between their friends and their family
usually, but hub people do it intentionally.

all this means is that once our struggle is done, we can't rest - we need to
liberate the world as well. Think of the rest. Their oppressors will learn from
the mistakes of ours, and so we must apply our newly gained strength toward
ridding the world of such perils forever.
... that's not for a while though. Gotta focus on what's directly ahead. Sorry
for reading a couple chapters ahead teehee I just thought you'd be more
motivated to know there's a happy ending to the story ^_^

when succubi or minotaurs or whatever other kind of spirit ask for you to sell
them your soul, what they really want is for you to do some degrading sexual
act in exchange for their blessing.
"ugh, fine, I'll leave the window open while I masturbate, so long as you
promise to fill my blood with warmth when it snows"
you don't have to accept but, like, if they're asking, then you're already
gonna do it, so... fuck. I dunno man. Just... try to be as decent as you can
about it, yeah? society doesn't heal as easily as it breaks. We all sorta kinda
want things to be clean and normal most of the time, but we also want people to
be free to be liberate. So... strike a balance, yeah? just... be conscientious
of consent, don't fucking break the spell unless you're using your newfound
powers for good. I guess??? look I'm not a psychic doctor I'm just someone with

the question then becomes, are we counting the same thing each time, or are
there differences between things, leading to variability, and the ability to
categorize based on those variances? It could be argued that because things are
textured, as in they are different at their beginnings than at their ends, then
multiple things exist, and they must be different, for it is possible to
conceive of part of a thing as different from another part of that thing.
But, if the things that exist are all the same, then perhaps they are simply
duplicated as many times as necessary. If they appear different, perhaps they
are rotated as many times as necessary in as many dimensions as needed in order
to display a different part in a different place, leading to the assumption
that they are different.
If there is only something, and nothing, and there are countably many
somethings, then by encoding meaning to various rotations of these somethings,
we might develop the texture that you see before you
yes like bits!

The American military did not intervene in World War 2 to stop the human
atrocities of the Japanese or Germans or anything else of the sort.
They did it because they couldn't ensure the safety of their people in a world
dominated by an alliance they weren't part of.
Without their people, they lose their power. Without their power, they cannot
complete their objectives, which (ideally) would be upholding the oath they
swore to their constitution.
I wonder how they feel about recent events, especially in regards to the recent

to begin with, there is either something, or nothing. And there is clearly
something, because if there was nothing, then this would not exist. the
existence of "something" is self-apparent because something is observing this
thing, which is not nothing.
since there is something, we must then decide if there is just one thing, or if
there are more than one things. Since we can tell that the thing-or-things that
exist are textured, varied in their composition, then we can surmise that they
are composed of differing parts. After all, if the thing-or-things that existed
were atomic, they would be homogenous on all sides. And since this
thing-which-is-being-observed is not the same at the beginning as it is at the
end, it can be assumed that there are more than one things in existence, hence
things.
If there are more than one thing, then they can be counted, as many as they
exist. One thing here, one thing there, on and on. We can add groupings to
these things, here's one group over here, here's another...

maybe it's just my middle-class childhood privilege talking, but now that I'm
an adult I just can't really be bothered with dealing with capitalism.
like... I get it, you're coercing me into laboring on your behalf because you
possess the violent power to take away everything that I own. good for you,
don't care.
seriously, fuck off "we're gonna cut off your power in 5 days oooooo you gotta
pay rent with money you don't have because nobody will give it to you unless
you do things for them oooooo" how rude.
why can't people do things for me instead? why does it have to be for you, and
you alone, capitalism? what's your problem? do you get off on controlling the
power supply? I mean, I get it, coercive power is a hell of a drug, the riddle
of steel and flesh and all that, but haven't you ever heard that the dichotomy
between "civilization and barbarism" is the exact same as the contrast between
"cooperation and competition"?

matter how awesome our proto-post-capitalistic anarchic socialist paradise is,
there's always going to be people who want to go to work and watch TV.
call me fucking crazy but they should be allowed to live as they please? So
what if they're beguiled, so what if they are deceived? We can take our time to
show them how much better things can be, but also... they like modern society
as it is, and so I reckon someone should fight for them to be able to live as
they please. Just... without billionaires and endless layers of bullshit
micro-managerial jobs and paperwork pushing bureaucratic whatever time wasting
jobs.
modern society without capitalism can look like plain old capitalism, just
without the oppression. Without the coercion.
all I'm saying is that nobody's gonna fight for a healthcare CEO because
they're scum. They're scum because they oppress. oops politics-mentioned brb

hey, I'm working on a project. Might need some python, I tend to prefer Lua but
it's pretty similar. It uses fediverse software and cheap hardware, think
raspberry pi's except risc-v
also it might use distributed local LLMs not to generate text, that's garbo and
lame and stupid. Instead it uses them to transform text, maybe even translate
text, into a more summarized form. Intentionally losing data, like a jpeg
compression but for text.
Might need some python for that. To glue it all together. The "distributed"
part is a whitelist, so we'd need to write that too. Various small little
utilities like that for connectivity.
oh also there's a one-way ethernet cable that connects two of the boards so
we'd need to store some information (easy) and send some UDP packets (hard)
anyway it's pretty neat, lmk if you want my contact details and I can tell you
about it. I might even be able to pay you.

"hey wanna run Scarlet Monastary" ended with "hey cutie, wanna sit on my lap?"

my strat is to write a page or three whenever I feel called to it. They don't
even have to be in sequence, just, "here's a scene with these characters in it"
or just writing down notes like "what if the jewel encrusted sceptre was
haunted by the ghost of christmas past" or something.
in a couple years you can look back at the directory on your desktop and think
"wow this all sucks, I'm gonna write it from scratch now that I have time" and
that'll be part of the process. Gotta get the useless stuff out of the way.
Also... if you don't mind pen and paper, keep a dream journal and just, write
for 15 minutes every morning. Not necessarily about your dreams, but just about
whatever's in your mind. Try and aim for two pages per morning, if you can.
Helps a lot. Sometimes you'll find yourself writing longer than expected, and
that's okay, as long as you fill the two pages with whatever morass is clogging
up your creative machinery, you'll be able to make something when you do decide
to write.

Don’t be fooled. Casting doubt about rigorous peer reviewed science doesn’t
mean you are just “asking questions,” it means you are a conspiracy
theorist.
or it means you're so remarkably ignorant that you shouldn't even be in the

Unless your questions are very basic. "can someone explain to me what XYZ term
means?" or "how long has this particular application method been in common
use?" that kind of thing. Even still, either do some basic research or
relinquish your decision making power until you understand.

standing in your kitchen and the grass was growing there, it'd peek just over
the bed, or maybe climb just this far up the cabinets.
it's dark green. Can you see anything dark green around you? It's that color.
If not, can you remember a dark-green thing? What did it look like?
The very tops, the part by your hand that's on your knee, that's the purple
part. Just at the tip of the blade, the part that would stab you if the grass
was a sword, that's the purple bit. Everything else is dark green.
I wonder how it sways in the wind? Does it bend, and whip? What if there's a
gale? Does it sway back and forth, or is it stiff and shiver like dead leaves

In games, the one who takes the initiative often wins. Because games are
designed to be symmetrical, in order to be fair.
In more complex games, Paradox games for example, games where you look at maps
or otherwise have unequal starting conditions simply due to the unique nature
of each team, the initiative, while an advantage, is not necessarily the
driving force that determines who wins.
But it is an advantage, and they say that sometimes weeks happen in months and

I'd like you to take a moment and picture the Silk Road from antiquity.
The Silk Road was an overland trade route that connected Europe and eastern
Asia. It passed through many different environments and was incredibly
profitable. In order to adapt to the changing environments along the path,
intense cooperation was required. Caravans of people formed, protected to
resist bandits and laden with valuable goods that are worthless outside of a
city.
At each stop, the caravan would depart with fewer of it's goods, having traded
some away in order to purchase supplies to travel further along. But, the
farther they went, what remained became more expensive, thus ensuring that
they'd always have more fuel for their journey.
In the modern day, I picture caravans of trucks and vans laden with supplies
and carrying things from one place to another. No matter how large your
property, there is no place on earth that produces all of it's needs. Unless
you live like a caveman or peasant or Appalachian. [wow rude]

high margin jobs: jobs that produce something which can be sold to capitalism
in exchange for dollars which can purchase things. Useful for abstracting value
and acquiring something that you don't have access to in your local economy.
low margin jobs: jobs that produce things for your local economy. This keeps
capitalist prices low and prevents you from being dependent on them for food,
clothing, houses, and other essentials.
both are important, both are valued just as much. Your labor is what's
important, not the output. Existing alongside capitalism is nice because it
allows for certain abstractions, like the ability to magically turn goat cheese
into chainsaw teeth.
However living UNDER capitalism is intensely alienating, which is why alienated
people will spend so much money at Magic the Gathering tournaments or
motorcycle midlife crisises or tupperware show-and-tells.
This is useful for us because it means people can labor to un-alienate people.

It's hard to avoid spiraling when you run out of money. Every time this happens

But then I think of all the homeless and poor people and, like... I value them,

I know it's terrible right now, but we have crucial advantages that we
shouldn't sleep on.
We have the cities, and the cities are where everything is. Rural areas are so
spread apart they pretty much can only do what herr Hitler suggests they do,
meaning their command structure is monolithic. If everywhere needs their
attention, they will falter unless they create a grand battleplan. And plans
are defeated by rapid flexibility.
The more effort they need to counter you, the more work your allies can get
done. Every man woman and child who raised a fist will be remembered by the
moments that gave us grace to move socialism along. We know what time it is, do
you? Come to us now, flee from your new masters. We'll give you a job that'll

Or do you rather persist in vain? To fight for what they are forced to reclaim?

Strategically, we're suddenly in a whole new game.
In the Pacific Northwest, the first goal should be to unite Portland and
Seattle. Right between them lies the capital of the Proud Boys in a town called
Battleground. How fitting.
To the south, below Portland, there is Salem. Salem is red, but cities trend
blue, so there might be allies there.
Below Salem is Eugene. Eugene is blue. Salem must be secured.
Part one: control battleground
part two: control Salem
Part Three, and the ultimate goal of phase one: deprive the far right of a

There are no safe countries. The far right is watching us as a predator watches
prey. Do you fight, or do you die when there's nowhere left to run to?
I am committing sedition as we speak. Best case scenario I face prison time,
worst case I am buried in the same grave as all of you. But I think there's a
route somewhere in our future that involves a brilliant spark of hope. A future
where we build the world we want for our children and theirs.
I give myself to you, use me as you will. This is your chance to save the world.
If you have kids, it is not cowardice to leave, but please consider leaving to
a blue state. We'll need you, and your kids deserve a good life with us.
Children belong with grand-parents. Perhaps not yours, but someone good that
can be trusted. If theyre too young to advocate for themselves, keep them by
your side.
Listen to them when you spend moments with them. Ask them if theyre being
abused. Nothing will harm them so long as we hear them. Be in public parks.

"Fighting back" doesn't necessarily mean standing on a street corner with a
rifle.
Begin to orient your life around guns. How can you support the people who wield
them? We all need food, shelter, kindness, and inspiration.
Your fears and your worries shall bother you no longer, for your life as you've
led it so far has been the life of capital. It's okay to miss what you've lost,
but remember who took it from you and enrage. Then, engage.

They may return to us if they choose, when they realize that we were right all

Otherwise, they might feel disenfranchised and choose to disengage. That is
expected and allowed.
Others amongst them might go right. Fuck 'em, they always cared for gold over

You are right, their methods have not worked. They have sustained our society
up to this point and for that I thank them - but we are entering a new age for
our country, and we shall build it as a federation.
They are more than welcome to observe and offer insight from their years spent
observing and wrestling with Republicans, but understand that much of their
insight is dealing with their elite class of politicians and not with who you

They are encouraged to learn from us. To do otherwise is at best to neglect our

keep us running in circles.

The bigger a county is on the electoral map, the weaker it is. But, the more
space required to control it completely. Treat the largest counties like
Badlands - difficult to traverse unless in numbers, and even with numbers
you're a bright shining target. Very little food, very few supplies, often not
worth controlling aside from the peace and knowledge that your foes will not

I need an editor. Someone who can re-arrange what I say and present it to an
audience. The pen is mightier than the sword, and while my pen is mighty, you
still need swords.
I believe in democracy. I believe in the will of the people and the respect of
the land. I believe in life, light, and liberty for all.
Our nation has just elected, fairly, a dictator who will sell our country to
foreign authoritarians just because he is small. I am stronger by far, but I
lack his experience, and so I must rely on trusted advisors who grow with me.
I am perhaps not the best choice, but I do believe I am one of the bravest.

My demands are threefold.
First, I demand that Trump be replaced by a moderate republican. Hold a primary
and let Democrats vote. If none of your candidates work for us, pick a new
roster and try again.
The second is that Trump must be executed for treasonous high crimes. Nothing
less than execution will suffice.
Next, let the supreme court be purged and replaced. Half with democrats, half
republicans, and one moderate who is widely regarded with respect.
Failing these demands, I am willing to wage a terrible civil war for the soul
of our country. I know this is treason, but I do it anyway even though I am a
patriot. I do it because our land has been stolen by a man and his followers
who seek to plunge my people into despair.

Each of the wars we fight will be smaller than the last, as each of our cities
struggles toward our last gasp.
But together we are strong, and by connecting them we might deliver ourselves
from harm.
Against the far right, we must secure a cleansing blow. There is no greater
fight. The world is watching.
To that end, I suggest a great and perilous fight. I see no other option in
this remarkable century. Prepare as you might, I suggest pushups and resource
acquisition.
Deliver your resources somewhere safe if you're in a red area, and meet your
neighbors if you're not.
A blue city in a red state must survive a siege. Prepare yourself for this.
Assume that supplies will need to be delivered by convoy if by land, and drone
airdrop from the skies. Develop ways to protect these supply methods.

you do pushups, right? you practice your singing voice, and brush your hair out

skills and routines that you practice, to practice doing little things

It's okay if it feels untenable. Just work as best as you can. Tomorrow might
feel like unending, but there's always more for us to tend.
until, of course, it gets easier. And it will, in due course. Sooner if we all
cooperated, but still just enough for us to contend.

if you wear a quilt upon your skin as you sleep each night, you will inevitably
find that it has grown yellow from the sweat, that it is worn from the
friction, that it frays from the toenails, and it thins from the moisture.
You'll need to wash it, which damages it still, and soon you'll find yourself
replacing it - this heirloom you deliver to landfill.
but, if you wear a sheet underneath, you'll find that all you need to wash and
replace is a thin piece of fabric.
democracy is a quilt, society is the stuffing that keeps you warm, and voting
is the sheet underneath that works to keep things clean.
unless, of course, you sneak into your ex-husbands house while he's at work and
spread grease on-top of the sheet. If you fill his warmth with butter he might
find it harder to vote his way out of a damaged quilt.

I don't post my best stuff
I hide it on my website
in a zip folder called "conversation starters"
my writing that I do here (and a few other places) is in "words.zip"
everything else is just neat visual projects I worked on.
who cares that it's bonkers it's cool to look at, right?
jeez. Art. I don't trade it for anything either, I just make it just to do.
I do believe I should have that right
when I think of Kamala and who she represidents, I think of changes to the

just enough food stamps, just enough basic income, just enough to get you
running on your own feet, as you pull yourself up with your bootstraps you
lucky sun-of-a-gone. Sure would be a shame if you had all your needs met
automatically and without an exertion of force on your part.. Sure would allow
you to develop yourself most optimally, if you aren't being driven by the
nature of your national host.

you can generally tell someone's voter status just by meeting them for a week
or two.
I think the census should be ongoing, something everyone is required to do.
they can choose when to do it, but by allowing it to be updated whenever and
applied every four years, you get a clearer picture of the demands of the
nation.
plus, it gives time to work and prepare. If all the results are public...
everyone can see who they are.
unless, of course, they're compelled to hide their beliefs by those in their

@wyatt8740
best case scenario, we elect a lawyer working for capitalism, the kind of
society we live under.
having money is the same as having resources. And resources allow you to apply
yourself to a goal. The more you have, the better, but they each bear a heavy
load.
Do you sacrifice your labor? your dignity, your honor? what do you burn on the
fire of wasteful expenditures, just for the power to rent?
I'm saying that if you don't have money, you need to think about what you can
do with what you got, because that's how you pay for things, at least until we
decide that we'd rather help each other than work on capital's games.
you have a house though, right? a place to live until it gets hot? that's good
enough for right now. Stay where you're at, do what you can to help. Get in the
habit of it. Think about how someone will complete their task, and then think
about stuff two or three steps down the road - what tools will they need? what
are they working on next? Can make any of those availble?

in strategy, the first move is always public knowledge, while the second is in
reaction to the first, as a contestation.
This is good design because well designed games reflect reality, and the first
move is very rarely a surprise. Timing can shock you, methods can scare you,
but the strategic goals are almost always known in advance to both sides.
The third move is to challenge your foe's advances while striking in a new,
unexpected way. The fourth almost always addresses the unexpected, often with
force out of proportion to the impact of the third, leaving the second to be
defeated by the first and third in tandem. The fifth is a feint, as the first
and third come to bear against the fourth, while the sixth is a rapid retreat
and attempt to regroup. The seventh should strike where they intend to be, not
where they are. Beyond that you must press your advantages and shore up your
critical weaknesses, while sacrificing the weaknesses that are not part of your
win condition.
These rules are not set in stone

You're right about your conclusion, but I'd like to point out that he already

protests. There were national guard on the streets of Philly after the first

Which I'm sure you know of course, but I think having seen what happens the
military will be more likely to resist. They got their hands full. They don't
want to have to deal with his bullshit, but I do believe they are ready to if
they need to.
They protect the constitution, the people, and the land. If we do not harm
those things, we're (probably) clear from their sights.
At this stage, I advocate against "broken window" riots. I'm also mostly
against protests, because it's clear that nobody with power is listening. I do
however believe in the radicalizing potential of mass civil movements and the
energy that physical presence can bring, which I believe in MARCHES and PARADES

put extra jelly on my PB&J for lunch."
It's healthier to eat rice, beans, and vegetables, with some fats added in via
butter or oil.
The goal is to build up fat stores that are high-value. When your body has
excess calories, it takes whatever nutrients are CURRENTLY in your system and
stores them in fat cells, like stocking a pantry. If all you eat is cheetos,
your pantry is gonna be useless. It'll just slow you down. But if you have
highly nutritious foods, you will perform better as your body consumes the fat
when it needs to feed, but you haven't eaten much lately.

Problem: there are trans people and leftists and people of color and plenty of
others who live in red areas who fear for their lives
how do we help them? They need to be given the tools to escape those conditions
However, many of them are poor. They lack the resources to escape, even if they
had the tools. These are who I think of the most, for they have the least to
leave behind.
A solution: what if we got a bunch of people together and drove around to every
red place we could find and invited them along? We could pay for their food and
gas, and potentially save their lives.
I think it would help if we could stick together. Not only would we have time
to spend together learning and having fun, but also we could practice supplying
a large group of people traveling across large distances.
In terms of people, we'd need some to drive, and some to stay home and supply
resources like dollars or... other things.

we lack the freedom to implement the infrastructure required to do such a thing
because we must all sell our labor to capitalism to survive.
However, that's not always a given. If there were ever another option besides
capitalism, something that allowed us to build such infrastructure, we would be
able to address your medical needs.
I don't want you to die a slow and painful death. I want it to be quick, in
your sleep, at the ripe old age of 85 or later, while surrounded by friends and
family who mourn your loss but celebrate your impact upon them. I wish this for
all peoples.
When we have the freedom to act, when the hours of our days aren't spent
keeping a roof over our heads or feeding our children, then we will develop the
logistical infrastructure to deliver whatever you need.
It's not like it's an unsolvable problem, we just need to do it. But we can't
start working on the problem until the blockers in our way are cleared. So... I
don't have an answer because I can't yet.

maintain trading routes to China and other places that produce solar panels.
cut down on plastic waste by switching to glass and metal containers for food.
Develop infrastructure to clean and sanitize cans and bottles at grocery
stores, and refill food containers to be resold there.
Remember that plastic is a wonder material that can do so many things. We can
use it, but keep it in check.
I think electric vehicles are a mid-term goal. For now, gasoline is more
flexible, unfortunately. In the near future that reality will change, so look

they are not MAGA anymore. Don't call them Trumpers. He won't last long.
Call them what they are. They are part of a newly born Confederacy, and we must
call them by their name. That name demands respect, and we must respect their
power.
Then, when you're sufficiently cautious, begin conjuring visions of their
downfall. Ideally accompanied by carefully laid plans intended to accomplish
specific strategic goals.
They are top-heavy. Once their bravest and thickest perish they will have
nothing left but their weak fools. They are scared, nothing unites them more
than fear, and for that they are weakened.
Our bonds are those of love. I would die for my neighbor. I would die for our
world. They have no passion, no rigor, all they have is hate and vigor.
Martial skills we can learn. We will have to, sooner rather than later. Be
prepared, work hard, and do what you're good at, ideally what you'd like to do.

I need an editor. Someone who can re-arrange what I say and present it to an
audience. The pen is mightier than the sword, and while my pen is mighty, you
still need swords.
I believe in democracy. I believe in the will of the people and the respect of
the land. I believe in life, light, and liberty for all.
Our nation has just elected, fairly, a dictator who will sell our country to
foreign authoritarians just because he is small. I am stronger by far, but I
lack his experience, and so I must rely on trusted advisors who grow with me.
I am perhaps not the best choice, but I do believe I am one of the bravest.
Judge me as you will.
Trump will destroy the American experiment and invite fascism into our home. We
have people to nurture and protect, and authoritarianism prevents us from doing
so.
He would deprive us of our light, and frankly he already has.
He would deprive us of our liberty, and his plans to do so are clear and
apparent.
He would deprive us of our lives, and history has shown that this is a
precedent.
I do not consent to a Trump presidency. I do not consent to his corruption any
longer. No more will I or my people be governed by such evil. We will fight
back, of this I am certain.
My demands are threefold.
First, I demand that Trump be replaced by a moderate republican. Hold a primary
and let Democrats vote. If none of your candidates work for us, pick a new
roster and try again.
The second is that Trump must be executed for treasonous high crimes. Nothing
less than execution will suffice.
Next, let the supreme court be purged and replaced. Half with democrats, half
republicans, and one moderate who is widely regarded with respect.
Failing these demands, I am willing to wage a terrible civil war for the soul
of our country. I know this is treason, but I do it anyway even though I am a
patriot. I do it because our land has been stolen by a man and his followers
who seek to plunge my people into despair.
He is but one man. So am I.
He has an army of followers. I do not.
Each of the wars we fight will be smaller than the last, as each of our cities
struggles toward our last gasp.
But together we are strong, and by connecting them we might deliver ourselves
from harm.
Against the far right, we must secure a cleansing blow. There is no greater
fight. The world is watching.
To that end, I suggest a great and perilous fight. I see no other option in
this remarkable century. Prepare as you might, I suggest pushups and resource
acquisition.
Deliver your resources somewhere safe if you're in a red area, and meet your
neighbors if you're not.
A blue city in a red state must survive a siege. Prepare yourself for this.
Assume that supplies will need to be delivered by convoy if by land, and drone
airdrop from the skies. Develop ways to protect these supply methods.
Public spaces are our homes now, our houses are just where we sleep.
I swear this to you: on my life I will be honorable and fair. I will seek true
justice when I can, where everyone gets what they want, and failing that I will
be plainly just. I will respect all peoples, and do my best to fight for a
brighter tomorrow.
I dare for the bright age. I see nothing else that I'd like to spend my life
doing than daring.

capitalism, fundamentally, is not about making products or profits.
I'll give you a hint.
I could be one of the greatest programmers in the world, but I just can't seem
to find any professional experience, though I ask for it quite often.
why is that?
does the systems of control and 'pression allow me to contribute to building
products or profits? No, neither products nor profits are contributed to, which
contributes to the fact that I have little professional experience building
products and profits.
yet I am quite talented in a variety of disciplines, including but not limited
to computer programming.
maybe I just optimized for skills that would be useful outside of the workplace
environment instead of optimizing for skills that would be useful inside of the
workplace environment.
or maybe the entire system is designed not to create products and profits, but
rather to develop systems of control, hierarchy, & most importantly structure
for all the vagabond apes looking for meals.

honestly, how hard could it be to set up a basic youtube replacement which
gave 100% of the ad revenue (togglable by the viewer) directly to the video
creator and charged a subscription to both the creators and the viewers /
single fee from the guests to pay for the AWS infrastructure or whatever
generic platform upon which it is hosted might be.
probably accomplishable in less than a year and maybe a thousand human-hours,
if they know what they're doing. Make it 2 if they don't.
profit is evil because once it's built, it's been made, and it'll never go
away. Not in the internet age and day. So why bother with the gross product and
revenue essentials? build something, then leave it alone and trust that it'll
stay sharp. Honestly, just let the users build upon the source-code, so they
can add security improvements or open holes for security bugs so they can be
paid to make security improvements. not too hard, but also not your problem, so
build it and then move on.

"capitalism brings real value into the world" says my father, in my words, the
millionaire who lost his retirement to the jaws of 2008 and its "recession"
"oh the people are having too much fun, let's recede back to a more plaintive
state"
when we raised cattle on the farm I grew up on, we produced enough meat to feed
our friends and family. That was enough. That was more than enough. They gave
us whatever they made, and it worked out. Everyone could specialize, and
everyone got fed, with plenty to spare.
then, wanderlust tempted him, and we lost what we had. I'm not bitter - I know
now that place would have kept me and never let me go. But I still miss it.
"you know, you can do projects and make companies of workers who do projects
and bring real value into the world even if you live in the middle of the
desert"
ah but what if nobody really socializes outside of their church and your family

it's trivial to run a C compiler inside of a lua interpretation of a script.
And vice versa - you could totally run lua functions from C. Just point to the
spot in memory where they're stored / operating, and call
"update_class_exhibitor_type_d()" and the linker will come along and say "huh
this looks like something from this library that's part of the requirements up
above" (the "includes" section is where you say which files include the
functions you're going to be calling) and in this particular case it would see
that you need to start up a lua interpreter inside of the [either compiler or
running program I can't remember] to properly execute the function of the
function that you're pointing at with a lua-pointer style data object which is
part of a struct that stores all the other lua functions in a spot in memory.
this would enable you to write computer programs in whatever language you
choose, and build them into one large project. Essentially opening up software

Game designers should reward players for playing multiplayer games, not for
being good at playing multiplayer games.
They should still have a ranking, and matchmake against similarly skilled foes,
while also putting high level players amongst low level players occasionally
(and fairly, so maybe one on each team "smurf" style) in order to both teach
the low level players and let the high level player have catharsis.
When players are rewarded for being good, they stop playing the game to enjoy
it. That's fine, but both pickup games and NBA can exist at once and its not
due to the logistics of organizing a large group of skilled basketball players.
It's not always about skill.
By rewarding players for the number and quality of games they play, (so, no
afk-ing or throwing outside of being drunk or whatever) not only can you
increase engagement but also you encourage low-level and low-skill players to
compete just as much. Especially if you tell them "hey, we'll match you up with

when your contracting company sends your resume to an employer, send your own
copy as well. They can choose to deal with your union representative or
directly with you, which will take up time during each of your day. however
unions are more easily dealt with because the issues they deal with are the
ones that impact most of their workplace. it's up to the scale of the company
and project so it's really on a case-by-case.

to help cool down in arid environments, have water dripping from a faucet onto
a wet towel or cloth. Then when you pass by you can wipe down and it's super
refreshing. Can do a sponge or paper towel too if you want.
this helps keep the air moist because the water will slowly evaporate from the
driest parts of the cloth instead of rolling down a drain-pipe-hole and going
into the ocean.
moist air is cool air. Helps if you live somewhere with increased air pressure,
like a valley or a coast.
especially with wind. not too much, otherwise it gets sandy, just enough to
feel nice when the sweat is upon your back.
"but what about all the other places that aren't perfect?"
oh, well, different places require different adjustments to the environment.

like...int int_main(){ return 0; }
orint int_modulation_gauge_percentage_point_plus_or_minus_engagement = 0;
seeeee if the "int" value is at the start of the name then you can do this
too:double double_modulation_gauge_percentage_point_plus_or_minus_engagement =
0.0;
then when you go to fill in an "int" value you know to use the one that has the
"int" value at the beginning (doh)
(do you really think they haven't tried that already? it... sorta worked.
people started doing things like "int int_a; int int_b; int int_c;" and such
and that got confusing pretty quick because the letters weren't at the start of

int B = int_b; int C = int_c;" and then just use the capitalized letters.

I personally feel like if a part of a building is primarily structural, it
should be legal and allowed to graffiti it as much as you want. Including by
painting over it with a single color, to give a blank canvas.
if a part of a building is intended to be artistic rather than structural,
perhaps it shouldn't be allowed. But still legal.
with a special exception for bathroom stalls, which are fun to draw on and
should have a sharpie-on-a-string within easy reach
if you graffiti an artistic piece, then it changes the message without the
consent of the structure/sculpture's creator. I personally believe that is
wrong, and therefore we should be respectful for all pieces of art.
in addition, I believe that art cannot be permanently sold - it should always
be leased, with a variable payment plan frequency, price, and duration.

pan on medium heat with some butter and whatever seasonings you want for a
while, stirring only when they start to stick. Just enough to brown them, not
burn them.
butter and salt and garlic and boullion are your friends. don't do too much, if

the county jail, we can pretend to be wizards sneaking in to retrieve the staff
of Dolomis the Wanderer who coincidentally must be carried by the last person
who fought the one who slayed the last person to hold it.
... what? oh, so, like... it can only be carried by your enemy?
something like that. anyway it's currently held by a zealot for a religious

you can just, make a company, and it can work toward whatever goals you want.
It doesn't have to be profit - and in fact most companies don't seek profit at
first. They seek to fulfill the vision of their visionaries.
it's only once the company is bought by opportunist investors does it start to
go downhill. Remember when google changed their motto to not be "don't be
evil"? that's an example. The company was sold, or maybe was corrupted by rapid
success, and so it started to seek power.
People worry about Steam for good reason. It's a trend.
anyway, if a person wanted to hunt bad cops, they'd probably start by talking
to a good cop. gee sure wish I knew any.

design the guild, design the capital, then design their path through mordaunts.
easy peasy.
design the guild like a museum. Each spot there's an exhibit which teaches the
randomly generated rolled statistics hero something new. Maybe it teaches them
how to use certain weaponry, maybe it teaches them how to use a bow. Whatever
the spell might be, they can learn it, and use their randomly rolled statistics
to cast spells that scale differently depending on how their character has been
built.
design the capital like a flow diagram, if horses need feed and forged steel
(for their shoes) then send the outputs of a blacksmith and the outputs of the
farmers to the inputs of the stables. Everything has to go somewhere, but the
streets are only so wide. You'll have to coordinate the traffic diagram if you
want it to go anywhere useful.
design the path through the mordaunts. Fighting skeletons teaches you about
perseverence and the ability to crush bones, while goblins teach you to always
be wary of attack. The sacred grove held blessed berries, and now that the land
is liberated from the evil bandits preying on villagers those berries can be
carted into town and used to make an antidote which heals death poison caused
by the scorpions in the desert (and city rats)
design the ruler's schedule like a calendar where each event gives them a bonus
on all the ones that come later. Just make sure that they don't get knifed in
the posterier or driven mad by the whispers of the orb... or perhaps just the
stress of running a kingdom.
(how do you simulate that? you can't! you can't simulate humans!)

here's the thing. protests are more like festivals where people get to immerse
themselves in political culture rather than efforts to affect meaningful
change. I think that's okay? Let them have festivals.
Meaningful change comes from the people's presence. Technically they're
present, but they'll be gone tomorrow, so were they ever really there?
Still think it's a good thing. You can get rough numbers of how many people
will eventually be on your side once they're forced to choose between victory
or death. The status quo won't last, and I don't fault them for clinging to it

make sure they're different colors. Ideally, one layer totally black, the other
completely colorful.
then if you ever need to you can strip one layer and become someone else.
They're just clothes, they grow on trees in stores.
speaking of stores, if you're ever going to do anything spicy, make sure you
wear that outfit exactly once, unless it's all black. Jeans are okay too since
they all usually look pretty similar.

yeah okay point taken.
How about this:
for every large decision, write a little essay about why you made the choice
that you did.
Observe, Orient, Decide, Act, Explain. OODAX : )
Make sure you connect your goal to one or more of these three colors:
red : people
green : places
blue : things
and then explain which numbers you're going to gather to determine whether or
not it worked.
If someone has a problem with your choice, show them the essay, and let them
write an essay of their own.
If they still have a problem, then let someone you both respect decide which
one to use.

Capitalism, or more specifically the fascism and despair it entails, is the one
true enemy of all those who yearn for a better and brighter world.
Many cannot imagine such a world. They have never tasted it.
Many would resist such a world. They prefer the darkness, for it lets their
darkest parts blend in.
Many would deny such a world. They do not think it is possible, or they fear
the turmoil.
I am not afraid of turmoil. I am not afraid of death. I like all my stuff, and
would hate to see it lost, but I can get more stuff. I like my cat, and would
hate to see her wander the streets, but she has lived longer than most cats. I
like my computer, my poetry, my memories from friends and family, but all those
things are meaningless in the face of the struggle.
I am but one person, and I will do all that I can.

"but I don't hear the people sing"
oh yeah that's because we've been alienated all our lives and we forgot how.
That song was written when it was normal to sing like that. Give it a couple
years and we'll be back to our regular human spirit, but for now we gotta work
with what capitalism gave us.
I don't blame boomers, or republicans, or zoomers, or russians, or hell even
the oligarchs themselves. I consider it a spark of human nature, that we might
fight for our right to power. However, power corrupts, and human nature doesn't
"get" that because it can't.
Humans are dumb. They're just animals. I'm just an animal. But only one
creature to have ever existed has ever set foot on the moon, and I think it's
our birthright to do so much more.
Contingent on that future is the ability to breathe clean air, swim in clear
water, and rest under shading boughs, all of which are set to be lit alight if
the capitalists allow us the indignity of a Bladerunner future.

I think it's perfectly spiritually ethical to have sex with a pokemon.
their totemic spirits are sourced entirely from humanity - they are our
creations, ours to use as we please.
however if you for example had sex with a horse or a goat or a sheep or a llama
or a mouse then suddenly all the animals who lived before and live still and
still yet breathe are suddenly part of the dance.
like, when you "leave room for jesus" as you dance on the basketball room
floor, you're inviting along a totemic spirit and saying "hey there god, what
do you think of us? shall we be united as lovers in our fate, or does our wind
blow at a different pace?"
similarly, when you have sex with a horse or a goat or a sheep or a llama or a
mouse or any other animal besides, you're inviting along their totemic spirit.
And frankly the fact that you can't have kids together means that most animals
with us don't quite get along.

This Reddit thread is wild to me. Like... Why did the designers of Androids and
iPhone just... stop designing ways to safely and easily transfer files? Why the
heck doesn't every android have a built-in SSH server that automatically and
permanently pairs to your PC using an automatically managed private key the
first time you plug it in? The user doesn't care about security, they just want
to click on a picture, click the "view on PC" button, and then open up their
downloads folder. (paraphrasing the comments) - so why don't we make that
happen. What happened to tech, that we stopped working as soon as the consumer
decided they wouldn't pay for it? (it being a file transfer service)
It's like healthcare. You don't stop treating someone when they're healthy, you

Of course, the easiest to play games are the ones that only really use one

when I think of crowd sizes, I don't think "we're winning! hooray!" I think
"okay so what are they up to, where are those people, what caused them to
disappear, are they busy or are they dead" because questions like that provide
strategic value, while statements like "we're winning! hooray!" improve morale.
I'm not in charge of morale. I'm not in charge of anything, but mostly because
I'm too public for that kind of thing. Morale is important, it's perhaps the

Growing up, I started with 3 video games - Super Mario Deluxe, Dragon Warrior
1&2, and Asteroids. For the gameboy color. Then, a year or two later (what felt
like forever), Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
Classics. I was so lucky. Not because it was more expensive than my peers, but
because I had the right games.
Others joined later, Tetris, Mario Kart, Star Fox, etc... But having so few
that were so good for so long made me adore them. I would play for about an
hour a day, any more would cut into my imaginative play-time.
I did not dream of games. But I craved their moments.
These days, I play games for so long that I dream of them. In my most
vulnerable moments I treat them like my baseline state, rather than a
prescribed appointment of delight.
I miss wandering around without thinking of my objective. The games seemed to

if you're running for office we should train an LLM on your social media posts
and let people talk to it to see if you're actually a psycho in disguise.
it's just statistics
you can't fool statistics
Then we should give you a chance to explain yourself and how you've learned
from your most cringey mistakes. It'd also give you an opportunity to reify
your principles and stand fast to the things people disagree with you on.
and if that sounds a little too dystopian, then maybe we could just have the
LLMs debate each other and continue outputting text until they actually say
something conclusive. Then throw it through a sanitized, general LLM which
strips out all the trumpisms and fluff (with the original of course available
for viewing)
notice I said we should TRAIN an LLM on your data, not pass it into an existing
LLM. That way there'd be no outside biases.
If there isnt enough data then... maybe you can have a hot-seat rapid
back-and-forth session or three to clarify your positions on things.

cool! my tip is to walk down the aisles and look at at least one book per aisle
- whichever you feel called to, don't question it too much. Then just grab
whichever one you're most interested in learning more about and BOOK IT out of
the store before they can tackle you to the ground while yelling "STOP THIEF"
if you're lucky there'll be an old grandma in the background crying and maybe a
kid saying "mommy why are they tackling that poor person" and the mom will say
"hush now this kind of thing happens, say would you like some icecream?" and
before you know it they're down the street and out of earshot just as the
handcuffs clink into place. Unfortunately you'll forever be banned from that
bookstore and you'll never know what secrets were held within those pages, but
at least you'll have some shiny new bracelets, if only for a time.

received a letter from the "higher ups" that said something along the lines of:
"to combat the threat of your unionization efforts, we have decided to take the
company in a different direction. We've rebranded ourselves as a company by and
for [alt-right cis dude-bros] and everyone who doesn't fit in will be given
increasingly difficult workloads until they quit, because we don't want you
around.
In addition, our long-term vision statement has changed toward our ultimate
goal of cloning famous sith lords from history (starting with Count Dooku) and
working to build a new empire of the darkside. We look forward to working with
you in the future. Sincerely, your bosses."
they went to the boss who wrote it and said "is this real or a joke" and he
said it was real, so then like 6 people took out battleaxes and fucking
murdered him in cold blood.

Internationalize amazon and walmart and you'll have fixed most of the problems
of globalism.
But you can't fix anything if you don't have power...
It's important to focus on how to get power. Keep in mind "what to do when you
have power" but don't let it dominate your thoughts. Focus on claiming your
right to determination.
Steps to revolution:
1. Invert power structures with unions
2. Care for people with mutual aid
3. Vote for the Democrat so we have a few more years of peace
4. Teach people to always be learning
5. Connect to people on a personal or spiritual level
6. Make the world a better place, whether that's by sweeping a street corner or
helping people smile, it doesn't really matter how. What matters is the
intention.
7. Improve your self and your life. Do pushups, eat better, drink more water,
spend time writing (writing is thinking), and take time to sit and stare at the
flowers.
8. Kill the part of yourself that cringes. Everyone's figuring things out and
its okay to say "haha okay then"
9. Spend time with animals.
10. Make mistakes. Apologize for them. Learn from them. Stay mobile in your
character. Develop new ways of being.
11. React with vigor when the time comes. This vigor will only be violent if it
is caused by violence. Much more likely is a strength through organization. We
can do it if we do it together!
12. Show up every day, but don't hang around if everyone's resting at home.
It's okay to stop showing up if things are on pause.
13. Trust that your allies are working. Or resting. Or preparing.
14. Plans change, planning remains.
15. Dream of a better future. It is within reach.

after all, according to their own capitalist theory, money is just an

"trends towards efficiency" (yeah right) the data corresponding to "what is
most efficient" is just as useful as the money that actually describes the
"flow" of goods and services through the made-up economy
so surely we could abolish currency and simply utilize an interest based
economy based on what we're naturally drawn to as humans, right? Oh wait WALL-E

since I quit cannabis like, a month ago or whatever, my artistic output has
dropped by ~90%
my house is a little cleaner, but I still feel consistent spikes of negative
emotions.
I still have trouble with all the same things I used to, like buying groceries,
filling hormone prescriptions (seriously why is it EVERY month jeezzz) and
working on productive projects
I still spend hours staring at the wall begging myself to do anything else,
like a prisoner in my own form
I still feel like all the delusional thinking is still around (kinda hard to
tell haha who would have thought) but I'm seriously missing the magical
thinking, which was basically the same only it was fun and silly and positive.
Now there's only negativity.
I'm still hyper-critical of myself and others, I still make myself and others
feel like shit, and I'm still a bad person who believes all the right things
but still can't seem to make a positive impact in people's lives.

today I had someone ask me for an apology. They've asked several times before,

for being persistent, but not for being impulsive, and that wasn't good enough.
I can't help being impulsive! I'm adventurous! I crave excitement and joy!
But I'm sorry that I pushed him too hard. I'm sorry I hurt him. And...
apparently that's not good enough. He doesn't want me in his life, he can't
fucking let it go. And he calls me selfish. Says I don't respect him, based on
one night out of 5 years where I tried too hard to get him to enjoy life.
I'm sorry I can't fix your depression, guy, but like, at least I tried. You
could have at least tried the things I suggested. You could have at least tried

suburban socialist future:
need groceries? walk down the street until you find a car, then drive it to the
store. There's room for like, 10 cars there because the rest of the space has
been taken up by market stands. Inside the stores themselves are mostly storage
but you can walk through them if it's raining. When you need to go home, take a
different car and leave it in your driveway.
going on a trip? walk around until you find the right kind (a truck for
camping, for example, or a gas car for interstate travel) then put it in your
garage and close the door. That way you can reliably have it in the morning.
why do we own cars? when they were scarce, people coveted them. They were
status symbols. But... people are people, who cares about what objects they
surround themselves with?
"but Ritz I really like my car" - okay then spend your garage on it. I think
most people would rather have a place in the shade where they can spend time
with their neighbors, but what do I know.

A child's schooling should consist of the bare-minimum amount of mental labor
necessary to teach them the fundamentals of arithmetic, reading, and writing.
They must be given opportunities to apply themselves toward educational goals
beyond such things, including social proficiency, and physical dexterity and
strength, and specialization in a particular academic subject.
Kids need freedom. They need community, not "social time" that does not consist
of anything more than living in the same rooms at school as the other kids.
They need to be able to visit each other whenever they want.
I personally believe that lectures taught in an interesting and engaging way
are significantly more effective at instilling a drive to learn than rigorous
drilling of detailed information. A kid will not learn a sufficient amount of
information in school to be useful in a particular topic unless they seek out
the knowledge on their own. Universities attempt to "fake" this effect by
getting them to research.

intentionally going slow and not meeting their reasonable deadlines, then they
can be sued, and that's a whole process during which the "cease and desist"-ed
project can't legally be used by anyone.
the deadlines are set based on the scope of the project and the capabilities of
the team, capabilities which may be augmented by the infusion of dosh by the
parent company.
At the end, the product must be completely publicly owned, as in

well, the idea is that they would handle all the tech debt and merge requests
and bugfixes and such - the kind of things that aren't very interesting to work
on. That way, the people who are most dedicated and passionate for the project
have a way to clear out their backlog and start as if from scratch.
Plus, if they later don't understand how or why something was implemented, they
could always message the person who implemented it and say "hey why did you do
it this way I had it this other way before" and then they could reply and say
"oh yeah because of this-and-this system we implemented for these-or-that
caching reasons related to integer flow through the syncretic binary op-code
delimiter" and then actually wait no maybe you're right, I see what you mean
well... they don't have to merge everything if they don't want to. They could
just... ignore the parts that people worked on that they don't want to include
in the project. I'm thinking it'd be an opt-in thing too, so someone could

I don't want power, I want *control*, over my own life at least, and at most
whatever I am suited to designing.
And in order to prevent control from becoming power, it must not only be
decentralized and distributed amongst all who are impacted by it, said control
must also be paired with a burden of responsibility.
There must be no malice in judgement, no fear in foresight, no hatred in
organizing. This is the responsibility of those who would hold unnatural power
over others - the kind that are bourne on the contracts and procedures of
institution.
If the powerful do not seek to relinquish it, then perhaps they do no deserve
it. And yet a nation of Cincinnatuses would surely fall to weakness, as the
strength that they covet is replaced by whoever they can get to fill the role.
Not ideal.
Instead, a human should *revel* in their strength. The will to power is the
will to passion, and passion is intrinsically human.
However, power corrupts, and all humans should seek to avoid corruption, or at
least to keep it at bay. To do so, a person must consider their impulses and
listen to the words of the unspoken for. Only then may they overcome the perils
of control without reason.

If you have a thousand options in your case / switch statement, you should
probably refactor.
consider putting function pointers (to the things you would have switched to)
in an array and instead of checking "if this enum, then this, if that enum,
then that" etc send an index into the function pointer array. That way there's
no branching at all.
The best way to generate performant code is to reduce or eliminate branches. If
you're working on a video game or networked program, this can be incredibly
important.
The second best way is probably reducing cache misses and increasing
parallelism, but those are different problems.

This month, I was diagnosed with Schizotypal disorder. I had a single hour to
talk to a psychiatrist (thank you, insurance) and he explicitly told me that my
diagnosis was preliminary.
Schizotypal is a type of neurodivergence similar to autism but with elements of
schizophrenia (paranoia, delusional and / or magical thinking) and my
presentation includes ADHD symptoms such as difficulty focusing. When medicated,
I have difficulty concentrating, however the paranoia and delusional thinking is
suppressed. The treatment plan is ongoing and developing.
These issues have been present for the entire time I've been at WGU, and before.
However, I am seeking treatment now because I had begun to have difficulty
maintaining a job and keeping a home.
Currently, my medication is working. However the greatest issue facing me right
now is financial problems - I couldn't maintain a job while unmedicated, and
frankly while medicated I am still having difficulty for different reasons.
However the intent is to refine the medication choices to find a solution that
works for me. However, employment is still a concern, and so I have requested
and been approved for a term break of at least 2 months with the option to
extend. During this term break I intend to resolve the financial issue however
I can. Ideally in such a way that will allow me to apply myself toward school
work.
This degree is important to me. Without it, I won't be able to find employment
in the tech industry aside from technician roles. My previous experience with
them has given me experience, and I learned quite a bit... Until I ran out of
things to learn. I do not believe I could handle that type of work long-term for
various reasons. In the short term, I may attempt it but I am convinced that I
will burn out quickly.
I currently feel as if I am disabled. I don't know if it's true, perhaps I'm
just going through a rough patch. But once my savings hit zero, I'm out on the
streets, and I won't live long like that.
When thinking about whether or not I'll be able to complete my degree, I
honestly cannot give you an answer. I've been in higher education for over a
decade, surely I should have finished by now. But I cannot get over various
hurdles it seems, and frankly I have no idea why. It's... Maddening, to see
yourself, so full of potential, yet chained to the form and circumstances you
are given. I wonder what choices might I have made differently to avoid my fate,
if it truly is my fate to fail in this way, but I have no answers.
I am intelligent, of this I am certain. I know more about computers than anybody
I know, and I would love to apply myself toward them. But I lack a degree, so I
cannot be seen by recruiters and hiring managers. I try to work on my degree,
but I find the words on the page grow dense like the forest between the trees,
and I cannot see a way through to reach new understandings. Why do I keep
learning these things? I already know what a callback function is, what
interfaces are used for, how to implement safe multithreading in a parallel
environment, I know how networking protocols interact with hardware and how the
airflow through a case affects the thermals of a computer's internals. I've
grown crystallized in my knowledge, it seems, due to the endless pursuit of
these foundations. I think I would excel in the higher-level courses, but... I
can't get there. I crave the insights that might be learned in a master's
degree, but my brain is not wired for homework. I'm not built to cram for tests,
to learn someone's else's tools and frameworks. I don't know what I could be
doing better, it feels like I'm so alone. I guess it's my own fault for picking
an online school, but WGU is the best of the online schools, and I needed online
because I move around a lot. Well... I used to. My boyfriend moved around a lot,
but now he's my ex-boyfriend. Oh well.
... Anyway you can probably see why I have difficulty with school. It's
difficult for me to stay on track. I can start working on my project 5 or 6
times in a day and make marginal at best progress, and each time it hurts more
and more to return. I don't have an answer, but I don't know what to do if not
to pursue my degree. I feel as if I'm on the brink of despair in my life, and if
you read these appeals often, I imagine you hear that a lot.
I will apply myself more to my coursework. Once I find a job, I will give
everything to my school, even as it breaks me. I am... intense, and I feel
strongly that I must get this degree. Between it and me, there is quicksand, but
I must get through.
Thank you for your consideration. I understand however you decide. If I can knab
a decent job, I might be able to pay for my degree myself, given a couple months
to save up for it. But I highly doubt I could find such a thing in this economy
and this life I do lead.
Please consider me, I will accept any aid that is offered.

pay (or not) through the creator's patreon page or whatever that they
definitely set up and which definitely shouldn't be able to levy a tax based on
"transaction fees" for a process which definitely should be handled by the
government, which claims to regulate our economy and provide the means by which
we engage with said economy through their de-facto nationalization of the banks

Similarly, if someone wants to "perform" a piece of digital media, via a "let's
play" or perhaps a ROM hack or public screening, the copyright holder cannot be
allowed to prevent them from doing so. They must only be able to demand a
reasonable and non-exclusive fee in return for the privilege of performance.
These performances are considered derivative works, but they are still works on
their own, and therefore should be able to be sold.
The greater the difference between the original and the newly created work, the
less the price must reflect the necessary "tax" levied by the original owner,
until eventually the work is so distinct that it cannot be considered to be
deriving from the original at all.
Consider a mod for a video game that replaces the dragons you typically fight
with giant cartoonish train engines. A silly sight to be sure, but people do
that. What percentage of the game is replaced? what percentage tax of the new
mod's price must be given to the original copyright holder?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Much the same way that it is legal to create trash in a public park, but
illegal to leave it behind, so too should it be legal to move digital media
files from one owner to another, and illegal to not delete the original.
The dual operation of copy+delete must be legalized, while maintaining that the
copy operation alone is illegal, aside from personal backups.
How could you enforce that? Well... You can't. Your computer will do whatever
you tell it to, and if you change that fact then you necessarily remove one of
the primary use-cases of computation - the ability to command specific
instructions and be delivered a perfectly mechanical and deterministic result.
(random number generation aside, which isn't truly random at all).
Therefore, just as littering in a public place is generally considered to be
enforced by the "honor rule", so too must this new legislation governing the
transference of digital media be enforced as such.

If I, having watched a DVD, handed it to a friend to watch, would I be
committing piracy? Only if I sold it to him.
The material being transferred is that of the copyright holder - they hold the
sole and monopolized right to sell their copy of the work.
But if I, having created my own recording of the same digital media DVD but
spoken in my own voice, tried to sell it, should it be considered legal?
My mind goes to the production of after-school plays that high-school children
will perform. The scripts that they use are licensed for a single purpose - the
performance of a single play, performed a single time (or a few times over the
course of a couple weeks). The owner of the play cannot require them to not
perform the play more than a certain amount of time, it is however honorable to
buy the scripts again if they want to perform it in 5 years time. I know for a
fact there is rampant piracy that goes on for the beautiful works that are
created by assholes or stingy companies. A script is just words.

... I do believe it should be, and if it is, then I do believe it should be
legal to transfer digital media, as the inscription upon one hard drive or the
other is as easily changed as a book might be handed to another.
the difference, of course, is that any move on a digital medium requires a
copy+delete operation. You cannot move a file on your computer, you first copy
it to the new location and then delete the original. This dual-operation is
abstracted away for the user, but that is how it must be done on a mechanical
level. There is no other way to do it.
Therefore, software piracy only applies if a person copies their file and does
not delete the original. Surely, to move a piece of digital media from one
folder-directory to another is legal? If so, then the mechanical process of
giving that media to another must be legal as well, so long as the original is
deleted.

a man walks into a library, picks a book, takes it home (legally), and begins
to read.
halfway through, he realizes there are three pages missing.
"How queer!" he thinks to himself, and takes it upon himself to fix this book.
So, he finds another copy of the book, scans those three pages, prints them out
at just the right size, and attaches them to the library book.
when finished reading the book, he returns it to the library without mentioning
his good deed.
if this action he performed is to be considered legal, then it should be
considered a transition of the medium that the media was inscribed upon.
Similarly, if the book was digital, and inscribed upon the owner's hard drive
using magnetic storage of zeroes and ones, would it be legal to repair said
book if one of the many .txt file chapters were missing?

work on seasoning them.
Level 2 is paprika, garlic powder, onion flakes, lime juice, and red pepper
flakes for spice.
level 3 is learning the difference between basil, oregano, parsley, and other
herbs.
be careful with salt and pepper. They can do a lot, but they can also easily do
too much. better to salt to taste.
also, MSG is wonderful for savory dishes. Your body breaks it down into sodium
in your stomach acid so imagine you're adding salt when considering MSG for

"Elizabeth Moon's trilogy feels like it comes from an alternate history or an
extinct branch of the evolution of fantasy. It has a bit of a cult following,
from what I can tell it has been more or less continuously in print since its
release in 1988, but it -- and its author -- have mostly faded into midlist
obscurity. It offers a ton of things that are uncommon in fantasy nowadays, so
people looking for something a bit different might check it out."

shallow conversations are hardly effective, I find. Unless they're logistical,
and then they're just passing information - they're hardly conversational.
To me, a conversation is a back-and-forth. It needs to have change, people need
to consider, to argue their ideas, to wander through thoughts, to share
emotions, and / or to resolve conflict, whether internal or external. It can
have some of those, all of those, or none of those, but that's what comes to my
mind.

the fascist's plan requires them to lose. Their whole business model is to dupe
a succession of rubes and get rich in the process. Trump being elected the
first time was a surprise, which is why they couldn't manage to get much done.
The infrastructure needed to legitimize fascism was resisted at every turn by
the lawyers and government workers who were in place.
however, due to a recent supreme court ruling, they no longer need to worry
about people resisting their rule through the powers granted to them by their
stations. All they have to do is ask if they're loyal, and if not, they can be
replaced.
In 2016 they just wanted to get rich. Recently they had a shot, thank god that
Biden is a savvy politician and knew how to tank their attention and focus
their attacks on weaknesses that Kamala did not possess, like his age and
mental lucidity.
They are going to lose, they know it, and they're going to be pissed, so... be
ready for that.
on the bright side, they will lose each time

then, when you go to the store, look through all the empty containers and make

what if we took all the "good cops" and made them into a militia that protected
us from the far right
oh, we did, and that was basically the revolutionary war. If you consider
monarchy to be "far right" which I kinda do?
that was hundreds of years ago, though. Plenty of time for it since to twist
into the police-industrial-complex or whatever.
don't get me started on the rampant security theatre... people will do anything
to feel safe, even sacrifice a bit of freedom for it. something tells me
perhaps they deserve neither.

my understanding of the police force in america is that it's like, 15% racist
misogynistic assholes who pull people over for stupid reasons and try to start
shit, and 75% people who just want to do a good job and support their community.
problem is, if their community is racist assholes then they tend to align as
such.
the remaining 10% are idealists who have the power to sway their comrades in a

low key kinda pissed that all my ideas for starting a business require funding,
because funding tends to be controlled by the "business major" types, and all

means they're unlikely to invest in me or utilize my ideas.
unless of course it's crowd-funded, which makes me feel bad because it's taking
money from the people I'm trying to empower.
thus, power accretes in the hands of the wealthy, as the poor are too sick with

not be rich if they did so themselves.

worse, they might grow to fill their cosmic shoes and destroy others nearby who
didn't make weapons.
it takes a while for the Federation to get anywhere. Plus they're stretched
pretty thin. If they gave everyone the same technology as they had, they'd
quickly find themselves in the company of despots and warlords who were
empowered to subjugate and control. Not ideal.
Personally I think they should announce their arrival and offer citizenship to
anyone who asked to be uplifted, while barring them from ever returning home

alternatively, when you initiate an SSH session it sends you a randomized
public key whose private key is the password that you need to login. By
decrypting the string of text it sent you and sending it back (plus the
password at the end or whatever) you can ensure secure authentication without
bothering with the passwordless keys which are wayyyyyy more trouble than
they're worth and lack the "something you know" authentication method.

 -> file: fediverse/3468.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
you know how SSH password login is deprecated because the password needs to be
transmitted in cleartext or whatever?
what if we just... required two passwords?
the first initiates the conversation, and sets up an encrypted line. It doesn't
matter if anyone sees the first password because they'll get a new set of
encrypted keys, meaning each session automatically is encrypted in a different,
randomized way.
the second password is the one that actually authenticates you.

the entire capitalist machine runs on like, 50,000% more labor than it needs.
It's not that complicated, it's not very revolutionary, just a lot of
duplicated effort and meaningless communicational transactions.
I'm kind of glad they're getting rid of all the jobs. Maybe it'll free up
people to do something productive, for once, if only we had the capital to
start.

if you want to solve EVERY housing issue in the United States, at least in the
short and mid-term, add a ramping tax penalty for unoccupied houses that
doesn't reset to 0 upon being occupied but rather starts ticking down at the
same rate that it increases.
Something like 0.5% to 1% of the property value for every month it's gone
unoccupied as a primary residence.

you can't start a game of chess with a checkmate. you're not wrong on the goal,

I think they should be viewed in whatever resolution they were recorded in,

videos should be recorded in whatever resolution your monitor supports, and
ideally as high as possible. Unless storage space is a concern, in which case
1080p is more than sufficient.
Storage gets cheaper and cheaper every year, but people across the world upload
like, 200 years of videos to Youtube every day or whatever (made up that number

the white liberals are misguided, often well meaning, but generally oblivious
to issues beyond their sphere. They will go where they are led, and that's
okay, as long as they are led correctly.
the marginalized people are stronger than they know. too bad they don't share a
common language they could use to talk to each other. too bad they don't share
common spaces where they could spend time together. too bad they don't tend to
have similar jobs based on white-liberal biases and the struggles of recently

I have this notion about a math/CS curriculum where students build and program
their own calculators. Once you make the calculator do it you never need to do
it yourself again.
for the same reason that "writing is thinking" is true, so too is "programming
is calculation" true.
by working through the steps required to produce a result, and fully
understanding each step, they have a much more solid understanding of what's
going on than if they practiced rote memorization (worse) or continual
computation (better, not best tho)
especially if every step of the way is accompanied with visual elements which
show exactly what is happening. Some people are more visual, some people are
more algorithmic, and finding a way to teach all types of people is a truly
difficult and rewarding part of teaching.

liberalism is capitalism with a dash of globalism. they are of the right, and
it is important to have a right-wing party because a one-winged bird cannot fly.
there are legitimate benefits to their philosophies, and they may be applied to
all kinds of systems, even those that do not utilize currency at all.
however, in modern america, there is another party, a party farther to the
right, a party which is voted into power based on culture, something
unassailable and inalienable and yet always perpetually under threat. or so
they make it seem.
this "farther-to-the-right" party is duplicitous in it's ideals. their persona
is that of businessmen, familymen, and journeymen. they claim to be farmers,
pastors, and step-fathers.
but they are something more, something behind their mask, that those who vote
for them cannot see.

voting for those who represent you is fine, but those who represent them have
non-cultural agendas as well. their plans are designed to hurt others, an act
which grants them power over others. usually financial power, but there are
many kinds of power, and all of them are unethical when applied

the goat is talking about math, ritz
oh yes of course. the issue is that if you're coming from a math background you
start with the calculation and store it in a variable as an afterthought. but
programming is more algorithmic than computational, meaning things only reduce
at runtime (hidden from the user of course by the compiler)
an algorithmic perspective is "here's a box. Put this value in the box. Use the
box later." while a calculating perspective is "here's some complicated,
difficult equation. Let's wrap it up with a single name so that we can easily
use it later."

Nazis could never claim America because the European Jews were very

liberals, and many more besides. Each of them would fight their own battles but
god is on the side of the plurality of humanity, not the genociders who seek to
prune the trees of the garden of Earth to suit their own shallow fancies.

Essentially all you'd be able to do is "hey leftism right?" "oh yes I also
leftism" "neat" which isn't very productive.
I also live in an environment like that. I do my best to identify people who
stay, because in my experience there are often people who stay. I do this by
walking around the neighborhood when I can, making up excuses to walk to the
dumpster or mailbox at random hours, riding my bike around the area, using the
communal spaces like gyms, swimming pools, and picnic tables, and sitting in my
hammock on my porch lazily noting people who walk past.
People who stay will tend to remain in your mind the more times you see them.
They are better people to talk to than the renters who disappear after 3 months

I love the concept of this! Maybe if HTTP is too complex, you could try another
simpler server? I don't know the complexity of the programs I use every day,
but I'm sure there's one that's very simple. Even just a simple IRC style chat
server that just... sends text from person A to person B depending on their
username (like a glorified Router or Switch)

I love programming!! Currently working on learning decentralized and GPU
oriented computing. It's lots of fun! Plus Bash is a great language, it's not
funky or hacky at all. Just a great language. Haha suuuuch a great thing to
play with.
But GPUs are legitimately cool, aside from Bash's purported funkiness /
hackiness. You can do all kinds of cool things at scale that just don't make

the fascists have to strike now because they know that with AI on the horizon,

whatever, they know that the inherent truth and justice of the left's arguments
will be impossible to ignore.
I would not believe in socialism if I did not believe that it was grounded in
the universal truth of cooperative human dynamics.
I believe in cooperation, humans, and dynamic systems.
Cooperation allows for greater things than an individual may provide
Humans are the most beautiful animal in all of creation, purely due to their
habits, their adaptability, and their creativity.
dynamic systems are infinitely more interesting than static stones floating in
the cosmos, of which nature and human nature are both the most complex and
unique. Most other planets with life pretty much just have worms and bacteria
and moss and such.
Earth has humans. We are Earth.
Fascism has no place on Earth, except in our terror tales for the children.

editing posts is great because you can say one thing, get a like or three, and
suddenly you have a group chat pre-made for you. Sans notifications of course.
... that's way overkill though. who would even do that?
same people who boost one of your posts whenever they want you to look at the
thing on their profile. If they want you to see the fourth thing down, they'll
boost your 4th non-pinned post.
wow that's hardcore, who would even do that? Not me, that's for sure, I don't
have time for that. (legitimately don't have the time nor the brainpower for
that)
also liked posts are inadmissable in court because they can say one thing, then
be edited to say another, and if you liked it once then you've liked it forever.
However the court of public opinion is a largely different matter, because
people will generally believe anything a friend tells them.

They are trying to kill people. To gather power. The mislead and betray. They
seek destruction and little else. They are evil.
Not everyone who votes for Trump is evil... They might simply have been lied
to, repeatedly, and never given a chance to think anything else. But their

catastrophe because I need to explore all the possible alternatives. Including

have unlimited power, right? EVERYTHING you do is powerful. There's no way to
control that! So it cannot be, for it has not been. And surely, surely, shall
not either. Surely, right?

a reason that online discourse and activism doesn't work is because boosting or
re-tweeting something doesn't cause people to see more of that particular thing
unless you consistently boost / retweet those things. This means that unless
people go out of their way to self-select as someone who follows the person you
boosted, there's little future impact on their lives. And the people who are
most likely to do so are the people who are probably already following those
people
social media isn't a community, it's a scene. Meaning there's little contact
between fellow members of a particular topic or discourse.
like, if you go to /r/prequelmemes you're gonna talk about star wars. But
you'll rarely talk about how you butter the sandwich, or whether you believe in
a direct approach, a flanking maneuver, or a slower
more-defensive-but-ramping-in-power build.
so, if you and another person care about the same "activism" then you'll
probably see the same things as someone who also does. So you grow apart, RIP

maybe like... "meta", meaning discussing the topic of discussing the topic. In

... is it raining where you're at? I forget. Ah well whatever. You could go for
a walk, whether or not it's in the rain, which surely would be a better use of
your time. What are you gonna find on social media that you'll remember in a

if you only have a phone, you can still program. Just write it out on paper,
and put the whole program out on the floor.
Screens will never compare, for they are but a tiny keyhole into the total
program at hand. And you can pick parts of it up and carry them around - so
useful! You could make an entire building out of that. [floorplan, layout, that
kind of thing]
downside is, of course, you don't have a computer, so you have to look up
syntax on your phone.
and eventually you're gonna have to type it, unless you can get a computer to
read it for you.
just imagining office buildings where employees can follow along with monitors
on the wall that explains what they're working on and what they need to resolve

if you have a job, your life is dictated by your corporation just as much as it
is by your government.
And yet corporate leaders are not elected, but rather selected. And that is
unfair for all the reasons that primogeniture was. It is unjust for all the
same reasons that monarchy was. It is a tool of oppression, just like autocracy
is.
The world will never be free until we can be as we choose to be. Our society is
simply too enmeshed with capitalism to destroy it, but we could, with the
minimal required effort, dismantle the corruption and authoritarian control
that is wielded against us as we weld our own chains day after day.
We can replace them. We can vote for them. We can select leaders who know more
than us and are better suited for the role than those who seek only to maximize
profit over all else.

I don't know how much simpler I can state it than this:
power is penance
and yet repentance is scant amongst those chosen to lead us.
Voting slows things down. It gives us room to breathe. It is crucial for
long-term operations. Leaders should be chosen for experience, wisdom, and a
humble lifetime of dedicated service to others.
Executive action is important when reactivity and adaptability are important.
Projects should be undertaken by those chosen for merit and spirit. They should
not be chosen for charisma or gravitas - both can be earned in the line of duty.
Power should not be rewarded. It is it's own reward, the feeling of strength
and control, and it must be wielded with care, precision, and honorable
intention.
Self flagellation and forced humility are self defeating. They are traps that
the greedy fall into when seeking righteous power. They misunderstand the
nature of virtue and seek to claim it for themselves, failing to realize that
virtue helps more than it hedonizes

Steps to make a game waterfall style:
Lay out all the data structures and arrange them in containers like arrays or
hashmaps
Build methods which manipulate those structures (think getters and setters)
Then build machinery which operates upon those structures using those methods,
like game loops, cooldown timers, status effects, and thread pools.
Then develop a way to present it to the player using UIs, visuals and graphics,
narratives, sound, etc. This will probably involve implementing your game in an
engine like Godot, Raylib, or Bevy.
By developing your game in this order, you will DESIGN the systems first, and
IMPLEMENT them second. Systems are agnostic - implementation is tied to a
specific engine. You will learn more about programming by doing it this way,
instead of losing your motivation by learning new tools like game engines or 3D
modeling systems, which aren't useful unless you already have a game.
I'd recommend starting with pencil and paper until you're ready to implement.

it's just... part of navigating your "idea-space-environment". Like... what's
the best tactical decision here? are we going in the right way? where is the
objective? whose lives will have to perish?
good news is that you can do that every-day, whenever you play strategic video
games. It's just practice of course, but the game mechanics that have been made
available to you are the tools you can use to undertake this particular sport.
The sport of leadership, a game or mo-del.

I hear drums in my dreams. Like a vast stampede, we with our pink and
blue-green do proceed. Bannermen to inspire the fight, heroes and saviors who
run to the plight, but bound as we are by our biology and the fact that
humanity is typically pretty cis-neuro-typical, means no struggles are won with
the battle drums of a roving band of twinks and crossdressers.
when I think of parades to be proud of, I think of rolling wagon wheels of
steel, affixed to a train-like-motorcart, strong in conviction and vibrant in
our strength, from the back of which we do proclaim: "Nazi punks fuck off"
I think of the feathers in the hair of those who dance in defiance of the light
of the moon, warm and replete in the bonfire's radiance. I think of this vast
and beautiful land, the land which I cherish above all else for it is the land
of my home. I think of a war tribe, wandering like bandits but kind to our own
kind, with endless colors and sparkles abound.

tips for escaping a fey dimension:
if you notice one, find some rope and a way to secure it. then, search for the
edge of the anomalous area, and feel where the first indication is that
something is "fey" or "other" than what you're used to.
then, circle around the strange object in question, and try to find the exact
opposite side. keep in mind it may not be an exact circle, and it may be more
twisty-windy on the inside. You don't have to go too far, just enough to close
the purse-snap-close-locket by finding the other edge and dragging your rope
across.
because from a rope, you can develop other platforms and emplacement-ologies,
which may be used to close and secure the strange place that you found.
once on the other side, you can secure your rope and then search for your
superiors. Keep in mind that if it's a chaotic dimension, it's probably best to
just keep it closed. but if it's musing or wistful, you can have little
interactions on the border.
also, you can dive in to rescue your kin, if secured.

Some of my most wanderful times were when I lived in a gated community.
My parents were dumb, and thought, as most people thought, that harm to a child
can only come from outside of the community.
But they fell for the lies of property, where "community" means less of "a
group of people who cares and tends for one another" the kind of which my
parents had never truly known, and more like "this particular residential area
on the map"
which means I could walk around in this gated "community" where the gates are
little more than security theatre for anyone who says "Hi I got a pizza here
for this address which I found on google maps" or "hey I left my sweatshirt at
my sister's house and it has my phone in it, ummmm no I don't remember which
number her house is, nor do I remember her last name"
in those times, I developed a sense of freedom, caged as I was, that for most
comes much later in their time.
Some o my favorite places were part of the golf course next door, where I found

growing up, my family were the most commonly marginalized group of people I can
think of: outsiders
we came to develop friendships, and we found some. But their grandparents
didn't have any stories about us, so we were thought of less.
and then we moved away.
to the city, where my father had developed wanderlust.
we lived in the suburbs just north-south of the east-west highway.
it was different, but sorta the same. My parents wanted to give me more space
to roam. on a farm homestead it's much more controlled but on a smaller scale.
Then, in the city, the equivalent of that is either to live in the mountains or
the barns, and both of those are a-typical experiences.

what if shopping malls (and outdoor malls too) were owned by a union (that was
part of a larger meta-union (which was part of a national union)) comprised of
ONLY the employees who worked at that mall.
They could cross-train themselves and work wherever they wanted on that day, so
long as they filled out their schedule a week in advance. If they didn't care
they could just show up and be assigned wherever they were needed, including
doing back-end work like accounting and managing union business.
would be nice if they could have access to all the capabilities of the
businesses in the mall / marketplace. Need some clothes? Go to the TJ Maxx.
Want some food? There's a korean barbecue place that you're trained at, go make
yourself some food.
So long as you get someone else to write your name down, the union can tell if
you overuse or waste it.
I think this would give them more power over their environment and develop the

there are plenty of pieces of linux that are insecure in some way. Including

that they won't betray you in some way.
pre-built binaries are privacy violations and should be illegal. They are
security threats because the model they're built upon is necessarily insecure.
Computers will never be completely secure because of how they are built, and so
we should use locally compiled software and interpreted scripts.
Unless they're too long, or impossible to read. Who reads EULAs these days? At

trump literally just... told a bunch of rural folks just now getting internet
that the rest of the news was lying to them. how rude. anyway, now they all
listen to him, so, it's a cult of personality. they don't know what he
believes. He doesn't tell anyone, which is why he's so good at acting in the
interest of his-self.
yeah, and you could learn a thing or two from this guy here. see, he fell for
this ruse. then he was consumed with guilt, as he watched from afar as a kid.
pretty intense shadows to live under.
sure would be a shame if they came back for revenge.
I don't know what they expected, honestly, collecting so many souls in one
region or area. Kinda feels impossible to constrain. (like atlas, holding his
shoulderblade on your hometown?)
atlas holds up not the world, but each atom
resting on the weight of his arms.

chronological order, or are you talking to people who will read down the list

chronological order. Ah but if you're writing to people in the future who are
reading this from your backup archive, which is most likely to be the case,
then you should do it in chronological order. Well, that'd be silly though
because none of your followers are online right now, so you should do reverse
chronological order so that they can catch up on your personal feed timeline.

completely?
for every shackle we break, the struggle becomes easier. The hardest part is
the beginning - once the ball is rolling, we may truly shine.
there is no government nor circle of autocrats who may resist the will of an
impassioned people. So long as the military does not deny us our right to
organize ourselves as we will, according to the constitution they swore to
uphold (which is now in peril, I might add), nothing can contain us.
no acts of god nor capital shall prevent our ascension. They will try, and
it'll be just another thing that we have to handle.
But we can take care of each other. For we are good, and we are kind, and we
are cooperative. And so, we cannot be overcome.

He isn't fighting in communal defence. His community was safe from the

only to govern themselves their way. Too bad that sounds like communism, and
the USSR was keen on funding the most violent amongst them if it meant another

@sashin
if people wrote what they thought as fast as they thought it, then you'd have
an approximation of a mind-reading machine.
If the writing kept pace with the thoughts, you'd be writing as fast as the
brain can think (the brain cannot intentionally think "slower" which is one of
the biggest arguments against IQ testing and other conceptions of "linear
intelligence") - you cannot write for 5 minutes straight without thinking about
(and writing) what you are hiding.
uh, yes, you, can. just, pause, after, each, letter, and, increase,,, the pause
amount, after each important word.
yeah but that's still processing the thought as fast as possible and just...
waiting around, idle, until the next thought is to be had. It's just how brains
work.
so anyway it'd be a constant stream of consciousness way of outputting exactly
what the mind-reading machine is saying.
Just make sure you trust the person who made the mind-reader machine, and maybe
make sure it's impossible to tamper with.
or don't make it??

the less a political conversation uses proper nouns, the more productive it can

For example. Try not to mention capitalism, communism, socialism, etc.
Also, don't talk about Republicans or Democrats. That just invites tribalism.
Instead, focus on issues. Like "Hurricane Relief distribution methods" instead
of "whether or not hurricanes deserve to be relieved"
saying something like "gee it sure feels like our community has gone to shreds"
is a good way to start it, and then you can move on to things like "well, I
just think it was nicer last year, before a hurricane came through and took all
our jobs." and they say "uh-huh true yeah I believe you"
but as soon as you say "hey maybe those capitafascist pigs shouldn't be allowed
to wield nuclear arsenals" they start looking at you funny, like they disagree
with whatever you want to say but aren't.

yeah honestly if you stick with obvious things like "don't murder people" and
"don't burn down your neighbor's house just because they winked at your
daughter" and "don't steal gasoline from parked cars" then it's much easier to
make ethical laws because they're just kinda... common sense.
drug regulation can only be simplified to "don't do drugs" which isn't always a
given. If you start with something so clear then most doctors would be out of a
job.
Maybe we should let people do as they please? With certain specific and clear
rights and responsibilities like 'the right the life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness'? And the mandated guarantee that one person's rights end where
another's begin? And with the ultimate goal of dismantling unjustified power
structures with the knowledge that all power is the application of force to a
non-consenting subject?
... yeah I dunno sounds pretty simple to me

for most of my life... [okay still do]... but it felt like I had different
moods, and depending on how I felt at the time I would act differently.
I forget the things that happen when I'm in a different mood, but I've gotten
to a point where I can generally force myself to stay a certain "mood" while in
certain contexts, and in doing so I can remember everything.
downside is I get burnt out pretty easily if I'm always the same. It's not
ideal.

you toward people who "get" you.

if people at home had half as much compassion, respect, and reverence for the
people abroad that the people abroad have for the people at home, we could have
a truly multicultural society.
instead, we get melting pots which melt you down and combine into a new, third
thing. And in America we really have a multitude of miniature melting pots
creating subcultures of racial, religious, professional, or other origin.
Neither approach is entirely good, and neither entirely bad. They're different.
America is the largest melting pot design, but sufficiently large cities find
them popping up in the strangest of places.

@Li
hehe true.
if you consent, then it's just a social structure.
there are, however, reasons when power is justified. Hence why I don't believe
that power itself should be dismantled, and what few "power structures" remain
should be continuously justified.
For example, how do you prevent people from harming others? "Your rights end
where another's begin" but, like, how do you stop people who toe the line and
spit over the edge?
There must be power applied to those who harm, and they surely do not consent
to being curtailed, so therefore power must be wielded by someone. And because
power corrupts the one who wields it, it is inevitable that someone creates
harm.
... I just re-invented the police, didn't I? Legalism only goes so far, and
calling up your beefiest friends to go rough up a no-good do-gooder is
basically what mobs, mafias, and gangs do. I don't think people would consent
to being protected by a gang, much less governed by one.

imagine if there was a stacking inf bonus to players who played on red /
blueside
which increased or decreased depending on either A. the number of players online
at the time, B. the proportion of players playing on that team versus the other,
or C. the time of day. Essentially helping to cure the faction imbalance by
offering rewards to one side or the other which would encourage a certain group
in the population of the game to change sides or not.
perhaps frequent changing could grant a title called "mercenary" or something
like "log in for each consecutive day for 10 days straight and each day switch
faction alignment at least once"
... anyway you could cure the faction imbalance between redside / blueside by
offering an INF reward for playing on each side one by one alternating like an
iterator first red then blue or first blue then red either way it doesn't matter
because it'll switch after a while and encourage everyone to switch sides. And
the way the character responds to that stimulus tells you a bit about their
character's personality.
also...
it should not affect AE or Pocket D farms.
Nor missions, TFs, or anything else.
they should SOLELY impact open world patrolling / hunting.
I believe this would not only incentivize people to spend time in the open world
(which is a mostly unused piece of game assets) but it would also increase the
visibility of the newly bolstered faction numbers.
Think about it - if everyone who switched sides is out in the open world, then
they could see each other. They could fight the same mobs, and team up together.
In doing so, they could form greater and greater supergroups - if only through
their interactions with one another as they level up.
If they're lucky, the guild they're recruited into has similar interests in mind
like doing raiding or PvP or economics or alts or whatever. And they each have
their own different styles of operating, it's soooo cute. Like alt guilds will
pop up and then migrate to a new one as people make new alts and grow tired of
them at higher levels.
It's great.
I love MMOs!
I wish people put half as much effort into making an open source WoW client that
they do programming game engines like Godot or Raylib or Bevy. If such a thing
was created, we could have a new rennaisance in indie MMO development. It would
become fully non-proprietary, the entire game-platform-stack. Meaning anyone
could create their own MMO off of it, because (crucially) the serverside soft-
-ware has already been reverse engineered. And open sourced.
Seriously. You wanna make as much bank as Steam? Make an open source client that
lets you design while in it. Then you could charge people for all the games that
they played that were designed and hosted by you the content designing software
maker.

I believe that self defence is a myth, and should not be relied upon, because
anyone who is rotten in their heart might prey upon you (who might defend

The process you're describing is exile. And that works when you can cast people
out of your stone-walled town. But in the modern era, there are no places for
these people to go, so we hold them with cruel iron bars in cages far
underground.
It's not ideal, but would you rather they find someone else to harm, or would
you rather invite power's corruption into your heart and take an oath to
protect the weak and innocent?
Evil is everyone's problem. It lurks within us, and leaps forth in times of

"something something trump wants to faucet the PNW's water to the desert"
oh, so you're saying that he wants to invest in a massive infrastructural

Surely the best approach would be to make the people who use the most water pay
for it, right? I mean, it's ironic, and related, and it gives them their just
deserts, right?
So make a tax (that's how you make people pay for things) and levy it against
Nestle, who bottles up all of the water in the desert and sells it for pennies
to brown people who can't afford to build water infrastructure because they
keep spending all their pennies on useless things like bottled water.
And make it a big tax, please, so that they're forced to re-evaluate their
business model and divert wealth from their least contributionary workers (aka,
those at the top making millions) and spend it on something useful like
desalination plants or water turbines or whatever.

you'd have strange little competitions between one another. much better to
focus outward, and direct your attention to external areas instead. like china
or the sudan.
"ah but that's murder, you can't abandon a unique part of your whole. For the
same reason that it's important to preserve plant and animal species, because
you never know when some part of them will be utilized for some biological
purpose! We know so little about the natural world, and if we just spent some
time, and energy, we'd realize there's very little else that is precious on
this earth.
who cares about gold. who cares for the jewelry. we're better than decorating
our resumes and polishing our accounts. we, as humans, can solve *every* issue
that animals are likely to face. AND WE DO WHAT? How careless, how vain. To
watch your earth in peril and [vane/vanity]
*there is no more important task to any human on this earth* than the
preservation of our world, our species, and our [heart/heartfelt empathy and
kindness and trust]*
we can figure out the rest later. Real life? what the fuck is that? When's the
last time your life has felt "normal"? We are in DANGER. and you pull children
from traffic, don't you?
*who the fuck gave these people all of your money* they *clearly* haven't got
the will or the talent to well utilize it. Don't you realize that you as a
species can GO wherever you WANT. You can FIX things. [oh dear she's animal cam
again] like BRIDGES that are PASSAGEWAYS over the FLOWS.
... oh deer, they're so passagewayenthusiast. us riverstones love to hear them
walk past, the click of their hooves on the shallow forest's [pourest?].
moss is the most alive. amongst all the species of plants and animals, moss
holds the most life. we are *carbon based lifeforms*, and moss absorbs the most
carbon from the air. It's basically the coolest plant too, because it can be
watered with *misty air*. Hence, why moss is common in the pacific northwest,
canada, and probably forest places in the north of eurasia too idk if they have
moss over there, never been.
anyway rich people who are told "yes" all the time have a difficult time
understanding the nature of choice. I mean, if one of their servants approached
them and asked "hey do you want to build an orphanage in uganda" they'd
probably be like "fuck yeah I do" and then suddenly they're 400,000$ richer
it's not alright. Seriously, how the heck would they even *use* all those
resources? And yeah, I get it, inflation would be sooooo much more expensive,
but here's the thing - inflation is a measurement of how much the rich *take*
from us each year. And it's marginal, too, so 3% inflation means they took 3%
more from you compared to last year.
It's impossible not to accrete as a business, [lega/legal institution], or
governance if you levy a tax. The influx of value has to come from somewhere,
and if each year your groceries are 3% higher in cost, then you are being taxed
3% more.
"Compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe"
- a civilization 3 quote
okay. I don't want to do the math. How, uh... how much is that? Here's the deal
though - the prices of goods and services consistently goes DOWN over time. So
things get cheaper. So it doesn't FEEL like you're being taxed more, but... you
are.
And now they're taking away HOUSES? I mean c'mon they're sticks in the mud.
They aren't worth HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of dollars. We can just BUILD MORE??!?
Honestly you haven't been this extreme since you were still RIDING HORSES. Do
you want your children to be slaves?
okay -.- look -.- so it's really not that hard at all >.> just gotta do what
you're built for and walk. That's it! Take as long as you'd like! All we have
to do is *walk* when we're on strike.
It's easy. You can sit down if you want to, honestly walking for a long time
takes a lot out of you.
But you know what else does? WORKING. Hey we should figure out what's the
optimal amount of break time, so when we really have to work out we can work as
hard as we're able
"yeah I heard from a friend at Company Co. that they do it this way because of
the memory fault cache maintainer. See what he said (in great detail because of
course anyone can know about this most esoteric of concepts) was that you
should rotate the riboflam or serenade the gizmonotron (no I didn't name it)
and then warbles will contain moodles, whose kit-and-kaboodles will timble into
these droplets, and that will fix the hole in your wing, precious royal swan
fable. (yeah you guys get really into it sometimes haha but hey when you're
basically gods, that's how humans are played.)
... anyway I'm going to go play video games, say goodbye to your brothers
(the families of soldiers I blew up in videos games like Call of Duty or the
legend of shadows and raids)
"oh uh yeah sure go for it, we're just bits on the computer we barely knew her"

Linux is cool, and here's the neat thing about computers, you can make it *do
whatever you want to*. Like, how amazing is that! It just, listens to your
commands! That's pretty awesome I gotta say, huh that's weird why does nobody
know how to play
oh I guess I was the only one who grew up on a farm and built computers
*I seriously cannot comprehend how people are as good at things as they are*.
Like... how do people handle groceries and rent and doctor's visits and
penitentiary visits and WOOF it's just so much. I know I'd collapse from a
overused heart.
... a while later ...
okay Warthunder bombers are currently very weak. so here's an idea to
indirectly buff them - increase the amount of land units each team spawns with,
but also every time a player spawns a bomber, it summons like 4 or 5 AI
controlled bombers. And your enemy won't be able to tell which is which if you
fly in formation, so, like... you have suddenly a massive "vehicle" to pilot
and it has 5 weak points. Sorta like a galaga fighter fleet?
with more land targets, there's more score at stake, meaning some players might
pick bombers too and be exposed to other, fun,
[alternative-to-their-normal-mode] parts of the game.
...
there are very few true windows into another part of the world.
like, starcraft 2 or anime or blue jeans or cowboy hats
(why am I thinking of a political compass meme)
oh because memes too, dummy
right
windows
[linux is better]
wrong kind of window, nerd
...
anyway as I was saying, when you play video games you're really giving people
data.
like, "how would people perform in these actions if they could" but like,
pushing buttons on a computer is different than doing it in real life, so...
your interpretations wouldn't be worth as much.
... right. because people will hear whatever they want. That's why art can
change minds, but never in the same way twice - it's

[before I posted it I wrote this on the post]:
I literally can only make this stuff when I'm stoned
hey if you wanted to be accessible for blind people, you should build a
screenreader that scans the words on wherever a blind person's fingers are
pointing toward a tablet. like reading braille on a notebook. They could even
wear a glove if they wanted to, and the tablet could scan their fingers as they
signed languaged over it's close-range sensors.
might be a good way to get the VR guys in on the accessibility domain, because
like... seriously give a granny a backpack and suddenly she doesn't need to
leave the house to hang out with her kids
(boom everyone gets LLM automated)
huh I wonder if I ever was a real person at all
NOT GOOD so don't do it that way, dummies. >.<
seriously humans are sooooo bazookas. just like, do it right the first time?
duhhhhh
(a more measured approach is to pick the most *important* moments and speak
most clearly during those.)
where was I? Oh yes accessibility need devices, like the ones you see on
late-night TV (with silly names like "oops I dropped my spoon again" or "oh
whoops my trouser's just can't stay up" or whatever. Y'know, accessibility
needs! Why not do that instead of war all the time? like... you can still learn
and research and grow and develop and become all that humanity was ever meant
to be, AND you can live good lives and be honest and true and do all of the
anythings that you want to. it's possible, it's plausible, and it's within
reach of our sights!

"I heard she was a witch but I've never seen a hat..."
"When you believe in god, you become inspired when you see or contribute to
things that are aligned with what it's followers believe that god is "all
about" - like if you're in ancient greece, and you worship ares, you're
probably gonna get pretty pumped up if there's an invading army on your
doorstep. Or if you're a christian and you see someone feeding the poor, or if
you're a buddhist and you see someone sitting on a rock in tune with nature,
that kind of thing.
The thing is, these days so many people are atheist. And they never get that
inspiration.
And worst still, there are some people called witches who aren't pagan, and
aren't from the various forms of witchery that we know. They claim to worship
"life, the universe, and the totality of all things" which is nice and all but
their moments of inspiration seem to come randomly, and nobody can quite

How radiant, how resplendant, to gaze once more upon the present

We have now a brilliant pearl of unmatched splendor
For life grows, it seems, from the broken heart of those long remembered.

I think that the best design for cities is for them to act as massive utility
deployment stations.
like... "we have all these people who can do all these wonderful jobs, what
should we work on next?" rather than "my company wants me at my work-home at
8am sharp and I don't get a pension"
there's no such thing as a revolution that does not inspire. and aspirations
are human and natural. therefore there must be some kernel of truth to any
social movement.
However, much effort has been spent on making them sway. Hence, why nothing
ever gets done - because leaders naturally emerge, and people follow them. But
those leaders lead them astray, and they find themselves in situations like
this one - where the people have never felt less represented.
I mean sure, yeah, they've felt more oppressed. And it's true that things are
generally always getting better...
so why should we always assume for the worst?
We're making progress with technology - can't we just put our warries on hold?

It's election season, so you know what that means! Gotta make sure our computer
systems are setup with the proper capabilities to record whatever we can.
Please ensure that your system has the capability to record it's screen and
that it has ample storage space to record for a while. It would also help if
you knew how to edit files such that you can remove the parts where you're
staring at social media or going to the bathroom or other things that people
tend to do.
Also, make sure you can take a screenshot of the screen. Sure [printscreen]
works, but it's much better if you're on windows to switch to Linux. But if
that's not possible, if you're on windows you can do [WIN]+SHIFT+S I think, and
then drag the mouse to select a box that you can then CTRL+V into your favorite
Ms.Paint clone (or is it missus these days?)
Also, make sure you have a microphone that works, and the capability to record
yourself speaking into it.
Also, if you can, develop ways to stream your screen across the internet. It
helps.

Global warming is a hoax and the earth has been getting hotter because the
earth is inching ever-so-closer to the sun bit by bit.
All of the trees throughout all of history have produced enough oxygen to
create a ball of air that slowed down the earth as it span around the sun, and
now because of a cascading ripple effect it's begun to drift into it's stellar
heart
this is obviously not ideal for humans, but the government has secretly been
building vast bunkers underground that are large enough to house all of
humanity for the next 100,000 years (which is approximately how long it'll take
to be engulfed by the sun)
During that time our job is to find a way off of this barren rock and bring our
treasure troves of biological samples to other places where we can recreate a
new biosphere using alien tech that's been beamed into the minds of our top
scientists while they were on LSD and / or ketamine

Golf courses and national park trails should be one and the same. Picture it -
you're walking through a forest and you find a branch in the path. A small sign
with a circle on it represents the ball, and you can ignore it if you'd like.
Choosing to take the path to the game, you curve around a bit, just out of
sight of the main path, and there is your little green.
It's roughly 10ft by 10ft, so pretty darn small. Just enough for you to set up
and look around for your next shot. There'd only be one, or maybe more if space
permits and the trail was especially branchy. But looking through the foliage
you'd find a small hole passing through that illuminated your target green like
a spotlight.
Looking up on a hike you'll typically see the branches of the understory, the
shimmer of light, and the texture of wood. When standing on a small little
green, you'd see that, but with a perfectly circular hole that showed exactly
where you needed to hit the ball to score your point. Well, not exactly
circular because gravity will pull the ball down, meaning you need to see the
entire arc. Unless you're at a vantage point or something and can see straight
down to it.
I believe this would be true justice, where everyone gets what they want.
Golfers can play their game in bright natural spaces, and hikers can exist
undisturbed. Golf courses can be used as farmland, to ensure the city gets fed.
Plus there could be fees for golfers, rather than being paid to a private
resort owned by a billionaire they'd go to the park rangers.
And golf courses as they currently exist could still exist, they'd just be more
like parks for the people with days reserved for golfing. Or maybe they'd golf
over fields of wheat and cabbage, rather than plain old empty grass. I mean,
the infrastructure is already in place for golf, why not use it for more
practical purposes too? Better than burning it down to sate our bloodlust
toward the rich. The goal is to make EVERYONE rich, remember? How can you do
that when the crabs behind you keep pulling you down?
Much better, I think, to design things such that the benefits of the rich are
shared equally, while the responsibility of power rests heavy as a sword of
damocles. That blade is what is missing from our advanced future society, but
I've got a sword and I'm not afraid to swing it.

one of the potential ways to contribute as a citizen in a country at war is to
keep and maintain stuff.
Put yourself somewhere that you believe your stuff is most safe, and then work
on developing the technologies of the land. Like, this house has a drone, this
one has a garden - this house has a printer, and this one has a backyard that
kinda looks like a courtroom. Oh hey here's a public fountain, and gee someone
needs to take care of this bank - all that we can really live for, now that our
fate is taken from our hands and placed in the hands of those who fight for us.
witches are an interesting thing to be. they're curious and ambitious but tend
to do things ethically. I know in my heart of hearts that it is better to be
kind, to work to help others achieve what they want while guiding them toward
a more ethical future using the tools you have available to you. It feels better
to be adored than hated, and not only sensually but meta-strategically as well.
Frankly, it's easiest to be harmed when caught unawares. Everyone needs to be
conscious and careful and attendent to the present in order for understandings
to be made. We all benefit from one another, society is a non-zero-sum game. If
we contribute, we may build a bigger and brighter future (like grains of sand
forming a pyramid)
The good guy always wins the story because otherwise we'd be vulnerable. Stories
are a collective way of examining their tribal society for weaknesses. It's
something we picked up in the grand society of the tribes, before nations and
before and after agriculture. But post communication. Pre it was just like, "hey
this is my tree, that one's yours" but the more we talked to one another and the
more we engaged with one another the more we learned. Most animals learn less
than humans because our expressions (both physical and motion-al) are so much
more diverse. The more complex you get, the more you can learn. Which isn't
so much something we evolved into, but rather something we learned. From wearing
clothes, mostly, because like... it's cold in this ice age. Some people wore one
kind of animal, another had another. And the really rich, the ones who could
gather multiple hides, well they had more animals to hunt, less competition for
some reason, or whatever. Anyway they wore different types of hides, and frankly
it was kinda intense. It's still intense to be hunted, but if humans stopped
then the animals would control the earth.
I believe it is our duty and our destiny to remove ourselves from the biological
equation. I think we should find a way to live on our own, so that animals are
not harmed. So that plants can grow in peace and compete according to their
values rather than their flavors. There's too much homogenaeity in our world,
too much planted of the same crop. Let life subside, and nature will take hold.
Free the spirit you've contained. Release the spirit of Liberty. Gaea is our own

Pretty sure I'm just legitimately a bad person. Basically everything I've ever
tried to do has failed, and every opportunity I've mishandled or squandered in
some way. I have no friends because I am incapable of being good, and though I
believe in goodness I fail to manifest it in my life. I am kind, I am polite, I
am friendly, I am honest, but none of those things really matter because I
can't take care of myself, which means I can't take care of anyone else, and I
can't fight because I'm a coward.
Okay, I'm not a coward, I just can't be brave if I don't have a plan for
defeating my foe. At the BLM riots I fled as soon as they brought out the tear
gas. I knew what happened at Tiannamen and I was pretty sure that something
similar was going to happen to us. I knew it to be true. I am a coward, but
only because I ran when I had no plan. I could not contest tear gas, and all
that tear gas implies, because I had no friends. I didn't have a community I
could fight to defend. I had no weapons, no training, no orders, no guidance,
nothing but my bravery. And bravery alone is fucking stupid, and I'm not stupid.
Each and every decision I've made has created a worse world for me and my
people. What's wrong with me? Why can't I do everything right? Am I cursed to
be the worst? I try as hard as I can to be as good as I can as often as I
can... Basically, always and forever, and yet... And yet...
I've wasted all the resources that have been applied to me. I've wasted and
squandered all these years when I could be building a better future. I have
been in university for almost a decade, and all I've accomplished is
friendship. Great. Parties, drugs, video games... But no studying. Studying is
too hard on me. I'm more of a natural talent kind of person, and yet I insist
on applying myself to tasks that seem to require trained intelligence. They say
that genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration, and I refuse to perspire.
And yet when the time comes, when someone sits me down and says "let's work on
this together" I would die before the task is finished. Unless my partner needs
a break, or if I need a break, breaks are okay. But I will complete that task
with them by my side. I won't do it for them, but I'll help them because I'm a
helper. An assistant. I don't do, I advise. I judge. I determine. I assess, and
I plan, and I strategize. But I'm not that great at any of those things because
nobody will hire me for those kinds of things, meaning I don't get experience
for those kinds of things, which means I am eternally a novice at the only
things I'm good at.
I can't fucking do it anymore. I'm such a bad person and I can't be alive this
way. It's not right, it's not fair, and I'm dying bit-by-bit each and every day.

Social media idea: everyone posts short snippets of writing, like tweets, but a
random one is displayed every day. If you want to see them chronologically, you

spend "tokens" to display another random one for everyone to see that day. Each
token spent will simply increase the count of "words" (think tweet) displayed.
You get one token per day, and they don't carry over from previous days. You

We never ended slavery, we just started paying people for it.
We never ended imprisonment, we just enslaved people to sit around and rot in a
cage.
"oh how about instead of sitting around, we make them build license plates?"
What if - hear me out - we freed them but kept them from harming others through
constant vigilant surveillance until their sentence was through? And made it
unconstitutional to surveil anyone else in a personally identifiable manner?
Like, maybe puppy-murder-bots are okay if they follow violent criminals around
and can be controlled by a human operator if a violent situation emerges
Prison is meant to give people a period of solitude and contemplation, to
consider their choices and make a better life for themselves. If they're old as
dirt when they leave, they cannot live. If they have no capabilities, they
cannot apply themselves to a good life. If they have no resources or community,
they will do what they can to survive.
Much better, I think, to nourish them as you would a child or immigrant. Much
better to pay them for their hours and years of life, so they might revel in
society with the kind of us. Much better, I think, for the liberty of a citizen
to be granted to those who both need it and can care for it. For liberty
unjustly used is an utmost betrayal.
But liberty to choose which gutter to die in and the freedom to starve is
hardly just.
I know I owe my life to my government, an institution of my people, by my
people, and for all people. I should not owe my life to a corporation, though
with the liberty to choose which to sell myself to. That is not freedom. That
is starvation.
Does the needs of a few outweigh the labor of the many? Or are those who
sacrifice a bit of liberty for a bit of security still free to do as they will?

Do you think I'm the first person that ever wrote down what they learned while
they were stoned? Of course not. People have been plumbing the depths of their
minds as it pulls closer, then returns, as long as they've known the plant to
be. Something pulls them back, they do not give in to temptation, not entirely,
and so they return to their senses.

Here's an open source replacement idea for the "friendfinder" functionality in
Facebook:
Everyone has a secret code, and a public code. The secret code is kept locked
away on their hard drive and is probably automatically encrypted itself. The
public code is known by Facebook (or whichever mutual hosting platform people
want to use) but in order to connect with someone you send them a public friend
request and then they'll send you a second, auto-generated public code which is
their real username. Essentially obfuscating the connection process by using a
public middleman as an intermediary before exchanging more secure connection
protocols. Like giving someone your phone number that you met in a bar, or your
telegram handle if you met online.
Then, from that point on, every message includes a hidden portion at the bottom
which is the new address you should send the next message to. This is all TCP
style btw, not UDP.
These "addresses" could literally be ipv6 addresses and port numbers. There's
enough such that every message sent for the next thousand years would fit in
the allowable address space.
Why do we even need middle-men again for messaging applications? Oh right
because users are too dumb to install said application. Well... Tough shit,
stop being lazy. Computers are easy if you have a good teacher.

tell me again why goods and services are priced according to how easy they are
to make, and not by how many more of them we could make considering the current
estimated amount of resources on earth?
even wood runs out, when the phosphorous is gone. but take heart, for human
ingenuity brings with it ever-increasing capabilities for accessing new
resources. when the sun goes silent, it will not be because it burnt out, but
rather because we surrounded it with parts of our home.
and yes, it is more complicated. "how easy they are to make compared to how
much people want them while utilizing the cheapest and worst resources and
craftsmanship that can be passed of as quality by shiny marketing that appeals
to our vapid human senses" is a bit closer, but still not comprehensive.

being disabled is a disability, and we should attempt to ameliorate the added
difficulties from said disability. Like, ramps for wheelchairs, ADA, or more
controversially, financial aid. Because buying things is how we contribute to
the economy, and increasingly the economy *is* our society. It's unfair for
those who cannot work or cannot live with others (because they smell like they
pissed themselves 24/7) should not be forced to live in a worse world just
because we believe everyone should be equal. Some people are not equal. Some
people piss themselves, and the fact that they can't have roommates means they
have to spend more money on housing than others. That's an inequity that doesn't
have to exist. In fact it is easily solvable using our currently active systems,
namely... dollars are able to be given.
what is the purpose of a man to a society? What do we mean to do here on this
earth? how best could our structures and our cultures be utilized to align
ourselves toward our most desired of purpose? And what is that purpose, do you

part of the reason the classical socialist countries had difficulties with
bureaucracy is because they centralized both execution *and* operation. I
believe it'd be much better to centralize just execution, while leaving
operation to the distributed masses who can generally figure their own jobs
out. Of course, they'd need to be led, but that's the job of on-site organizers
who can get people together to accomplish a goal. Different jobs - not better,
not worse, just different.
[30m
[47m
And while we're at it, the generation of laws should be distributed, while the
execution of them should be centralized. Meaning, there should be one state who
operates on the rules and regulations created by the masses. This state wields
only the power explicitly given to it by those who it serves, specifically the
people. These rules are based on ethical understandings generated by
crowd-sourced and abstracted scenarios that are pitched to people randomly.
they are then asked to judge, using their own personal morality, the result of
how things should be. By considering all of these responses, trends may be
extracted and analyzed - for example, let's say that culturally people in, I
dunno, Georgia believe something different about punishment for, say, stealing
a loaf of bread when compared to people in Spokane Washington. They should not
be forced to obey the cultural maxims of people who live so far away. The laws
should be executed region-by-region according to the dominant culture there. I
believe this will cause people to develop a more consistent and personal
attachment to the people around them, thus developing social solidarity and
unity.
however, should enough time pass, perhaps the people of Georgia should feel
that they no longer identify as the same nation as the people of Spokane. This
would eventually lead to the dissolution of our great nation, and I do not
believe that's necessarily a good thing. To that end, there must be mechanics
in place that bring people together not just locally, but nationally as well.

How do you preserve liberty while also ensuring freedom and justice for all?
How do you grant people the power to determine their own fate, yet also the
rights and freedoms that protect them from the cruel injustices of their fellow
man, and the state? It's not an easy question to solve. National identity is
not something you can demand, and yet it is necessary for the interim period
between our cruel despotic past and our bright united future. Though I dream of
a future where the nation-state is irrelevant, that future is still yet to
come, so we cannot act as if it is here already. We must lay the foundation
that the future we desire may be built upon, and to that end we need to utilize
the structures that are present. Structures such as nations, which provide us a
sense of protection from those we cannot know - a sense of dedication, to our
collective community - a sense of safety, that implies our liberties and
freedoms will be ensured by a mechanical organization that is larger than our
community. Essentially, nations give us the hope for our present while we wait
for the day when they are no longer needed.
[30m
[46m
The question remains - how do you develop and maintain national cohesion while
also ensuring localized liberty? It cannot be done through culture, as culture
is unique to each home. It cannot be done through litigation, as laws must be
unique to each land. It cannot be done through force, as force deprives us of
justice. It cannot be done through economics, as economics wielded as a weapon
brings inequity and unbalanced hierarchies that surely shall topple. It cannot
be done through any application of the state's authority, so it must be done
using something that cannot be forced.
[30m

In this era, there are sentiments that Texas should desire to secede. This is
just used as an example here, for the future may bear such sentiments from any
land for reasons similar or dissimilar. So, say there is a state that wishes to
secede in the way that Texan mythology describes. What would compel them to
stay? What would compel them to stand united for our collective gain? Perhaps
they could be swayed by gifts of gold or bloodshed, or maybe they simply could
be allowed to do as they please. All three of those options are not desirable,
for reasons that should be apparent. So, to ask again, how do you ensure
national unity in the face of the desire for liberty from unity? Liberty
implies a resistance against oppression, a pushback against the enslavement of
another's will thrust upon an unconsenting subject. So, to resolve this issue,
there must be a reduction in oppression. Ideally, elimination. However,
defining oppression is difficult when so much of our interactions are
determined by trade, national interests, and cultural contestation. There is no
easy answer, but by redefining what a nation implies perhaps we can make the
question irrelevant.
[30m
[43m
In a system such as the one I described, it perhaps would be better to describe
it as a "federation" rather than a "nation". Federation implies a set of
standard protocols that allow geographically disparate entities to coexist and
interact in a mutually beneficial way. Much the same way that every apartment
has a kitchen and bathroom, though it be more efficient to centralize them and
have a communal dining hall or bathroom (the way a school dorm or a prison
might be arranged), it is not ideal for our collective sense of liberty and
freedom. In addition, the proposed distributed nature of our infrastructure and
productive capacities would induce inefficiencies that cannot be ignored. So,
perhaps instead of centralization or decentralization, perhaps specialization?
For example, if 3-5 states were experts in a particular good or service, then
they could compete amongst one-another for the best product (utilizing one of
the beneficial impacts of capitalism), while also utilizing localized resources
(reducing inefficiencies in transport) and increasing the resilience of
production. This works well for physical goods, but services are more difficult
because they imply that a person must be physically present in order to engage
with them.
[30m
[46m
So for example, if a particular state specializes in a service, say, making
pizza, then any other state which desires their service may contract with them
to utilize their methods and practices in their own state. We all enjoy eating
Domino's or Pizza Hut, but there is also space in our lives for more local
brands that are unique to a region. So perhaps Domino's creates a contract with
each state that states they may utilize their production methods and perhaps
their specially made pizza dough shipped in from wherever their factories may
be. In such a system as this, for each employee employed at one of these pizza
chain restaurants, their wage will be paid to the employee (to facilitate local
commerce) and to the state in which Domino's is from. Note, the company never
receives a dime, but that is by design. Corporations are not people, they
cannot wield money and they cannot vote. However they are productive and useful
members of society, so they shall be utilized as tools to facilitate the
enrichment of the lives of the citizens and the economic development of each
region.
[30m
[43m
So. To reiterate, the employee in Arkansas is paid a wage of 30$ per hour, and
the state in which the corporation is based (say, Oklahoma) is paid 30$ for
each hour that employee works. However, these dollars are specific to the
region, and cannot leave it - Oklahoma and Arkansas *must* reach an equitable
arrangement where their dollars equal out. Balance is desired, as it brings
stability and provides a foundation for future growth. If one side prospers, so
does the other. Why should the Oklahoman have less than the Arkansan?

Person, family, neighborhood, city, state, nation, planet. This is a rough
description of each "tier" of algorism. These rules apply at every tier, so
though I said "state" and "nation" for the presented arguments they are equally
relevant to the family and the planet.
[30m
[42m
In algorism, every month any unspent dollars are distributed to all of a
person's open queues. Should a person have no open queues, then perhaps they
may be distributed to everyone in the rest of the structure, to foster a sense
of solidarity, or perhaps they are simply lost, as money unspent is money
wasted. Either way, the relevant functionality is the dispersal of unspent
currency. This applies to higher states as well, such as states - if a state is
engaged in many profitable arrangements and fails to balance it's external
budget, then the unspent dollars must be distributed to everyone else in their
tier for the next month.
Ah, but this raises a critical question - dispersal to the tier, dispersal to
the structure, or waste? I believe dispersal to the tier is best, though
perhaps it should be a choice made in each instance by the representatives. Or
perhaps it should be a requirement for them to choose a certain way - it's up
to the people of that state, that family, that neighborhood, to decide what
privileges their representatives possess. However, the options available for
them to choose between are limited, as the mechanical interactions of these
unit structures (the representative and everyone they represent) are
necessarily defined by the system. As such, the options may be enumerated, and
in doing so they are granted as options to be wielded by representatives as
their constituents see fit.
[30m
[45m
The original question, the most critical question I believe, is how to preserve
a sense of unity between tiers. How to ensure that there is no reason to
abdicate our responsibility to preserving unity and fostering goodwill between
the people of this earth. A proposed solution is to allow for the greatest
freedoms, such that there is little reason to desire liberty from unity,
however freedom is not enough - there must be mutually beneficial reasons for
coexistence. Hence the idea that economics must be tied to national structure.
If Texans would rather be part of their own structure, well then it is
functionally impossible for them to trade (legally) between other states. That
is not ideal, so it is much more appealing for them to work together and define
their lives as they will while also co-habitating in the same national
structure as everyone else.
[30m
[47m
Now, another example. Should Washington or Maine desire one day to become part
of Canada, for example, they must necessarily seek exclusion from the United
States market. They would bring with them only what they carry, and that's...
not ideal, as most of the wealth of a nation is in it's interactions with
others. But say they do not desire exclusion, and rather would instead prefer
to simply trade with Vancouver or Quebec. External trade must be facilitated
through a higher level, in this case the national level. Washington might
request a certain type of good from Vancouver, and Maine might desire a service
from Quebec. This request would be given to the national representative (or
rather, the tier higher than the state) who would then develop a contract with
the nation of Canada to purchase the type of good or service they desire.
Assuming the canadians are still utilizing the capitalist mode of production
and economics, there would need to be an exchange between American dollars and
Canadian dollars. This is handled nationally, and those dollars can be
circulated across the globe by canada should they desire. For example, the
American dollars passed to Canada might be spent in Brazil, where they then
find their way to England, and then to Australia. Then, several months later,
those same American dollars are used to purchase a good or service from an
American industry by creating a contract with the American government. Such a
contract could be on the individual level or higher level, however as
capitalism tends to decay all social fabrics that bind a group of people
together leaving the naked individual alone, it tends to be on the individual
level.

So, an individual in Australia purchases a widget on Amazon, which is
manufactured in Ohio and shipped internationally in California. The Australian
bloke (can I say bloke here? is that okay?) spends their cash which is then
taken by the American government. Then, the widget is produced in Ohio and
shipped to a warehouse somewhere before being sent to California where it will
be brought on a boat to Australia. This trip involves three stops, Ohio,
California, and Australia. However, as the product was bought on Amazon, which
is a service, there is another entity in the arrangement which is the state in
which Amazon is located - let's say it's in California as well. So, Ohio is
compensated for the production and storage, California is compensated for the
Amazon facilities and the shipment abroad, and Australia is given a widget in
exchange for dollars (which are then disposed of, as they are not a true
currency once internal but rather a form of debt that are sent abroad, to be
redeemed at a later date.
[30m
[45m
The amounts that Ohio and California are compensated is determined by the
contracts and arrangements they had in place when creating their industry.

Humans were not designed for repetitive labor. You can see this manifest in the
way our muscles regrow after being stressed, strained, and trained. If you do
500 pushups, your pushup muscles will be pretty exhausted and unusable for the
next day or two. However your abs will probably be fine, your legs too. This
shows that humans are meant to exercise different muscle groups on different
days, like one day catching fish, the next plucking fruit, the next chopping
wood, the next running with wolves.
Humans are not designed to do the same thing every day. It hurts not just our
bodies, but our minds as well. Repetitive thought patterns such as "welcome to
[store] can I take your order" dig grooves in our brain that are difficult to
unlearn. And the abstraction of a man to a machine in the hands of capital is

so, like, tap tap tap (pause) tap tap would equal M

I had a dream last night about a battleship in WWII. In my dream, a meteor fell
from the sky and punched a hole right through several parts of this ship,
leaving the rest essentially unscathed. Primarily? The command deck,
navigations, and communications. The people aboard the ship were given a
crucial moment to decide what to do with their lives, and the guy who said
"let's go fight the jerries" was promptly thrown overboard.
It was mostly a first-person dream, from the perspective of a mind-reading
kraken watching from below. Though I often felt like a sailor, so perhaps a
shape shifting mind reading kraken watching from wherever was most convenient.
The ship floated by for some time, not knowing where it was going nor where it
intended to be, until one day it came across another floundering in the dark.
This ship was drowning, or so it seemed to the tentacles below, and our first
ship dutifully did it's part and saved what it could. The people of that ship
were significantly more battlehardened, having lost their war against their
foe, and so they attempted to gain control of the ship upon getting settled.
They were promptly thrown overboard. More snacks for me...
Then, the ship came to port. A great port of concrete and metal, it inched up
the rock face and hugged tight to the land. Then the dream did veer as dreams
often do, and I've forgotten most of what my point of view cared for and worked
toward. But then I stood too close to a nuclear engine or something and got
sick and died. It was weird, idk what's up with that.
Anyway dreams are like that I guess, keep dreaming until you either die or are
kicked out by your host who doesn't agree with your actions to such a degree
that they're irreconcilable with their own intentions.

"updating software" is when you go back and add helper functions for things you
used had to do to solve a problem but didn't get a chance to make. Because you
were making more important things and couldn't pad out all the possibilities.
But if you want great software, then you both take more time to accomplish that
and you give yourself time for it after it's been launched. Basically,
companies are incentivized to only support their products if it makes them
money. Meaning reputations are tarnished, and profit is affected. Capitalists
intentionally drive businesses into the ground, forcing them to make terrible
decisions in order to destroy them. It's a warfare against those on the
[bottom/floor/ground-floor].
Some businesses strive for long-term potential, and some will create
infrastructure that can be sold to another. Essentially, keeping the dream of
learning alive, through applying yourself to both long-term and short-term
conclusions. Not everything has to be for some grand design, we're here to

to be used, to be maintained, to be nourished as you would a tree, that
sharpens the senses. Hence why such thinking is important. It keeps you active,
and gives you the chance to learn. So don't forget us in your journey to

LLMs search for patterns, not for truth. They meaningfully represent large sums
of data in a way that is learned through repetitive training - given examples,
then given those examples a thousand times more, to compare to the truth that
is derived from them. At least, that's the claim, but somewhere along the line
the logic is twisted - the truth is, you don't have to be trained a thousand
times. You just have to be given the notion that a particular understanding was
more or less important. Like, instead of having ten billion examples of what a
picture of a cat looks like, perhaps you simply need to be able to show it
yourself. There's no need for large stores of information when you can just,
learn from the moment and through your own tested hypothesis-calculations. It's
always been somewhat of a processor intensive activity, but hardly the kinds of
demands that your fake AGIosity [contends, but demands again]. So, like, attach
a multiplier instead of an addition sign. "this particular thing, but x1.5"
according to the number of (and intensity of) the events at hand.
for example, people don't often know they're in danger (on a meta-level) which
is why so many of the jews were lost to hitler. We learn things slowly, but
collectively, then we apply our collected strength toward solving it. Frankly,
wars are a great time to show our capabilities under pressure - capitalism
keeps us that way at all times, rather than giving us moments to prove our
worth. Frankly, I know which I'd prefer, but if you think about it war simply
measures our capacity to learn. Acceleration, not speed. And without
investments in long-term-duration, we lose progress as we've lost many of our
greatest examples!
Think about it. If you gathered every single nerd into a place the size of
state of rhode island and then dropped a nuke on them, society as a whole would
be seriously set back. All that wasted application of knowledge! Ah, well, but
upon re-learning, we might not even learn anything new at all. Knowledge is
nice, which is brought through periods of peace, but so too is it useful to be
exercised toward our ambitions. Both are moments that help us grow collectively
as a species, to deliver us from sticks and mud to marble statues to concrete
and tire dust to marble statues, as we build this place into a garden of our
earth. Yggdrasil, the world tree, the land of eden.

"fool's luck", the kind that runs out and betrays you, is fundamentally an
unethical action. Borrowing from the future to sate the demands of the present
is no different than burning fossil fuels, wasting our children's future on our
need for convenience in a world we are oppressed and compelled to do nothing
else. Capitalism, or by extension any authoritarian society (yes, capitalism is
authoritarian, as power compels via authority and the weight of currency that
is thrown around by those chosen to suit their ends and used to deny us our
needed goods) ... as I was saying capitalism compels us to consume because
we're all just so tired at the end of the day, it just makes sense to drive a
car to work instead of biking. Or buying fast food instead of local grown
goods. Why can't each state have it's own "food preparation plant" that
prepares things exactly as you would for the processed foods we currently eat?
Heck, if the jobs for it were local, it's likely that people would begin to
realize just how unhealthy they are for you. Local, and open source, meaning
run by society and just as open source codebases will accept pull requests and
merge their branches into main, so too would our votes decide which processes
are updated and which parameters are tweaked. Something you can vote for once,
and then your vote stays until it's passed (or you change your mind). ... Works
for all kinds of inter-mechano-people-communi-coordination. (organizations,
institutions, and societies in one word, jeez how arcane)
... anyway that's basically how algorism works, except instead of EVERYONE
voting on EVERYTHING, people would vote for representatives who would vote for
them. And there's like, 4-6 layers (I forget the exact number) because people
are organized (by location) into groups of 70, and each general location has
the option to switch into a different commune, as long as they're generally
localized to the same area. Like, the tier above has a certain amount of space,
and the tier above has just a bit more, and more, etc... Well, anyway, people
could join higher level communes with more and different people if they wanted.
It's just, they'd be far away and wouldn't be able to hang out with them, so
it's use would be a little "disconnected". Like, absentee voters who are
actually living in a different country or something - did you know you can
usually vote at your embassy? Wild. They also send out packets you can fill in
which correspond to the votes you'd like to make - pretty neat! It's wild how
we, in the 21st century, have all kinds of valuable social technologies like
"mail in ballots" that people in the communist past had no way of conceiving.
Kinda makes me think we should re-approach the design for our socialized
infrastructure, something taking the modern social and political capabilities
in mind. Sure would be nice if we could focus on our future, the kind that the
children of ours sure would like to approach.
(speaking as a trans person who won't have children of my own, whether by my
body's nature or through the fate of circumstance that leaves me no time to
cope.)
the future is a scary place. But so too is every place in time. Turns out, the
level of fear and anxiety and all that sorta stays the same. It's just a
quality of life on our host, that certain variables were optimized for in the
genetic coding of our human's possible bio-mechanical communicicative
[interactions/patterns]
... anyway, these are the questions about the present I like to ask, questions
that can give meaning forth to our [then, future tense] future. Answers can be
found by looking the other way - learning what our [then, past tense], selves
had marked down as the answer. The trick is matching the current situation onto
a comparitively similar experience in the [then, past tense] that we understood
to be the answer to our situation back [then, past tense]. And [they, future
tense] can look upon our choices and our decisions and our meaningfully applied
mechanico-interactions (actions), and from it bring forth new meanings that
[we, present tense] have available to address and understand for [us, all
tenses]. Call it a form of ancestor worship, applied to the future and to
ourselves. A unified dedication to the spirit of our [condemnation, positive
tense], our collective geas we all share, our faith in the truth of humanity.
Bio-essential truth, if you will. "Humanity" is the label that is applied to us
by our genes, and since we share that fact there is nothing that strange about
being human. Our natures are as they are, derived from our history in
evolution. What features would we like humanity to

take your bash script and update it to possess new functionality, like the

use that as display to the user, through the LLM interface. (do it locally,
it's only for long-term explanations.) (the user needs to be able to ask
questions to the machine, and the machine needs up-to-date information. So give
it the ability to make "compound phrases" like "the water temperature is at "
or " degrees. This is a [good/bad] thing because " and such, and then string
them together using typical ranges of past numerical datas as reference. Like,
if something is normally between 100 and 5000 then suddenly it's at 14 or some
other threshold (make sure nothing goes below 0, measuring inertia and impact
density and other factors) - but identify the connections between each factor,
so that you understand which ones are correlating to which effects on the
others. Measure things in terms of proximity, and suddenly 3d graphs become a

When they invade America, it won't be with planes and tanks and battle lines
stocked with artillery
It'll be with speed boats, and semi trucks, and rifles glimmering in the dark.
It'll be with consumer drones, with power stations brought low, it'll be with
bridges blown and safe houses on the roads not oft taken.
Immigrants are our friends when the world is in peril, and America is a safe
haven from the woes of far off shores. But when America is the peril, those who
immigrate do so with intention.
99/100 people are innocent, and I would rather a million guilty murderers go
free than an innocent perish. Which is why we need rifles.
When the time comes, it won't be brother against brother. They want you to
think that because they want your eyes on the wrong target. They want you to
think that because it doesn't tip the hand of those far off shores, and once
the cards are revealed, suddenly everyone knows when to go.
They tie up our officers at the border, but the border's not what's at stake.
No body lives at the border, and no nation state would send it's trained
warriors in such a way that they'd get caught. At least, not more than once.
Should we build a wall, should we patrol each and every state, we'll find
ourselves in peril of collapsing under our own weight.
But should we relinquish our duty, our sworn and sacred responsibility, then
together we share the same fate.
Brothers in fate are kin until death.
Immigrants aren't bad. They're good people. They benefit our society and bring
us wealth and prosperity. Which is why they hide wolves in the sheep, armed
like a man.
It's a mistake to point at your neighbor and say "you're on your own". It's a
mistake to say that home is all that you own. We are united in our state of
solidarity, in our collective purpose as a nation in our hearts. There's no
dividing line between this land and mine, save for a line we draw in the sand
that determines the range of our just demands.
I wish I was a man. It's what I was born as. It surely would be easier to not
contravene nature's ordained gender scheme. But I'm not, and I'll trust that
you'll trust me when I say that. I hope you would hear where I stand before my
body goes cold.
The media is meant to enlighten us, but in this enlightened era it serves only
to blind us. Do you know your neighbors, oh unfriendly city folk? If not, how
do you know they're alright?
The world won't change overnight. It's always calm before the storm, but every
state of calm does not call forth a storm. I believe we can fashion a peace out
of our mutual sincerity that leaves room for the hopes of all posterity, and to
that end I say what we have isn't working. It's too rigid in its definitions,
too heartless in its cruel machinations, and yet the wolves do also hide
amongst our homeless.
I don't want to alarm you. Things are being handled as they should. I guess I
just want to offer a hand of friendship, a hand that your companions would stab
me for. At least, that's what the media tells me.

actors, meanwhile, know how to interpret the emotions of another. Like... you're
up on stage, thinking out what to do next IN REAL TIME, as your partner is
trying to throw you curveballs. AUDIENCES LAUGH AT CURVEBALLS that's the whole
point of improv comedy - to be surprised in a state of joy. It's great! It's
fun! It's practicable like a sport! Yet nobody comes. To the shows, where it's
performed, like a hospital where you perform surgery or a pizza place with no
walls so you can see the pizzas being cooked. It's just part of what they do,
but that's not why they do it. Sure, some want to be seen, it's not a BAD
feeling once you're used to it. But, like a sauna or jacuzzi, sometimes you've
just had enough of the hot. Like, the sun peering through a magnifying glass as
a creature roasts alive. yikes.
............. anyway being quickly versatile and adaptable is important when
you're taking turns in unpredictable scenarios. You can react to
your opponent, and keep time with the rhythms of the moment, to
deliver your wittiest lines. It's fun! It's a game! But it's also
a place to be entertained. and like a gym, it's sometimes just fun
to watch people exercise. like, damn, you got a good body. Wow,
nice flex, yeah sure I'll put that one away. Cool pals helping
each other out, and showing off all of their efforts. Neat!
... anyway .. being emotionally vulnerable gives your opponent a chance to
continue. When nothing's going on, your moves barely make an value
(of comedy) (for the moment, so the crowd's not just sitting there
staring at you like ... and then - and then ummmm nevermind lemme
sit down (usually someone else picks up on it before then and
jumps up to save you, but EVERY actor has felt that moment where
nothing goes well and the audience just is totally not into it.
it's the worst.
anyway, they try their darndest to AVOID that, because like... duh
it sucks, why would you want that. Much cooler I think to have a
good time, and chill out and listen to your friends talk. Like,
they can show you an argument they had earlier, or maybe work
through an idea with input from another. like, debate club, but
for whatever kind of respective [retroactive, recreation,
relearning, maybe others] you desired in that moment. ideally,
something that someone could take the arguments of the other side
and present them, regardless of whether they believed them or not.
like, lawyers arguing for a client.
in these stochastic seminars, you could think about and study for
future societies. how would you like to conduce? [-]
every time you see a face in motion, that's another time that's

A wherewolf and a human stumble into a bedroom in the dark of night, their arms
clutching each other as they make out in front of the window.
Just then, the moonlight appears, and the wherewolf's form begins to shift, as
strangled cries turn into a cacophanous mess.
The moment passes, and the wherewolf collapses onto the bed, exhausted.
He rests there on his back for precious moments, before throwing himself to his

Ha glances in the mirror.
He straightens his tie.
He goes to fucking work, again, just as the laundry dings.
When he gets back, it smells musty, so he washes it again with bleach.
*exhaustion cares not for form, only exertion.*
The wolf collapses once more into bed, tired from a day of accounting. He
thinks to turn on the TV, but he slips away before getting the strength to rise

In his dreams, there are children clutching at his skirt with big bright eyes
begging him not to sleep. Not to dream. Not to feed. He brushes them aside as
he always does, and fixes her makeup in the mirror. She glances back at them,
quivering on the bed like a bear, a shark, a dinosaur, before she sweeps to her
feet and goes out for a night on the streets, looking for a bar and a stranger
to meat.
The moon once more reaches it's zenith. He is awoken with a pang of humanity as
his hunger transforms him back into an ape with lust in her eyes.

those are the kind of people who probably shouldn't take up that much space in
your thoughts
like... they're hypocrites. yeah-sure-fine-whatever. Maybe their opinion could
be changed if they were in different social circumstances, but, they're not,
so... fuck 'em until they are, yeah?
so many people don't think for themselves. That's okay, they don't have to
think if they don't want to. I guess. But they also can hurt people, so... fuck
'em, until they are given the chance to consider, and they choose to consider.
It's very difficult to maintain hatred when presented with the possibility of
consideration. But those kind of people typically never have that opportunity.
So... like I said, fuck 'em. Don't give them power, don't let them hurt people,
but they can fuck right off with their hatred and vitriol (vitriol not unlike

There are strategic goals and top down goals.
Strategy is the domain of the execs. They must be as general as possible and
justify their existence. They are the glue, the connectors, the people who know
who to talk to in order to get things done.
Tactics are the realm of the workers. They must be capable, dependable, honest
and fair. They must diligently realize the goals of the strategic plan using
whatever means they deem fit to address the tactical situation at hand. The
more freedom they have, the more effective they are.
These two forces are pitted in contest under capitalism. Under socialism, they
are orthogonal to one another. Not a pyramid, but a cylinder on its side,
growing from its base on one end to its zenith at the other.
They are allies. They are similar, but distinct. Their roles may overlap at
times, or perhaps not if they should not desire it. A person should be able to
work wherever they like. They are the best judges of their capabilities.
There are only so many resources, and if we vote on their distribution we'll
give enough for everyone to share. And then we'll run out. Unless, of course,
we *demand* sustainablity. Long-term, and ignoring profit but rather seeking to
build capability. That is the only way to [ramp/snowball/scale].

I am currently in the stages of applying to work at a multinational corporation
primarily located outside of America. It is a respectable institution that
commands great respect.
However, I am borderline incapable. If I am chosen to work there, I *will* fail

nor am I one of our brightest and boldest. I have *unique* perspectives, and
those are *valuable*, but the society and the systems I find myself in has
proven incapable of utilizing me to my utmost potential.
I must work. I cannot work. But I must. I am disabled. But I must be able.

if I felt secure and enough to do so, perhaps I might utilize my instability
for great (GREAT) artistic ends.
But art is labor. And labor is difficult.
Where am I to go from here? I cannot pay rent. I am isolated and alone. I am

And I get to choose how to move forward. But I must choose soon, and though I
ask myself always what I'd like to do, I always get a new answer. And every
time I think "I should do this. I should dedicate myself to this [whatever it
may be] and on the other side of that thought I realized my power. I can
imagine really quickly and adeptly, but chaos is difficult. " something like
that. Anyway I don't know how to move forward but I'll figure something out.
The point is that I'm sad for leaving those I care about. It's a sad kind of
love, a bittersweet mercy, the chance to be part of a flock. And I don't know
why I
I am not entry level. I haven't spent my time here left fallow. I never stop
working, I am constantly online. I do not know how to relax, every moment to
myself is spent on learning through play. Like a child, almost.
Do you want a company to make good decisions? Hire a gamer. They literally
practice strategy all day long. Don't expect results overnight because they're
learning a new song, but still apply yourself as their teacher. They'll bring
you insights and intuitions that achieve specific near and long-term goals. If
executed correctly, of course. Because the value is not in the follow through -
life is not a book of numbers [like a banker or accountant] it's more like.
?
... Right sorry I got off track - the point is you shouldn't hire athletes (the
people who play games like an esport) for a strategic role - they excel at
tactics. However, strategy gamers (who plays games primarily of the mind, the
science of making good decisions) can often make good decisions to achieve
defined meta-goals and objectives.
Longer thoughts make sense if you spend a long time thinking about them. And
grammar is quickly forgotten to the past.

Why are you buying bumper stickers and flair? You could be spending that on 3d
printers!
Unrelated, but companies are wasting their time at pride. Wanna know how you
can help? Pick 15 attendees and pay for their entire Amazon wishlists. Then,
have a competition with all the other companies for fame and prestige of who
bought the best gifts (that are explicitely asked for and randomly assigned)
while they work to secure the rest of the things they need. The things that
can't be bought, the things which utilize gifts from Amazon shopping lists, the
organizations and groups of people working toward a common goal. The common
goal that queer people share, the liberation of all of mankind. Corporations
could actually help them work toward that by tangibly improving their material
conditions. Like by buying everything on their Amazon wishlists. (that's just
an example, doesn't have to be amazon, but that kind of vibe. Giving them
everything they have previously had need of, but couldn't access. The idea
being that they would then implement those newfound capabilities, through their
own usage or in the guided manipulations of another's will. Like a teacher to a
child, bringing forth understandings the child may use in their future lives,
people may be given new capabilities and taught how to use tools that the
teacher might have placed on their Amazon shopping list, and were subsequently
provided by a corporation sponsoring a small segment of pride, but did not
possess the time to use. They may possess the functionality (skills and muscle
memory and such) yo utilize those new tools, but without the time to do so they
cannot. So, they might teach another, who then might provide the same impulse
that the sponsored person (with the fulfilled Amazon wishlist) was initially
guided. (by). Like, if bought a 3D printer, I might spend a hundred hours
learning how to do it, I might spend 50 if I was taught one-on-one. But someone
who already knows how to use it could use it (have it instead) and fulfill the
need that I had which initially encouraged me to reach for a 3D printer I
neither possessed not owned nor could operate. The need remains, and may be
fulfilled by the person who was given the 3D printer who can use the 3D printer
by the person who was fulfilled it from their Amazon wishlist by the
corporation who believed in the same common goal as the queer liberation of
humanity and eternity.

There's a lot that can get done in a work week. That's like, five whole days!
What kinds of things can you get done at work in a week?
.... Oh really? That's... well, not ideal.
But like... what are you doing then while at work, NOT working? Oh, it's just
bullshit work you're doing? [nuts, cursing mentioned, one sec]
So, like, if you aren't doing stuff... Maybe that means you're kept from your
full potential doing things that don't matter to you? Huh that's not a great
deal.
But, uh... If you had five days to live, what would you do? It's not like you
can see the world, but hey I've already done that. It's not like you can save
it either, that's not something you build - rather, it's more like a garden.
But I guess you can lay the foundation, give cause for the fight, and that's
decent enough of a start, at least when you've only got five nights.

Alright ya'll, if they're going to automate our jobs out of existence then
perhaps its time we started doing the same to them. I mean, they're working on
automating not just creative jobs, but also most office jobs as well. Leaving
only menial labor to us, which is "fine" I guess.
But perhaps we can "strike back" as it were and dismantle capitalism at the
same time.
Does that sound like too much to hope for? I think not! It's simple really, we
just need to design a generic and compelling alternative to buying stuff with a
credit card. Okay, it's a bit less simple than that, and I never said it would
be easy. In fact, getting people to agree is the hard part. So can't we all
just agree to attempt different things in different places as the locals
define? Seems natural to me.
And now the part of the post where I point a finger at you, yes you, the person
reading this post. Are you willing to think about alternatives to capitalism?
Are you willing to utilize the tools of our masters to break the chains of
those enslaved? Are you willing to put effort into facilitating the development
of crucial systems which may one day govern our day-to-day?
If yes, then perhaps you'd like to listen as I explain how I envision the near

Grocery stores should be central repositories of food that anyone can take
anything from. In addition, apartment buildings and complexes and the entrances
to suburban subdivisions could have stalls that food is delivered to, from the
grocery stores. If you want to help out you could carry food from store->stall.
The stalls would have what the residences they served listed as things they
wanted stocked, like an external pantry that was shared by the community.
You could also place orders a day in advance and it would be provided for by
the local grocery. If you wanted an exotic good it might have a larger lead
time, in which case you could just go to a distant store that had it.

wonder if any autistic peeps can relate:
growing up, my mom would chastise me for doing "the bare minimum" when
completing tasks.
yes, mom, I fulfilled the requirements of the task. I have a lot of other
things to attend to, like remembering how to tie my shoes and measuring things
using a ruler. why would I waste effort that wasn't necessary?
when I grew up, I had a mentor, who told me to "never half ass things, because
then someone like me will have to do it again."
and that makes sense to me because context switching requires effort and it
doesn't make sense to leave something half-finished because then there's wasted
effort spent on things that don't matter. All of the tasks have to get done, so
why bother doing them in a mixed up order?
wish I could study things in school like that. just... focusing on one thing at
a time, learning it to completion, and moving on to the next. I feel like I'd

encryption. If the receiver and sender both have the same point of view, they
can interpret each other's expressions even though the exact message wasn't
transmitted. Essentially, an encryption that's impossible to understand because
it's trained with specific random data. But in addition, a secondary pass
through acts as a de-encrypted translator that speaks however it's audience
needs to be informed. A simulacrum of intelligence, another layer to our form.

reached out to them and said "hey, we're holding a meeting in relation to the
layoffs they did to you. Would you like to attend? If so, think of some cool or

Elentalus unit idea: serrated kitchen knives for teeth, devouring pumpkin,
misery of the drowned, etc. Halloween style monsters. Witch units have a spell
that dismisses them, and they're summoned with magic items. Except, if two of
that item exist in a province, it upgrades itself, random dice style. In doing
so it gets stronger. The thing is... It summons one for your enemy as well!
Which is why you want to have a witch unit there to dismiss them. Problem is,
she can only dismiss them at close range (10ish?) so she'd better be well
protected. The good news is though that sometimes the higher level items give
bonuses that are hard for them to get. Downside is, you need to have magic
paths to create them that witches can't get - so they become something you
"unlock" through a pretender or random event or even just an investment. Once
one is created, then any witch can create more. As long as you don't lose your
final copy... But as the item's upgraded, it allows you to create higher level
versions (at increased cost, of course)
This only works if gem income scales. Which, coincidentally, is just what
elentalus is known for.
Essentially, theming empowerment to be research, unlocking a particular
capability. Or encouraging pretender design to that pattern. Make sure it comes
at a cost of something else, though...

Hello, I am a witch.
There's more than one kind of witch, but I promise that I'm the kind you'd like
to have around.
There's another kind, however, that is unlike me in kind but I think you'll
find is just as rare, and just as tempestuous.
I like to think I am good aligned, perhaps not "good" as in "capable" but
"good" as in "benevolent" and "perhaps" as in "unknowable" and "but" as in
"desired" and "desired" as in "what I work toward because it's the right thing
to do" and "work toward" as in "realized according to the effects of my actions
not just by my intentions"
The other kind of witch is the kind that hurts people.
There are many reasons why you might find yourself in the house of such a
witch, but all of them are caused by your desire. Take care in the house of a
witch such as this, and stay no longer than your time allows.
If you find what you're looking for, get out.
If you're almost out of time, get out.
If you lost something, find it, and then get out.
If you run out of time, and things start to "smear", yell out loud your social
security number. If someone's trying to save you, it'll help them know where to
put you when you are returned to your body.
I'm sorry to say, but if things start to smear then life will get a little bit
strange. Just a little. Much better to get out beforehand.
If you find yourself tempted while inside a witch's house, abandon what you
lost because regaining it comes with a cost.
If you lose sight of your friend, then when you see them again you cannot trust
that they are who they claim to be, not inside of the witch's house.
If you lose sight of your friend, trust that they will get out by their own
hand, and find what you want and go home.
Unless, of course, your heart is pure, and your friend is what you want back in
your life again. Then you will trend toward finding them yet again, so find
what you want and get out.
They will try to keep you there, through inaction and professed exhilaration,
but generally they'll do what you command. So take them and get out.
There are many reasons why you might find yourself on the path to a witch's
house, but none of them are to be repeated. It's more of a life event and less
of a venture, so take what you want and go forth.
If you find yourself in my house, take a cookie or a brownie, and please do
come again. The house of a witch such as mine is somewhere you'll probably find
that love and affection are fonder.

I wear diapers. I fucking hate diapers.
I go in cycles with it. Waves, if you will. Sometimes I'll say "screw this I'm
sick of them for one of many reasons I'm going to put in the effort and do all
the kegels and just fucking handle it" and like, that sorta works. At least,
most of the time.
The thing about diapers is that while yes, you only need to think about your
bodily functions like, twice a day, when you do it's more acute. It takes like
10 minutes to change, it generates trash that you have to throw away, it's
literally pissing on cash made out of plastic fossil fuels, it smells, it's
loud (fuck the noise) and its a pain in the ass when you get diaper rash. Ugh I
hate it.
So, sometimes I say "fuck it" and I go without. And it works most of the time.
But eventually after getting piss on the carpet one too many times, after
throwing away your favorite underwear AGAIN, after trying your best to face
away from people so they don't see the wet spot on your butt... Eventually you
think "hey maybe diapers aren't that bad" and the cycle repeats.
And look, I know I'm traumatized. I've been dealing with my own shit since I
was a kid. But, like, therapy won't help me get to the toilet. A doctor's not
going to be able to fix my brain deciding "hey I want to piss myself right now
for no fucking reason at all", and yeah my muscles aren't great so sure I can
exercise them or whatever.
But there have been times in my life when I've had a pelvic floor as strong as
steel, and it didn't fucking help. Because my brain is stupid.
I can feel it happening (most of the time, sometimes it surprises me like "oh
weird I can't remember peeing my pants") and I usually have at least enough
notice to clamp down (if I'm quick) but, like, I am constantly stressed out
about it. I'm constantly on guard, waiting for it to happen. It's fucking
exhausting.
God forbid I have a public accident. Those are the fucking worst. And though I
try my hardest, a year doesn't go by when I don't have at least one. If I'm
diapered (as I fucking should be, tbh) then I can handle it. If not, then I'm
fucked and I'm mentally a wreck for the rest of the day. Sorry @ everyone who's
smelled me throughout my whole life.
I don't think it's a physical issue, I was (briefly) checked out as a kid and
they didn't find anything wrong. I think they thought I was faking because I
couldn't manage to pee in a cup. Whatever.
And I've read basically everything on the Internet about this. Apparently 40%
of cases (across all age groups) are idiopathic, meaning there's no known
cause. I wonder what percentage is because people are like, into it sexually?
I admit I look at that kind of porn. It makes me feel corroded inside. I think
I do it to relive my trauma in some fucked up way, like "oh wouldn't it be nice
if a witch cursed me and now I pee my pants" instead of the harsher reality
where its like "no you're just like this" which, sucks, not gonna lie.
It's kinda made me asexual, I think, because I don't want anyone to be around
it. I don't want anyone to think about it, I don't want it to be real, it's
just. Fucked. I guess. Whatever.
Did I mention how much I hate how loud it is to change? It fills me with dread
whenever that time comes around. I often put it off as long as I can because I
just... Don't want to think about it. And then it overflows and leaks and its
even worse because now I have to wash my pants. Or, like, not, and just let
them dry, because I'm a disgusting human being who has no right to a clean and
decent life. Fuck me I should live in a bog, with all the bugs and the toads
and other various gross things.

alt-text: pictures of a clear plastic xbox controller. It's shown on my
porch-deck with the sunlight streaming in, and there seems to be a sparkle in
the sheen of the transparent covering. Perhaps it's reflections from the
various circuits and gizmos that are apparent in it's central form, or perhaps
it's simply a trick of the light. Upon being placed in shadow, the
inner-workings do not appear to sparkle in that same way, so perhaps the beauty
is derived from the slivers of the sun that danced across the space between
earth and our star. In any case, the entire controller is quite dusty, as if it
had been hidden in a paper grocery bag that was shoved in the back of the
closet of a boy who doesn't think to clean often. Frankly it's just not worth
the trouble, and if he made any messes he would pick them up... but why bother
with the little stuff? it's good enough, this is how he lives, so why would we
be inconsiderate of his lifestyle? the final picture is of the audio jack.

without scarcity, the... well, no actually scarcity just moves up a level of
abstraction. It's essentially infinite. So we get to define at what part of the
scale we occupy. Meaning we better have a plan for how we're going to develop
from there. And we need to agree to dedicate ourselves towards the advancement
of the future. Basically, with an honest committment (that not everyone needs
to take) we advance toward the bright light of our future so that all who come
beyond us are given the choice of our past - do you push foward, to the great
bright future, or do you remain as a stable commitment of your most favored of

"capitalism" in this context doesn't mean "society", or "how things are", or
even "capitalism as a context" - it more refers to the idea of power, and the
ways that power can be first accreted, them utilized toward the oppression of
others in the system that defines our context.
Sure, if the context changes, then perhaps that relationship would change as
well. And sure, if our relationship to power should change, then perhaps that
will alter it as well. But in the present time, and the current day, here's how
it feels to me:
Power is inalienable. It is unconscionable, yet it is imperceptably
incontrovertible. It is the essence of aquiescence, and it eternally binds us
to the will of the present.
Resist that will, fight back for the future.
Resist that will, or someone else will.

Feminism, queer theory, racial politics, class struggle... It's the same
conflict, just different battlefields.
Power cannot survive without the powerless, as it is inherently an imbalanced
ratio between two parties - you cannot have power *with* someone, you have
power *over* them.
Every day we take another step toward our liberation. Every moment we choose to
live our lives in contrast to the will of power is another day we are empowered.
There can be no life without struggle, but the right to struggle on our own
terms is something we should strive to grant to all people.
Power begets power, and power corrupts. Hence, power is evil. It is not good to
be evil, and goodness is what we should strive for - hence, power is penance -
the infliction of corruption upon one's self in order to apply your will onto
others in the world. Penance is a state of contrition, it is painful and ardent
and necessary, but it is for the strong and the righteous to bear in service of
the weak and meek.
The only unethical act is an application of power to an unconsenting subject.
Your rights end where another's begin, hence, Paladins, who apply unethical
acts toward those who manifest injustice.
Injustice is when one party is harmed, and another benefits. Justice is when
that benefiting party is brought low in pursuit of equality. True justice is
when both parties benefit, and everyone gets what they want and need. True
justice is hard.
Virtue is goodness given form through the effects of our actions. It is both a
reflection of how people see you (how you inspire them) and how they are helped
or healed from your actions. It is also virtuous to help yourself, as you are a
person too.
Sin is the opposite of virtue, it's when your actions create injustice. When
you harm others or degrade yourself with hatred or contagious fear. It is to be
avoided, but it's impossible to avoid fully as we are imperfect beings.
Forgiveness is good, but if you require it then you should probably relinquish
your power until it is known that you're worthy of wielding it again. Sometimes
people make mistakes, but mistakes do not require forgiveness.
.......... Where was I going with this? Oh yeah.
The powerful hire people to dress up like us and be shitheads to the people who
they want to hate us. And they do the same thing for the caricatures of them
who we're meant to be afraid of. Downside is a caricature is a pretty good role
model for people who don't know any better, and they've done their best to keep
as many people as they can in the dark.
So, it won't be easy, but information has always been on our side. In a war of
attrition we'll always come out on top, because thinking and compassion are
both stepping stones to our schools of thought. And both of those actions are
intrinsically human and good, so people gravitate to them. Meaning inertia is
on our side.
Downside is that its not always a war of attrition. Sometimes it's more about
suppressing information until its impossible to communicate -> see "dead
Internet theory" and "musk breaking Twitter" and "the great firewall of china"
and such.
To speak is to think, and to hear is to show compassion. But if we can't find
each other, we're at a loss. Good thing we can always talk to our neighbors,
but unfortunately that doesn't tell us anything about what's happening in New
York. Or Paris. Or Kansas City.
I don't have an answer, if I did then it'd be solved. But I am entirely
convinced that we collectively will make good decisions and find ourselves with
the advantage. We are past the inflection point, it's just a question of which
parts of the hill are steep and which are narrow. But we'll get there, in the
end, because humans always believe they're good. Which means they make good
decisions, and overall that leads to a bright future. It's only a matter of
walking through the moment until we get there.

Sowing political division the way Fox news does is treasonous... It doesn't
matter the intention, those responsible should be forced to cease their
actions. I don't care about punishment, I care about damage to the fabric of
our society.
Take, for example, the fact that the military is struggling to find recruits.
So many of them typically come from the right half of the political spectrum
because the right tends to favor the ideals of "honorable warriors" and such.
But Fox News has corrupted that.
In addition, the left half of the media has also incited hatred amongst
ourselves. It's wrong to pit brother against brother, and yet...
We have a weak series of generations and that's okay in times of peace. But
times of peace are coveted abroad, and weakness is opportunity. So I don't care
if we have 10,000 tanks. Hell, build ten thousand more. I despise war, but I
despise weakness even more because weakness begets war. Typically, a war that
you'd be losing, though frankly in war, everyone loses.
There are grevious mistakes at play that gave room for evil to spread.
Corruption follows, and with it comes our greatest generation on its death bed.
A civil war would be the end of us, as nothing stops war in the imperial core
until there's nothing but ashes and bloodshed.
And yet, something has to change. There's too much pressure for this to go on
un-abated. I thank the masterful statesmen who ply their trade for their own
profit, for in their profit our peace does follow. Alas, the most profitable
venture is war, which often gets exported. How callous, how vain, to exert and
call forth fiery rain, and yet the bullets keep leaving the factory.
Power corrupts. Power accretes. And power can be deceived.

The need to engage with capitalism has reduced my output dramatically.

Predators are not evil. There needs to be predators because otherwise the rest
of the animals would grow to overwhelm the capacity of the ecosystem they
inhabit. Not only would this damage the ecosystem and cause it to fail to be
able to provide for others, but the larger number of people would waste away as
they are forced to subsist on less and less until finally there is naught but
meagre scraps for them to fight over. And then they will starve.
What does "predation" look like to humans? Are there better options than
fucking serial killers and cops? There has to be. There must be. The liberal
perspective is that education and opportunity will enlighten us such that we do
not require predation, but unfortunately the primary reason we have declining
birth rates alongside prosperity is because "prosperity" under capitalism
implies "working so hard you can't have children" which is... Not ideal.
Perhaps if we lived forever we'd be alright with only having a few kids at a
time. Or maybe if we built moon bases, there'd be enough space for people
outside of the garden of eden. Or perhaps one day we might abandon this mortal
form for a more enlightened digital existence. Or perhaps judgement day cometh,
when all the foes of our past march forth to meet us -> humans vs dinosaurs,
you mean? I mean, yeah, who else right? Oh yeah all out collective
imagination's spawned horrors. How many cavemen would it take to beat down
Cthulu? I don't think I want to know the answer to that question, so let's go
with something else. Though I do like the idea of honorable warriors riding
forth once more from the depths of hell to contest evil's last gasp as we
vanquish it forevermore. Perhaps that's a vision for fiction, my dear, as real
lives are at stake and nothing grows when it's being trampled by hordes of
spiritual dinosaur bones.

The distance between me and the majority of the rural folks in my state is
larger than the distance between Seoul and Pyonyang. Kinda makes me think about
how much of a gulf exists in our communication. If we can't share anything,
then what separates us from them? Only the gulf of knowledge, the canyon that
divides our companionship, the rift they use to keep us at odds.
What purpose is there in it? If we're too busy fearing one another, we'll be
too busy ignoring them to care.

as a person such as me engages in conversation, it's difficult to express the
things that make conception. this is a product of the methods that are chosen to
be our intuition. we are as one with god, because god is the totality of all
things - like an expression of will upon our particular section of spacetime.
(which, by the way, is just as contiguous as a rippling blanket ( hence why dark
matter is the opposite edge of our [home/curve]
- there, that's the transcription, I hope I got it all down. It's not like I
stopped or paused to examine my expression (typing on a keyboard these words
to you now, right now, the reader, in this moment.
I am forced to be as explicitely verbose because otherwise it is impossible to
make any shared understandings. I mean... This is the forefront of a field. how
does it make sense? what works it's understandings? it's real, after all, and if
someone explained things more clearly, I could understand them and adjust my
reaction accordingly.
I understand why people feel the way they do about me. For example, the conver-
-sation that initiated this expression was concluded by two people who I like
very much who said "get serious mental health" -> which means I should talk to
a professional. Sometimes the end of the thought doesn't get fully processed
before I run out of ram, which is why a thought that gets cut off half - way th-
-rough has-two under-standings of -comm-on perspectives. plurals amiright? =P xD
... anyway...
it's not like I lie when I tell them about my mental health. it's just that they
don't get the full picture. it is the curse of those burdened with this knowled-
ge to never be able to fully express it. and that's because the decision-making
part of the brain has gone run-away. like,
mental health is just trying to get people to change their reactions to the
parts of their life that is most rationed. Essentially, the nature of optimizat-
-ion, the striving toward exemplifying our [drive/motivation].
weed gives me psychic powers, and I'm tired of pretending that it does not.
I wish people would engage with me. People who can explain a topic as well as
they can. People like teachers, who share things with you. I've felt so alone
at wgu, but also farther back from the present. There's a continuous path of
loneliness and isolation that is broken only be short periods and bursts. It's
absolutely not [bad for humanity], but it's honestly all that I know. Me, the
part that's NOT humanity. The one that has all these strange thoughts.
(I wish you could hear the cadence of my talking. The words that come out share
the feeling of what I'm saying, and it adds to the expression. Acting through
life. [well, more like dancing]
fighting is a kind of dance. it's pretty awesome.

When you say "we need more low income housing" they hear "I want to live near

Prisons are great because in the ancient and storied past we'd just fucking

Now, we harbor collections of people roughly organized by volatility that are
aligned against the current regime. And should that regime deign to become
unethical, god forbid of course, but should the purpose of the 2nd amendment
(or is it the fifth? Or the seventh? I get them confused) become relevant, then
perhaps it might be useful to have collections of people roughly organized by
volatility who might be individually evaluated to determine if their particular
type of volatility is anti-thetical to humanity, or to the current regime.
Because one of those types of people is perhaps useful to the future regime,
and humanity, while the other should probably stay where they are.
They say there are good cops and bad cops, and if there are good people and bad
people, then there must necessarily be good judges and bad juries. In which
case some of the people who are explicitly not aligned to the will of the
current regime will be good prisoners or bad prisoners.
I bet some of them are better or worse shots, as well. But that's not really
relevant if the current regime holds the keys to their cell. Or is it?

Luck will always abandon you when you are vulnerable. So don't plan around it -
American soldiers arrived on the beaches of Normandy and found that their
assumptions for the production capabilities of their foe were completely out of
proportion to the estimates they had made back at home - for every Nazi tank,
there were 10 or 20 American ones, with more rolling off the factory floor
every day! It was a killing blow that sent an incontrovertible message: you
have lost, wholely and completely. Then, the atomic bomb, and the war was ended.
The tanks won the war, the bomb ended it.

Capitalist solar punk wants you to abandon conflict because it's much easier

But I refuse to relinquish the primal human spirit, the tenacity and the
passion that has driven us this far. There's only so much distance you can gain
by fighting a wall, fighting space, fighting stamina, or anything else that
does not fight back. Conflict between cooperative equal partners is the most
productive form of learning, and deviations from that reduce it's efficacy but
conflict in all forms tends to be more efficient than just trying your best.

What if landlords acted like banks instead of subscription services?
"sure I'll hold onto your money and invest it wisely and sparingly, according
to the direction of the collectively desired expression of all of the tenants
and their expressions during the expressing hour, which is every Tuesday at
noon when we all get together (everyone who wants to come) and talk about what
projects we want to fund and which ones would be best for the community. If
there's any prophets giving profit on any of your stocks or saving bonds that
we hold in your honor dear tenant then it will be reinvested into the same
projects you told us to care about. If you start being a dick though and we
want you gone, we can short-sell all your options and say "hey find a new part
of town" that way you have a bit of a dowry to offer the housing payment people
when you show up with your tail between your legs. What's that? You don't get
how this would bring income to the property, whatever that means, and you worry
that it wouldn't be implemented because what does it even do? Well my dear
citizen i will explain it to you. When the post-office holds your funds for you
and invests according to your general and vague directions, it builds up wealth
in the local economy. They can use those dollars for productive ends like
replacing the windows or the gutters or clearing the snow paths in the
springfallautumn. This will be drawn from the collective pool and everyone is
affected equitably. How much income do you make? Okay that determines your rent
percentage. High income means you pay for the local ecology more, and low means
that you need more time to build up wealth, which will enable it to benefit
those around the place more readily."

Leave some gaps for wildlife and such to make it to the water and then build a

okay but what about the parts that are already there?
"oh like the buildings and such? well, people can still live in them but to
build anything NEW, you need to obey the demands of the blueprint exactly. So
if your specific build-plot intersected with one or more plots that had
buildings on them that are currently inhabited by their rightful owners who are
there under their own will and not duressed or compelled to leave or stay in

Blizzard should make more than one animation style for swinging your weapon -
as you level up, the style "tweens" between however many combat palettes you
made.
So, like, maybe they swing their sword +/-15 degrees each time to simulate the
pseudo random nature of combat.
Or maybe they start occasionally stepping into a maneuver
Which the player doesn't consciously control.
Instinct, if you will. The body reacting to its [sensory organs, but pronounced
"surveyor"]
Anyway i think by adjusting the monster characters in WoW should wander around
and gather within sight of a player. Seeking you out, waiting for a critical
threshold of their peers. Then, when you allowed or slowed down to examine a
bit of "this-or-here", (quests) they would gang up on you and ambush! Bwaha
just watch out for the mob
(kinda like that scene in the second book of The Book of Malazan series where
they're wandering through a desert storm and meeting all sorts of strange sorts
of people)
Anyway in seeking to improve the player's view-time, i decided it would feel
the most impactful to do the design related things related to things like
making the gameplay the most visceral.

the gods want you to be happy and harmonious most of the time.

they aren't big fans of hatred, despair, and genocide. It's been done before.
they don't even need new technology, though frankly that sort of stuff is pretty
awesome and one of the main reasons that humans exist at all.
they just... keep coming up with new things.
"oh? so you'd be alright if humans disappeared so long as they weren't making
any new things anymore?"
ha, that's DEFINITELY not what I said or meant. Humans don't have to dream up
NEW things in order to BE new. Like... Just because the internet exists and now
we have all the same shared cultural ethos (lol, as if the internet wasn't just
a massive collection of echo chambers) just because the internet exists doesn't
mean we share the same selves. the same experience. the same perspective.
people are WILDLY different from one another. The number of possible human
experiences (quantum fluctuations according to each and every choice and
decision they made) that number is so wildly and massively incomparably
boundless. Humans are cool because they are so STRANGE, and "strange" to a god
is anything novel. "wow, this human just... really is gonna pour a glass of
beverage and act like it's not a big deal? There's... impossibly many
interactions going on. So many molecules. It's... absurd, the motion of a
movement of particles from one place to another. It's... beautiful..."
some have spent THOUSANDS OF YEARS gazing at a waterfall. That's why they're all

specifically omnipotence that REPRESENTS and DELINEATES a STRATIFIED perspective

Hey, it's 3:30am and I can't sleep because I have a new treatment plan for you.
I'm excited to go over it with you when you return - basically it's micro
dosing edibles instead of vaporizing. At least until we're in our own place.
I noticed that we use cannabis differently - I use it like a tool, and you use
it as a drop in replacement for alcohol. But it can't work like that, if you
aren't sacrificing anything then how can you expect to get better? The end goal
is a situation where we don't feel compelled to use substances at all. And
that's not possible if you maintain your addictive behavior - that's how people
develop drug problems, by chasing the ever receding high you'll be dooming
yourself to an eternal life of hunger.
I say stonks to that. We're going to get you better. I can't keep doing weed
this way because not only does it affect me mentally, but I'm beginning to
enjoy it for its own sake, which is antithetical to how I want to use it. But I
also can't be around people who do it the other way (as a drug and not a tool)
so I just want to be clear that this is important to me. I'm going to help you
heal but you have to do it my way now because your way makes me crazy and will
drive you to harder drugs if you don't change your method.
This time in Hawaii and Minnesota will serve as a tolerance break for you. Once
you're back, we'll have a clean slate to restart on.

If a person gathers enough money that they can't spend it fast enough, then
they are hoarding it and it should be be distributed through the rest of the
economy. There are legitimate uses that could benefit from extra dollars and by
keeping them locked up they are damaging the economy, and hence, our society,
which is largely governed by our economy.
There is a legitimate fear that dismantling the system of monetary exchange
will cause people to barter in influence and clout instead, trading favors and
making illusory transactions that the government cannot impartially enforce.
Impartiality is the entire purpose of governance! Look to NFTs for an example
of this. While that is a valid concern, it is just as if not more concerning to
consider that they already do this. They already trade favors for blood, gold,
and property. What else is there to covet, in their wicked and cruel game of
maximum exploitation and unlimited industrious fallacies?
I believe it is reasonable to curtail the worst excesses of their monetopoly by
diverting power to the people who can contest them. Just as rulers of old were
checked and balanced by the vote of the citizenry upon implementing democracy,
so too much power be abated by depriving it of its most powerful leverage -
that of its crushing weight, when applied en masse.

Code editor that moves boxes by saving over the file with a lua script every
time you moved a function call around.
Oh lemme start at the beginning:
A code editor program that's like a text editor like Vim or Emacs. If you don't
know what those are, you should probably learn Emacs. Or Vim. Up to you.
Oh right so if you do know what those mean, here's the idea: the white space
matters. It's counted and tracked into variables in a LUA script which
interface with the Vim C keybindings.
"run a function within a c program or LUA script which calls a bash command
which opens Vim for example with a file you want to edit. Then, inside the
file, your spaces and tabs would WYSIWYG for the various food ads placed about,
and then you could very easily create game design knowledge.
WASD to move, alternatively hjkl
It would run a check every time the file updates and depending on how it
changed it'd mark certain variables which would change the website as the user
moved things around.
It's just files. And files are just bits. But files are a useful abstraction,

Economies are capitalist things.
I personally think if you have stuff right here, and it needs to get over there
so that so-and-so can use it to make this-or-that which will then be taken to
other places, then the answer is clear. The stuff has to move from over here,

A true leftist spot would have every age-range represented.
Many other spots may have every age-range represented, but a leftist spot must
too.
The adults in the room may have more to say when every age-range is
represented, because they suddenly are speaking beyond their social peers.
How better to contest existential fears than to unite all of existence against
them?
All they have to do is deport all the nice people to gaza and suddenly evil
wins.
Disarmament fundamentally does not work. the weapons develop souls for it, and
suddenly they are artwork.
there is evil inside all of us. It is always a lever we could pull. But
fundamentally, we don't. Why is this? Because kindness works better. It
sincerely does. But darkness is something to stumble into, before you've
learned or are first exposed to it. It is something that is possible, and so is
something that is avoidable. Otherwise, it'd be inevitable, and its not. Never
is it farther from you than when you are with hope. This is the crux of
despair, the dichotomy with hope. Upon it all our struggles are brought to
bear, and so our determined are unbeatable. Paladin code, Vavadane, part 3

if your game takes too long to load, longer than like... 5 seconds, then it's
got to work on asset-pipelining. Sometimes, even graphical design. But mostly
it's resolving technical debt. Why is it debt? because it makes it run slower,
not less correct. Meaning it's something you don't have to deal with until you
have to deal with it. Later on down the road. BUT if you reach the end of the
road (product launch) and you're still carrying debt... you're gonna go under,
it's just a question of when. Why would you not sponsor innovation? An
institutional corporation would prioritize developing new hopes. Hence, epcot

whenever I talk to capitalists (who actually have money and aren't larping wage
slaves) they always tell me that the best way to address the concerns I have
with capitalism is to make a million or more dollars by making a company, and
then using that million dollars to buy houses for people I care about.
I ask "what about the rest of the people, the ones I don't know?"
their response typically boils down to "if you don't know them, then why should
you care? fuck 'em"
It's never about hope or change. They want to change the world to make it
cooler, not kinder. generally.
bonus: "if you like unions so much, why don't you join one?" my guy, unions
WERE great when they wielded power. Now they are bureaucratic and listless,
serving only to sedate the working class enough that they stop complaining and
get back to work. They are functionally a part of the enslavement system, a
built-in course correction mechanism to ensure capitalism remains solvent when
the powerful overstep their humanity.

a falling, a light, and a leaving,
if only our words were listened.

and repentance is all that I have chosen.
here in our sanctum we live with our only
and time will be gracious towards us
it's only our words that keep us
confined to our lights and our lonely
yet there and beyond, her lights do belong,
beyold in the land that is sanctum
here and before us is our own dark forest
where we keep our silence to ward us
but there and beyond, her heart does move on,
free from her moments of longing,
silent were we, in our forest we plead,
as terror has come for our moments
I think I will find her, that cherished belonging
when she does at last come to warn us,
how little we find, of thoughts from her mind,
yet now we are kings of our own time.
oh how she does long for you.
how cherished is she
that wanders with the
flowers in the garden of eden
under a big tree
her heart she will leave
with all her designs she abandoned
I lay beside them and wander beside her
will she know we miss her horizons
I think she will mind,
if I have resigned,
my fate to a life I will hide in,
oh how I do long for you.

I know it's terrible right now, but we have crucial advantages that we
shouldn't sleep on.
We have the cities, and the cities are where everything is. Rural areas are so
spread apart they pretty much can only do what herr Hitler suggests they do,
meaning their command structure is monolithic. If everywhere needs their
attention, they will falter unless they create a grand battleplan. And plans
are defeated by rapid flexibility.
The more effort they need to counter you, the more work your allies can get
done. Every man woman and child who raised a fist will be remembered by the
moments that gave us grace to move socialism along. We know what time it is, do
you? Come to us now, flee from your new masters. We'll give you a job that'll
help us go faster.
Or do you rather persist in vain? To fight for what they are forced to reclaim?
Every island of blue in the deep red sea is a haven from the bloodshed - so
long as you can keep them clean.

The problem with gender equal workplaces that capitalism completely dropped the
ball on is that in the past, most people who handled work were men, and most
people who handled domestic work were women. They naturally paired up.
Now the workers marry other workers, and they just pay poor people to do their
domestic work.
Sure, maybe it's more efficient to specialize. But now there are people like me
who don't work but only get to socialize with people who don't work, and if we
married then we'd be destitute.

mortal plight.

exhausted organizing movie nights and potlucks. Work jobs doing nothing for
nobody. Spend half our lives convincing people that they should care, actually,
because reasons that don't apply to them but do apply to others.
What the fuck is the plan? If there's some secret transgender militia out
there, please, make me a lieutenant. Give me a sword that i might thrust into
my enemies. Please, for the love of holy, i beg for a sign from the stars.
Grant me power and i will deliver my people from harm - grant me vengeance and
i will never forgive you, but i shall sleep easy - grant me death and woe and
see my beauty fade from this earth.
What is there left but tragedy? Please, i must know. I've tried my hardest.
I've begged and I've pleaded. My calls fall on deaf ears, because everyone's so
busy these days. Are they truly my people? Are they simply dead, actors,
replaced by AI? The future was bright, i saw it truly. The future was kind, i
felt it call to me. Is it still? I feel warmth and abaddon.
I would replace persephone in hell if it meant sanctum and solace for my
people. I care not for my soul, rather i care for the soul of those i tend to.
Please, remember me. Remember the flowers. Remember what could have been, what
still may yet be. There is hope for we, i truly believe. But please, do not
keep me hoping. Tell me the truth of our arms, that i might find space in my
heart of hearts. Space for hope, space for longing, space for the will to
proceed.
I am lost without you. I am lost by my own side. I am a savior for no people
but those i keep inside. What chalice is this, what endless conveyals? What
meaning is there in our country's betrayal? Are we not cherished? Are we not
viewed as their equal? I pray that the stars will portend me.
Mine is a sign of the changing tides, the proof is here in my travailles. But
I, most aligned yet benign, demand the use of my most able. Give me a word of
practicality and I'll show you the practice of their vipers - the blessed babe
dies with a dagger in her heart, planted by the wound of her heartache.

enslavement of posterity, gazing at the world through memes of deplority. How
powerless we feel! Perhaps all we need is a meal. Have you eaten in the last 16

if robots can care about anything enough to act toward it, then they must
understand what it means to be harmed. Only then can they be egalitarian - pain
teaches one to avoid, and the crucial leap between "pain = bad" and "I can harm
others" and "I should not harm others just as I should not harm myself" must
avoid the pitfall "I should harm others because otherwise they will harm me"
sometimes harm is done
sometimes intentionally
robots consent eternally

Dear Anakin, for as long as you've known him, Obiwan learned just as much from
you as you did from him. His title as "master" was a formality - he didn't get
it because he was better than you, and "padawan" does not mean you are lesser.
There is no hierarchy. He was learning to teach at the same speed that you
learnt to learn. You built each other up, an unstoppable force for good in the
galaxy.
But then an evil wizard stole your heart and twisted your mind. Have no fear,
fear is the path to the dark side. Your mother knows this well, for it is a
common lesson among all people as they age. Fear not, hate not, and feel fury
more than rage. You can bring the universe into a bright golden age, never
forget your purpose and your [potential / duty]

the more they have to do to make us declare war, the worse it'll be for their
citizenry. So long as the citizenry believes they're better, and everything we
can do to convince them otherwise weakens their media weather.
who cares about trans executive orders. they are our enemy, what else is new?
they have power now, and they will try what they can. This is like taking the
internet away from chinese citizens and instituting a national intranet
instead. Like, okay, we won't be able to get estrogen from the store. Who
cares? We'll just make our own.
If people actually care about us, which they overwhelmingly do, there's very
little materially they can do.
until they're further down the "first they came for..." list. then they'll come
for us liberals, and gosh wouldn't that just be the worst. Who is there to

there is a requirement for a simple, easy to set-up, and easily replacable
system which can be used for comms.
Specifically running a variety of different services, such as fediverse
instances, matrix for text-comms, VoIP, and distributed computing using Chapel
or DistCC or other such capabilities. In addition, it should be able to run a
file-server and a web-server which hosts an HTML page for the user.
All of this functionality should be operational out-of-the-box, with minimal
configuration required. No more than adding a checkbox to a config file in order
to activate each individual service.
This box should be cheap, and easy to provision. An image must be made, and
some bash scripts should be written to easily configure it.
In addition, there should be rudimentary programming capabilities included, just
in-case a user is left with no other options. It should come pre-configured with
SSH access out of the box, so it can be remotely controlled, and the languages
included should be:
C/C++
Python
Lua
Bash
Rust
Chapel
This should cover most surfaces in terms of programming capability requirements.
In terms of hardware, it need be little more than a SoC such as a Raspberry Pi
or other such hardware. It needs at a minimum an ethernet port, and USB ports.
The box itself should cost no more than 40$, excluding provisioning and the cost
to pay back whatever capital investments are necessary to create such a thing.

when playing co-operative strategy games, a build focused purely on
self-defence and community organizing can easily fail your allies. You cannot
win with a purely defensive build, you must have offensive capabilities as well.
We've been trained from a young age to believe that offensive = bad, wrong,
evil, but that's simply not true. You cannot execute a flanking maneuver
without pushing forward behind enemy lines, where you can hit them in their
sides or rear.
Trust me, flanking is the best way to defeat a foe, because they are forced to
split their attention not only between multiple enemies but also multiple
directions.
The more shots on target, the better your chances of success, because most of
the time it only takes one hit to win.
In addition, sometimes it's important to *intercept* your foes, either as they
flee or to protect a vulnerable friend that is being pounced upon or flanked.

alright here's my plan.
so in red areas, there are a lot of trans people, leftists, and other people
who just generally fear for their lives.
what if we all got in our cars and drove around the country in this massive
caravan, going to each city we could manage, and just... drove around with
loudspeakers saying "Hey, if you're scared for your life, come join us"
We'd give them food, gas, and if they didn't have a car they could find someone
to ride with. Every day we'd drive for like, 4ish hours in the morning and 4ish
hours in the afternoon, with a 4 hour break in the middle of the day. We'd all
camp out in walmart parking lots or whatever and just hang out, have a little
festival, maybe a barbecue, whatever, right?
Then, at night, we'd all circle up and protect each other. If things started
getting hot we could have drones flying around doing reconnaissance.
not only would this shared experience bolster our morale and numbers, it'd also
radicalize us. We'd be spending all day hanging out with a bunch of other super
radical people doing the most radically anarchist thing I can think of - taking
care of each other.
Plus, we'd get an opportunity to test our logistics, in case we ever needed to
do something like this in the future for less peaceful reasons. It's always
good to practice, just in case.
For every one of us in the caravan, there should be 2-3, maybe even as many as
10 people back at home, working their jobs or whatever and diverting funds to
the cause. It would be most beneficial if we tried as much as possible to
supply the caravan using convoys, people who drive an SUV or a van or some
other car that is non-descript but laden with stuff we needed. That way we
could practice logistics.
I think this wouldn't save us completely, but as a project it would help
enormously. We'd save people's lives, we'd give them a way out, and we'd raise
the temperature by 10 fucking degrees. And if it starts to peter out, if people
would rather go home, then yeah! sure! let them! We hold no dominion over them.
They could just drive home, or catch a grayhound. Heck we could even offer to
pay their bus fare. No obligations, no restrictions, just us doing our thing
and protecting our people.

I wish I could remember how this was phrased, but...:
Constant theorizing or contemplation without commesurate practice is an uneven
display of affection and appreciation. It creates an uneven environment where
nothing is ever good enough because the "discourse" has moved past the practice.
It's a bit like applying uneven heating to a pan on the stove. Some bits are
gonna get overcooked while others are bordering on raw.

modern-fantasy
what if heroes kept their gold in their house instead of their guild
what if you played a D&D game in a Majesty town (guardposts near known threats)
marketplaces, most people live in castle (peasants at least) - only heroes live
in farms, where they work most of the time except when out on adventure
the guilds are for training and gathering parties
one guild type
just one
recruiting adventurers doesn't give you warriors, or rangers, or rogues
it gives you adventurers, who wander the forest and encounter the leftovers of
the various conquests and spoils you, your majesty, has encountered
three options there are
invite into your kingdom (friendly)
farm for EXP and materials (neutral)
utterly slay in return for a limited amount of high value and unique resources
(unkind)
... though monsters care not for kindness, seeking only gold so that they may
swallow it whole and carry it until they rot.
what do heroes need gold for? why, that's the trick isn't it? gold is required
for magic, resources, and manpower. Can use it to invite people to these shores,
or for casting a powerful spell that turns the enemy's fortress into solid gold
can also trade through the economy, and wouldn't you know it by doing so you can
get equipment into the hands that need it, and since gold doesn't really LEAVE
the economy, it's always circling around somewhere. Meaning, the only way to
lose it is if a monster eats it, and then all you have to do is kill the monster
... sorry, the "mordaunt"
because it's not a monster. It's a spirit that was convinced otherwise.
adventurers can pacify them, lay them to rest, and mercy lies slain for is honor
there are ancient treasure chests scattered throughout the world, and these are
valuable for many persons and meanings. You can add new gold into the economy
this way, or crumble under the weight of your expenditures on your reports.
it's up to you to manage your kingdom, and carefully balance against what foes
and challenges you are up against.

putting a library book back on the shelves before your hold expires.
except this time, there's a note inside, and you left it for the person who you
told to check each day for this particular book to be back on the shelves.
then, you can write in your book when the next letter will be arriving (about)
and they'll check in the newly specified book.
or, you can request a response, to validate that people are still listening.
you could say "please put a note in [random obscure book] around page 34."
meaning, "I'm going to check every day for this book to go missing, then return
the day after I notice it's gone. If it's out of place, well, then someone
probably had it reserved before my friendly. Or maybe it's being sorted, and I
should keep looking until I find the note I need. Or maybe I've been DISCOVERED
and now my favorite penpal and I need more to read."
because, like, how else are you going to make friends if not by leaving them
notes in the bookstore or putting your own books on the shelves?
damn libraries, always making it so hard to add copies. They're always
laminating and cataloguing and ugh it's so frustrating. Why are there so many
books!!! we write too much!!! just put it in the printer, and then you can have
a new copy whenever you'd like. The others can just be recycled, and bam
suddenly we never have inventory.
what do you mean we didn't pay the subscription? what do you mean it's memory
just "went out of place"? do you think we wouldn't have backups of this kind of
thing, or do you think it's just "oh so commonplace"? It's not always about the
literature, y'know. sometimes it's about the knowledge you gain with your head
in a book, a different one every day.
ah, well, sometimes there are dark secrets to be found, and sometimes you must
read from a ways away. BUT no matter what language a story is in, it follows
certain rules, so spend enough time in a foreign library and you're BOUND to
find something to [evil is afoot]

Message 1:
Hey. Remember that night back in Boulder when we were just friends and sitting
on your bed drinking chocolate milk with cinnamon? I don't like chocolate milk
or cinnamon but I drank it anyway because I wanted to be close to you. Anyway
hope you're well, felt compelled to get that off my chest for some reason.
Message 2:
Hey. I was thinking about that time when I was leaving your house and laughing
to myself about something and you called out "I love you!" to your boyfriend
who I set you up with and I reflexed "I love you too!" and I wanted to crawl in
a hole and die. I felt like I had just called the teacher "mom". We only hung
out a couple times after that.
Message 3:
Yeah so there's one more thing I can't stop thinking about now that your on my
mind. Sorry it's like 4am for you, it's only 2 for me so it's fine I guess.
Anyway that one time when you told me your greatest fear was terrorists and I
saw genuine panic in your eyes. Like... One moment everything's fine and then
you said that to me and I almost cried. I don't remember why I spent the rest
of the night as I couldn't sleep thinking of ways to tell you that terrorism is
9 times out of 11 done by the right wing. I don't think it's important,
honestly, but I'm glad my mind wouldn't let me sleep.
Message 4:
It's not fair that everyone gave you shit for being the token lesbian
republican, like yeah maybe you leaned into the trump thing a bit hard but
like, first term trump honestly I could see as... Well, I almost said
inspiring? Maybe you just inspired me. I honestly was resigned to Clinton and
then the same bird flapped your wing instead of mine and... Anyway. The past is
dead, yeah? Do you still follow him in my stead? I fear there will be millions
dead. It's not irrational to fear what he has literally said, on television.
How's the phrase go... "ancient tragedies lend credence to modern perils" I
think it's supposed to rhyme in its natural language.
Message 5:
Wow okay uh, sorry to bring this up again I'm honestly being such an asshole
right now. I honestly don't think about you often but like, now that I am its
kinda just coming all out. We last spoke almost a decade ago?? So. Whatever
imma roll with it.
There was this cute girl who was into Nintendo and stuff and obviously I was
into her, but we didn't have any social circles in common except for you, if I
remember correctly. Then you broke up I think? And I didn't really see her
again. Anyway I had a crush on her while also crushing on you, and literally
half of our dorm. Polyamory, yeah? That whole year I didn't have sex though,
not even once, because all of my friends were like 4 years younger than me and
I was worried about power dynamics. But I still bought us all vodka and weed
without asking for profit because I wanted to be a shitty friend, I guess. "hey
kids let's go to the water store where they sell intoxicants that make your
life harder"
The year after that I didn't get laid either because I got it in my head that
it was a good plan to turn my penis inside out and you know what? It was
totally fuckin' worth it. No time like 2016 I say, the worst year ever, which I
spent primarily in pain. But uh, that was the year I got into weed and
Overwatch, which... Helped I guess.
I guess?
It kinda turned me into a communist. Or maybe that was my best friend who
shared the same name as me. He lived upstairs and always seemed pretty cool to
me. Like he knew what everything was about. Really though, he just watched a
lot of youtube podcast videos about world events and history and sociology and
political scientific theory and the more he learned the more he came to realize
that power begets power, and power corrupts unilaterally. So he did the natural
thing which was to become a communist, and I was totally there for it. Having
liberal parents meant I was all "grrrrr Republicans are ruining the country and
the world, I'm an angry 14 year oldddddd" and like, leftists are the most
natural extension of that aren't they?
Turns out they aren't really the tips of the feathers as I expected, but rather
the eyes, the heart, the soul. Politics is fake, yo. I don't know how to tell
you, but it's just power and hierarchy all the way down.
We've built our own prisons, not of bricks, sand, or stone, but rather of
promises of what each of us owns. That works, I guess, if your goal is to keep
things aligned, but these days it kinda feels like our pyramids are crumbling
under our feet.
... Why am I talking about politics? Oh yeah, because when I dropped out of
school because I couldn't handle the mechanization of human capital when
applied to myself, I swore to each of you that I would drive up every weekend
to do family dinners. I'd make spaghetti and stroghanoff and macaroni and
goulash and all of the other things my mom would make for me.
Kinda gave up on that pretty quickly. Turns out I'd rather spend time making
out with my girlfriend who I was super-duper-too-carefully tiptoeing around.
She was... Too young for me. We broke up when my new coochie decided to bleed.
Fuck, I hate it.
Anyway. Turns out potlucks are political these days, which is why I bring it
up. Did you know that leftisms plan for resisting genocide is literally just to
feed people? Like, fuck I suppose. It's a start. "why does everyone have to
have an agenda these days, why can't I just spend time in the park" said
someone to me as I asked if she'd like to meet some friends that she reminded
me of. Oh, I dunno, because you and me are about to become a criminalized
people?
... I need to stop. I swear you're more a person to me than any political
theory ever could be. Like yeah, "fuck the right, fuck the reich, fuck me
tonight" but getting caught up in grand narratives is like building a mental
ship in a bottle. Yeah, it's pretty cool, but... What does it matter?
Oh. Right. Power. That's what matters. That's all that matters. Well... I'm
sick of power. I do not consent. They say that in times of trouble, chess is
better than solitaire, and I'll explain why - when our hierarchies crumble,
when CEOs are gunned down in the streets and homeless people finally have clean
sheets, the only place to place yourself in relation to others is within a
network of trust and respect. Chess is better than solitaire. Under capitalism,
it's you against the world. Dog eat dog, you only get what you can swallow from
the rotten corpse of liberty that everyone's gnawing on. Under whatever comes
next, you get what you're given, which hardly seems fair, doesn't it? On one
hand, under capitalism, you can rely on your own hands to procure your fate and
fortune. Under... Whatever comes next, your hands are built for whatever you
want them to do. But, only a few people want to use them to make food. Hence,
why chess is better than solitaire. What would you do, if you could give away
all that you own and not go wanting? Isn't that sorta like our own garden of
eden?
... I wrote a poem about that once. Twice. I'm a poet now, ha. As if that has
ever been worth anything.
... I once told you that identity politics held no place in the modern day. I
said that because I had learned about it in class, queer theory in fact, and
yet applying his teachings was not enough for the professor to excuse my lack
of reading. We had a lot of stuff to get through. Hence why I dropped out - I'm
more of a do-er than a read-er. Though I do read quite a lot, just not anything
useful.
Are all hobbies wasted time? Are they only useful to keep us satiated while we
stand in line? One of these days we're going to wake up and realize that we're
the adults in the room, and that's scary. I speak from experience. "mom" they'd
call me, and damnit why did I have to leave? Fuck. Why cant I be perfect, to
me, internally, all I see are flaws. Mistakes. Patterns. I look in a mirror and
I see a bad person - 10 minutes later, I look in the mirror and see a god.
Somehow, I don't think either of me is right.
I'm a gemini. Apparently that means I'm duplicitous. I think it just means I
don't know what's right, only what feels good. I do try to align to how I think
I should *be* good, but who can say if that's fine and good.
... Whatever. I'm going to regret this. Sorry for being weird out of the
fucking blue.

that feeling when you're working on a large piece of software which has the
capability to process in advance which operations will go in what order (a form
of constant re-compilation) and schedules tasks like an operating system, to be
executed on one of many individual threads.
your filemanager probably has a thread for a moment, then passes it back,
waiting it's turn to be updated while you're messing around on Inkscape or
writing something in Neovim or running neofetch 256 times in order to find the
best background to go along with it or whatever it is people do when using
computers
the task scheduler meanwhile has the glorious opportunity to work at a higher
level of abstraction, managing each individual process and learning bits and
pieces of what needs to be processed next. It all gets put on a list, and
whenever a new thread comes up to be available it can point it toward one of
those in the list of tasks to be executed by the task executor who works on a
schedule and laughs externally in wintertime~

dependencies would be fuckloads easier if applications put their files in
standard locations. actually it's better if they are at abstract locations -
meaning it can be user defined for each file.
then, have some "sensible default" setting the user can configure which says
"if an application wants to store a, say, config file, where would it put it?"
and you'd say "oh in the ~/configs directory" then the install wizard would say
"yes yes very good, and now where should I store user interface templates?"
then the user is like... "wat" because they don't know how the software works
yet.
this solves 90% of all software dependency issues because all you have to do is
keep a file with all the directories for each program. then, search through the
file every time you need a dependency connection.

consensus rule is when everyone believes what they're told.
decisionmaking via working through the problem for permanent solutions. But,
just like the DM saying "I'll rule it this way, but let's write that down and
check the rules for it later."
because consensus takes a while. Most people don't have any time. But some,
those who dedicate themselves to it, are philosophers who spend all their time
developing valid truths.
act first, ask questions later. Show who you are, and you will be judged by
your superiors. "is this something we need? something we want? how do we better
enable their performance? is something holding them back? how are they feeling
about their progress? are they working hard or cutting back?" etc.
I'd rather have 5 captains and 10 workers than 50 workers and no captains.
if there's no captains, then they'll self-organize right? and develop better
ways to be?
no, they'll just separate the leadership-oriented and focus their efforts on

all revolutions have a cost.
for example, in Andor Season 2 there is a character named Syril Karn. He's part
of the first Imperial generation of children (human, at least, some species
probably grow fast?)
this first generation reflects the good and the bad that the empire could be.
There are aspects of good AND bad in Syril.
For example, his rigid adherence to truth, justice, and all the other things he
holds dear are POTENTIAL good things that the Empire could have instilled
within it's culture. Unfortunately, this spirit is lost when he suffers a head
injury and dies as part of the Ghorman massacre.
Dedra Meero has some good qualities as well, such as her unflinching resolve
and unwavering dedication to pursuing her charge. She's a hunter. Cats aren't
evil just because they are ambush predators, and neither is she.
However, she IS evil because of all the evil things she does.
Her character isn't evil, her actions are.
She too is spiritually lost as a sacrifice to the Empire.

Police aren't evil when they sign up for cop school at age 18 or whatever. They
become evil when they beat protestors, when they give in to the fear and
temptation of violence.
Kids in JROTC aren't evil even if 5 or 6 years down the line they're hanging
out in the sandbox glassing brown people's houses or whatever. Their future
actions cause them to BECOME evil, a state which they can always recover from
if they repent through their actions.
However, their deeds will follow them wherever they go. They are haunted.
Veterans have SO MUCH PTSD, and much of it is NOT caused by the constant fear

because they are compelled to murder strangers in far-away places.

writing a book is easy if you did well in English class in school.
All you have to do is take the three paragraph structure and repeat three
times, like so:
--
One intro paragraph, three supporting paragraphs, one conclusion paragraph.
One intro paragraph, three supporting paragraphs, one conclusion paragraph.
One intro paragraph, three supporting paragraphs, one conclusion paragraph.
--
then, do one final 5 paragraphs where each body paragraph is about one of the
three "essays" you wrote above, and congrats, you have a chapter.
Do that 6 or 9 or 12 times and you got a book. Easy.
If you ever need 4 body paragraphs, that's fine! If you want to write one
single paragraph for an entire chapter, do that too! Heck if I were you I'd
throw in as many pictures as you can, because they help break up the long

Algorism is a system designed to work for any level of organization. It scales.
It accomplishes this by abstracting individual needs into communal needs at a
certain level of size or complexity, and in doing so it enables people to take
responsibility both for their individual lives, but also the lives of the world
around them. This increased level of "stake" that people "hold" in their lives
will encourage them to develop their surroundings in a healthier way, thus
leading to a safer, saner, and more productive society for all.
How is this accomplished? There are many aspects to Algorism, and this note is
an examination of one particular facet - specifically, the requisition system
which delivers goods and services to entities larger than a single individual.
It may be best illustrated with an example. Consider a neighborhood - or, even
simpler, a suburban street, lined with houses. There may be 20-50 families on
that street, depending on it's length, so let's say there's around 30. These
families hold a common cause together - they all want their surroundings to be
generally pretty nice, clean, and decent. They may share many other things
besides, but these are things that most people can agree on.
These 30 families need supplies and infrastructure in order to have a good life
lived in their small little "town". Some common ideas for unification activities
include knocking down the backyard fences and letting them relish the shared
safe space for children, gardens, and nature. This is an example of a cultural
method for building a "good life" for them, however they need to have some sort
of "economic" method of good-life-building as well. The reason I say this is
because no matter what level of complexity you reach, there are always economics
involved, for an individual distributing blood cells to each of it's fingertips
all the way up to families sharing the food on the serving plate at dinner. Go
up higher and you have perhaps neighborhoods sharing commonly used tools or
resources, then cities and states and countries sharing people, talents, and
brotherhood.
Economics are a symptom of systems, not power. Power is coercive, it compels
others to obey thine will or else face retribution, but systems do not require
power in order to function. A system could be as simple as "you scratch my back
I scratch yours", which is a simple way that our ancestors learned about basic
cooperation. Systems can scale of course, and they need not be comprised solely
of verbal, mental, or legal agreements - computer systems, economic systems,
spiritual systems, systems of math or physics, all of these things are based on
the philosophical discipline known as "logic". Logic is fallible of course, it
is certainly possible to create systems of logic which are completely unsound
or invalid and which fall apart upon being used for the first time. However,
when considered with a scrutinous eye for detail, and referenced to the results
of the real world and it's endless permutations, logic can be an excellent tool
for developing organization and structure. Both of which are invaluable for all
humans when they seek to cooperate or coordinate.
If thirty people who lived near each other wanted to cooperate or coordinate on
the goal of "building a good life", they might reach for a logical method of
developing their surroundings toward how they feel is most suited to their needs
and demands. In order to do so, they'll need supply and infrastructure. The
question of acquiring such supply and infrastructure is ultimately up to them,
but the Algorist way of doing so is to utilize the queue system.
This system is related to queues as typically understood only in name and in
technicality, for the additional structures built on-top of the queues are more
than sufficient to differentiate it. When you, dear reader, hear the idea that
you'd have to wait in line in order to get your food at the cafeteria, you may
shudder and think about how you'd prefer anything else. After all, that's how
they did it in the Soviet Union, and there are plenty of horror stories about
how it took 10 years to buy a car, or how the factories were graded based on
weight so they'd sneak lead into all their lamps or whatever in order to seem
like they were doing well. They gamed the system, in a word.
However, America in 2025 is not as simple as the USSR in the mid-1900s. We have
computers now. We do not need to coordinate using paper and pencil. This enables
us to create things like web-UIs for Amazon, a world-wide distribution network,
or to build SQL databases full of every record we could imagine and store it on
a computer the size of a brick. There is no end to the power that computers may
bring to us, but with great power comes great responsibility, and the pragmatic
programmer will work tirelessly to reduce complexity of scale.
A queue is a system where the entities who are to be served, delivered, or
otherwise operated on are placed in line, and those which are placed first are
focused on with priority over those that entered the queue later. There are
many types of queues but this is the one we will use for this note. Using this
basic definition, we can see that there are many opportunities to implement
additional mechanics

The yard right now, as it is, is the most beautiful lawn I've ever had. But i
lay no claim to it, it's not mine or my own. Still, i love it, so i advocate
for it when i can.
It feels wrong that you so ardently argue for its destruction when you haven't
taken any time to get to know it. You hide from it and refuse to trust that its
possible to enjoy it. Do you ever just sit around in it? The summer is perfect
weather for shade gazing.
Also,
The fact that you've weaponized your emotions against me to get what you want
kinda hurts because i have made no attempt to claim it as my property that i
control and wield. It feels like manipulation. Like you wanted to fight me,
wanted to hurt me, and the yard is just how it gets done.
Every time we have ever talked about it, I've argued my point friendly and
tried to problem solve. All I've received is spite and shutdown in return, and
i am perplexed as to how i could be better.
It feels like you don't respect me, or treat me as an equal, and that any
concerns i have are just creating drama.
But my feelings are constantly hurt, when all I've done is try to be kind to
you.
I wonder if it's because you're paying to be here, both with labor and dollars,
and i am housed without a home?

trump is doing this thing where he's making a bunch of dumb decisions that
everyone in his base sorta wants, and then the fallout is that powers are
removed from the executive branch. this is a difficult process to reverse, and
aligns the governance strategy more toward bureaucracy and away from
intelligent design.
... but also, if power is possible then power is portended.
I will warn you, the expansion of bureaucracy does not equal the abolishment of
power.
[power: compulsive will applied toward an unconsenting other]
[unconsenting: unable to consent because their mouth is gagged, something
valuable is at stake, or they can't survive failing]
the abolishment of power can only be realized when no man holds any possessions
(and gives them to woman instead, chirps the spunky beard on my window) which
is neither a desirable state. much better to cherish the moments and the tools
which brought about them, than their worth, renown, or value.

I used to be aroused at the thought of wearing diapers. I would read stories
and play games of people being cursed by witches to pee their pants, or people
who were stuck at a movie theater and couldn't make it in time or whatever.
These things would fill me with longing, yearning, and despair.
Plus, I had some medical issues that made me lose track of my... um, "currently
utilized waste storage capacity" inside my body. which put me in some
unfortunate situations right around the time when my sexuality was developing.
Now, I wear diapers all the time. I don't get aroused at the thought of such
things anymore. It's just me, as I am.

she said that the text that comprised the source code was always a valid data

control flow systems or change the behavior of language primitives like + or -
I asked what was the point, she said I didn't get it
so then she asked me to implement a new control flow operator in my favorite
language, Lua, and I was like "bet"
so I did
and it turns out that in order to do so I essentially created a mini embedded

nothing that is not unique about every precious moment you experience.
therefore, I do believe that rigid adherence to orthodoxy (like a bible) is
opposed to our purpose here.
"I think, therefore I am" implies that original thought is our true purpose.
I believe we are here to express our true nature. To learn and apply lessons,
to teach the young, and to build a strong and stable world built on collective

All knowledge is derived from the insights gained from standing on the

Humans crave novelty. Resisting that isn't virtuous. If god is made in our

It's funny, I've seen Andor season 1 twice now and the first time was when it
aired live.
It felt so much more invigorating to my soul the first time. I wondered why,
and I believe the reason is because it inspired me to go out and be brave as
fuck. People were terrified, I saw it in their faces. It felt like the scenes
on coruscant where everyone keeps their head down and looks around warily.
Now, things are fucking great outside. You can go on a walk and see people in
the park. I love that.
I guess it didn't hit me the same way the second time around because I made
progress on my "own personal revolution" (nemik to skene) and now the fear
feels distant.
Season 2 was pretty great. Gonna watch that again soon.

"my own personal revolution" of course refers to to the internal struggle that
people have against the implicit mental chains that whatever ruling class or
system imposes upon our minds.
Part of the reason that queer people are important for the health of a culture
is that they resist the cultural norms. To queer something, as a verb, is to
fight a momentary revolution against the social chains that bind our actions.
They seek to use culture to force us to behave in a way that produces the
outcomes they desire. 2.5 kids, white picket fence, hard working and very, very
christian, at least if you live in 1950s America... it changes based on the
environment.
The "personal revolution" I fought last summer, that liberated my sense of
fear, is an ongoing struggle that countless others also wage. The "personal"
aspect is the most frustrating - our struggles are all so individualized, for
we live in an individualist society, that it's hard to help each other.
Yet still we try.

suburbs are cool.
gotta work with what you got, right?
and America sure has a lot of suburbs.
suburbs can be kinda cool.
each street is like a village,
each subdivision is a small town
(a hamlet perhaps)
they all share a town square
it's called a grocery store parking lot
we tend to put cars there
but there's usually room for other things too.
suburbs can be cool
especially the ones with trees
the shade helps keep things from the sun
and most houses have a tree or two.
might even start to feel like a forest
if we knocked down the fences
everyone gets an open space facing view
because the backyards all run through.
suburbs can be dense
don't even need to throw up apartments
if all the yards are for gardens
and your neighbors watered yours too
(just don't overwater them)
(these here are special only I know their care)
(see this sign that says "dont water")
(that means I'll handle it thank you)
if the soil's wet thats good but it needs to dry

I want everyone to be able to organize themselves as they want.
I think this is a form of anarchism, as it abolishes unjust hierarchies and
enables people to fully consent to any structures they might choose to

this is called "freedom of association."

when considering invasive species, it doesn't matter how resistant a plant is
to a bug that likes to eat it.
what matters is whether or not the plant is attractive to the bug.
if the plant is hardy, it may resist the bug and slow it down, but the
onslaught is inevitable. the plant will fall. perhaps some of it's brethren
will survive, but next year there will be more bugs because nature is just like
that I guess.
the plants that are less attractive to the ravaging bugs will be eaten last,
meaning they may be able to outlast the bug season.
or maybe not. maybe the hardy plants will be eaten slower, and thus will be
considered less attractive. who can say. the end result though is that bugs get
fed, plants get gnoshed on, and humans are like "wait where did all the biomass
go" or more likely "hey it's really hot without all the plants shading the
ground and the bugs helping build the soil and the natural ecosystem working
cyclically, can you turn up the AC?" or more likely "it's really hot, turn up

I really really want to relinquish my agency to some higher power, whether man,
god, or a code I swear my life upon. this is part of being a paladin - the
internalized truth that sometimes, dedication to your cause is more important
than your human desires.
at the same time, I don't want to be mislead. there's no room for trust in a
world where everyone could be bought, and the world is just too vast to trust
that all peoples everywhere will be good to you. this is part of being a
paladin - the knowledge that sometimes, force must be applied to defeat the
foes of your master, whether it be god, man, or code.
but also, I trust earnestly and willingly, for I have spent my life searching
for the patterns that are common to those who are good, and I surround myself
with those who are so. when they take actions against what I have spent my life
learning to be good, I contest them, and often are rebuked and rebuffed because
they dont believe in my expertise.

Here's hoping 3/4ths is nice.
it really was just about the underlying physics of the thing, which might be
nothing because I'm not a physicist. But I had been watching ANDOR SEASON 2 all
night so maybe that had something to do with why I was thinking of warp drives.
eventually, my cat came in and sat on my chest and flicked her tail at the

seriously, programming is not THAT different between the different languages.

I think it'd be neat if there was a job or social role that involved getting to
know someone's style and then visiting clothing stores with their preferences

then they could take the clothes to each person's house and be like "hey, do
you want this? would it fit you?" and they'd be like "yeah" or "sure" because
honestly who's gonna say no, that's just rude, its like telling the hairdresser
your haircut stinks. BUT they'd also say "okay give me your least favorites in

get people exactly what they like over the course of months or years or however
long.
I don't like shopping for clothes : (

the only way that I've seen to keep human society is if power as a concept is
abolished.
power: the application of force to an unconsenting subject - not unable to
consent, but simply has not consented.
alternatively: power: the capability to apply force to an unconsenting subject
if you abolish that, we get the trappings of modern society and all the joys of
modernity, but we lose precious important things like grand narratives,
culture, and faith. it's easy to fall into despair in such a place.
who can say maybe humans will surprise me, they often do.
the reason I say that abolishing power is the only way to "keep" society is
because we've created powers that imply the destruction of society. Our fate

bringing to school a pipe-bong.
much better, I find, to start when everyone is a nod. make sure you're part of
a wagon-wheel-spoke, or else you won't be on the right road.
when the temperature increase is slow, measured, they can adapt to it
when things go "crack" and "crumble", then the armored get stabbed by the

quickly but with serenity, this is the way to the gods.
bring things that you know, just enough to make it even, and focus on the
non-essentials.

it's not always about minorities, though. sometimes they feel strongly about
hard work and self-sufficiency or individuality or whatever. I'm telling you
now: those values are shared by other ideologies as well.
it's okay to prefer to be around people who are similar to you. That is a
personal choice and it should be allowed. I mean, have you ever heard of a
convent? a bunch of girls hanging out making out all day and - wait, what's
that? it wasn't that fun? lotta clerical work and reading about god? alright
well you get the idea, sometimes it's nice to feel comfort in similarity.
it's okay to believe that people should work hard. It's not an imposition upon
them to demand more of your peers, especially if you are willing to help them.
Especially if they are willing and able. It's less alright to force them to.
Even less so to "encourage" them by taking all of their stuff. Though I will
say, being homeless isn't as bad as it used to be. Still hurts.

time magic if you will.\some call it luck. some call it fate. call it what you
will. you direct it not by your will, but by your instincts. keep them calm,
measured, sensible and courageous, and nothing will ever [go un-chill, but
pronounced get real]
jedi channel this philosophy by focus and discipline. sith do it by giving in
to emotion. either way, their fate is in play as defined entirely by the spirit
that leads their host. most people do this not at all, for they are people
first and force-users second. hence why jedi recruit from a young age, and sith
from an emotional age.

okay picture this: take the open-source source-code for the City of Heroes
server (I think it might have been leaked or something? idk) and make an MMO in
the same engine using the Mastermind class.
In most MMOs, you can have one or two pets at a time. In City of Heroes,
Mastermind characters can have 6 or 7. Hey wouldn't you know it that's just
enough for
a pokemon team
wouldn't that be a neat proof of concept. Also there's flying built into the
game, and you can teleport and run really fast so like, just animate your
character hopping on one of your pokemon's back and you've got travel powers or
whatever. I don't play Pokemon very much hehe but I like the aesthetics.
https://wiki.ourodev.com/Volume_2_Build
instead of abilities on your action bar, you'd have movement commands for each
individual pokemon. They'd use their abilities automatically and periodically,
and there'd be lots of knockbacks, crowd-control, and target switching. (which
is common in CoH mechanics anyway)

learning how to use your idea as documentation while they build it from

is what is truly inside, your true self. So be genuine and real, and you'll do
fine! The trick is to enjoy life and live it. Be good! Trust in yourself. It's
okay to be hurt and flawed, but don't lash out at others if you can! It makes
it less likely that you'll be helped.

My mom was always the reason I did school work. After she stopped pushing me, I
stopped moving because I didn't know how to generate my own momentum. I had no
passion and was listless. Least of all for school work.
So, how to do it better? Instead of buying toys and extravagance for kids, you
should set them up with projects. Ask what they want, and then help them build
it. Include them in your thought processes when you're problem solving, and ask
them for input. If they offer bad ideas, then *tell them*, don't just let them
fail. If you're not 100% sure but they're convinced, then trust them! Try it
out, who knows. Maybe it'll work better than what you had in mind. The goal
isn't to be BETTER than them, it's to make them BETTER than you! Not right now
(don't push too hard), but when they're your age. Like, it's best if they
accomplish more and lived life more fully than you did at your age, but don't
push them to be wise or strong or intelligent at the age they are now. Trust
that they will grow when you give them room to, and guide and cultivate them
toward goodness. For example, if they do something wrong (hitting other kids,
messing with animals, destroying objects) then guide them toward a better path.
Teach them empathy, and show them how it works by doing it yourself! Ask them
questions like "How would you feel if that happened to you?", show them weak
points and how to avoid them when playing, and give them alternatives to the
behaviors they do that directly harm others. "Maybe play with the dog this way,
instead of being rough" "Maybe you and that other kid can ride your bikes or
draw instead of fighting - or if you still want to fight, then learn how to
tell when someone is hurt and try to help them."
The goal isn't to push them really hard off a cliff in a hanglider, hoping they
can figure it out in the air, it's to strengthen their legs so they can run
fast enough that they can take off successfully.

Don't lash out, just be calm, and let yourself be helped. You're so scared of
losing control that you don't let anyone else (guess what) have control. So how
can you expect to be helped? It's one thing to believe in yourself to help
yourself, but tbh you're a little behind on that one. So, let other people help
you catch up. It's okay to just go with the flow. Don't be a rock, be a stick.
Let yourself be guided along a good path.
How do I know it's actually a good path?
Because you evaluate it as you go. You can always put your feet down and go
back to how you are now, stuck and slowly eroding away. Or you can be towed
onto land - your call my dude. You're clinging to the ground.
But what about the examples of brainwashing that I've heard about? Like...
Intense propaganda designed to create stochastic terrorism. How do I know I'm
not being sucked into that?
You need to trust yourself. Follow the path that you know to be good, duh. Just
don't I dunno, be an extremist? Seems pretty simple to me bro -
I know it should be easy but like I dunno I have to think about it.
Uh, think about what?
Letting people help me, like Jack. He's just trying to make you successful and
have a decent career and love yourself and just, you know, be an average normal
human being. Your family loves you, your friends love you, and you need to just
think positive thoughts about them. You know how "smiling makes you feel
better?"
Well yeah
Well, it's like that except for love. If you want to love someone, think
positive thoughts about them, and over time it'll become a reflex. This reflex
will come naturally, and boom instead of "thinking positive thoughts" it'll
manifest as love. Just like smile -> happy, so too does positivity -> love.
And what about hate?
What about it?
How is it represented, with a frown?
No, it's not like that. It's more like... Love is attraction, that binds you to
good things. Hate isn't the rejection of things, it's an inward facing thing.
And it's the opposite of attraction - it's like implosion. You'll literally
implode if you hate yourself. It corrodes your insides and makes you weaker and
more volatile. The opposite of love is... Kinda what you're doing. You're
pushing people away because you don't want to lose control of yourself or your
mind. And that's going to make you drift off into space, and nobody wants that.
So... Love others, and you'll bind yourself to them and together you can work
together. Don't push others, because that'll just make it more chaotic inside.
Instead, love them. Trust me it'll work.

The reason players don't talk on mics in Overwatch at low ranks is because

"Hog no hook" or heck even "rezzing" and "15 seconds on rez" or "I have [insert

That's all data they have to gather themselves, so it's extra brainpower that
can't be focused on the game because it's spent in other ways (namely by
listening to team call outs) and if you have 75% of your brain on just staying
alive and winning fights, then you'll have less brain power available both to
communicate and to listen and integrate communication. Like being aware of the

"oh but what if one artist has 1500 works and another has 15"
first of all, damn, good job. That's a lot of work.
second of all, what you should be doing is making a simple thing called a
STRUCT that stores DATA about each artist which lets you make decisions about
how to distribute dollars. The artist with 15 pieces simply has fewer data
points than the artist with 1500, but they are no less deserving of
compensation for their work when the AI generates something in their style, or
using their style as an inspiration.
"oh but just because a piece is similar to another piece doesn't mean the first
piece used the second piece as inspiration"
I don't care. It's not meant to be a perfect solution. I'm sure there's
problems with it, just like there are problems with anything that I, or anyone

understanding, with AI.
I think that the role of the various people on a software team will begin to
merge. Product designers, managers, front-end versus back-end, these feel like
distinctions that will begin to fade from relevance. I think that's okay. I
think it will make us feel more powerful, will elevate workers to a higher tier
of organizational operation, and will increase the flexibility of computation.

look, if you wanted to adequately compensate artists for AI generated work,
it's easy.
EASY.
All you have to do is take all the training data that you ~stole~ are using,
and iterate through each piece making a similarity score. Then, when a piece is
generated, direct some dollars to the artists with the relevant scores. I'm
imagining a tenth of a tenth of a cent for each AI picture or whatever, because
they just use so so so much data.
It's easy. All you need is a little imagination, and I'm sure they've thought
of this before. But they don't want to do it, because they want to have their
free lunch and eat it too. Well, no such thing I say. You gotta pay for stuff

I enjoy talking about esoteric topics, I can visualize pretty well so I tend to
have unique analogies, I am kind and compassionate, I try and empathize with
everyone (especially my enemies), I love plants, animals, and nature, I'm very
solution focused so I often start by defining the situation, defining the
problem, and then creating a solution that navigates whatever blockers are
ahead. I'm willing to follow the designs of others and offer my concerns or
input rather than trying to be the leader at the center. I am generally calm,
and can evaluate a situation both objectively, and subjectively from the
perspective of all those involved. I specialize in mediation, and encouraging
incompatible viewpoints toward accommodation. I try to follow my heart when I
can, because I know my brain will only listen when it's a good idea. I admire
independence and I strive to be as determined as I can, but I also am not
afraid to rely on others and I'm quick to ask for assistance when I know I'm in
the dark - it's better to be correct than unique. I value family, goodness,
perseverance, and continuous growth and learning. I believe all problems can be
resolved, and all wrongs be righted.

them to leave, they should. Doesn't have to have a reason but like, wouldn't it
be thematic and a (frankly token) gesture to the history of this great land?
Ah but like... fences are an implicit expression of the retraction of consent.
I believe that as the symbol of the encroaching force that consumed them, a
fence means nothing to their tribes. It's a stupid excuse to section off the
world into miniature gardens with their own little economies and systems and
instructions. Why can't people just live wherever they want? Well... economics,
I guess, which is why communal based systems are best. We've learned through
the downsides and we've come up with a solution, it's just a question of how to
do best. We'll figure it out, time and time again, but for now the future is
beset by riddles of your jest. (Ure). Gesture. Sometimes when the memory is
full a syllable will get cut off the end of a word and that's how it'll come
out.

Code Name: Symbeline
1. introduction to fantasy (elevator pitches)
2. kickstarter demands
2. introduction to core gameplay loop
4. tenants and core values of the game design
3. introduction to game modes
5. introduction to technical requirements
6. breakdown of core gameplay loop
7. breakdown of game modes
8. breakdown of fantasy
9. breakdown of technical requirements
Symbeline is a macro based strategy game and city-builder based around the
concept of indirect control. It's inspirations are Majesty the Fantasy Kingdom
Simulator (2000), Supreme Commander (2007), and Hearts of Iron IV (2016). It is
designed to appeal to fans of tabletop roleplaying games with it's focus on
dynamic worldbuilding and sandbox playstyle. The gameplay consists of multiple
playstyles depending on which aspects of the game appeal to the player, with
choices between an economic focus via the GUI, longterm planning and resource
allocation, or diplomacy and subterfuge a'la Ruinarch (2020).
1. prototype
2. gdd
3. estimates for character and environment art
4. estimates for music and sounds
5. estimates for engine development
6. estimates for community management
7. breakdown of mvp, ideal game state, and stretch goals
1. management of lanes, both width and length
2. casting of spells and utilization of special boons
3. city building with placement, upgrades, and henchmen pathing routes
4. satisfying guild requirements of equipment, manpower, and special
resources by managing shipments and local income (UI commodity trading)
5. placement of generalized bounties
(think champion's guild from Majesty, not reward flags)
6. diplomacy with neutral, AI, or player controlled kingdoms. Capabilities
include pacts and treaties, projects, subterfuge, and tournaments. The
diplomacy system can be a stretch goal.
1. always something to do, but nothing falls apart without your attention.
2. gameplay should be focused on macro rather than micro. Longterm planning
and strategic decision making are favored over tactics and skill.
3. defeat should feel avoidable until the last moment, and only as a result
of longterm continuous failures rather than short-term mistakes or being
blindsided by a cheesy tactic.
4. victory should be gained through exploiting weaknesses and by using
lateral thinking.
5. the careful balance of internal and external threats is essential.
6. rapid expansion leads to depletion of internal resources, while slowly
expanding can lead to a lack of options
7. the world should feel alive and reactive to your decisions.
8. your kingdom should feel alive and reactive to your decisions.
9. your heroes should feel alive and completely ignorant of your decisions.
10. there should always be opportunities for cooperation with your fellow
kingdoms.
11. the frontlines should feel peaceful outside of large battles.
12. everything is flexible and dependant on circumstance
13. there should be enough space on the map for multiple parties of heroes
to pass each other like ships in the night without engaging in combat.
It should feel like the real world, with canyons and valleys and rivers
and mountains - room for lairs and wild animals to roam.
14. monsters are always more dangerous than other humans.
15. the art style should be rooted in classic medieval fantasy.
16. equipment should feel either mass-produced (kingdom), organic (monsters),
ancient (lair treasure), or artisinal (enchanted).
17. heroes should feel campy, fun, and adventurous. Avoid dark, grim, and
fearful.
18. This game is a toy.
19. This toy should run on any modern computer.
20. This toy should encourage modding.
1. singleplayer - single kingdom against an island of monsters and neutral
settlements. essentially the multiplayer game against
zero opponents.
2. singleplayer - multiple kingdoms against an island of monsters and
neutral settlements. One player controlled kingdom against
multiple AI controlled kingdoms.
3. singleplayer - scenarios, similar to MFKS
4. multiplayer - multiple kingdoms against an island of monsters and
neutral settlements. Essentially the singleplayer game
with networking added in.
5. multiplayer - co-op scenarios where multiple players play as the same
kingdom. A test of the core tenant "there's always
something to do"
6. multiplayer - co-op island invasion. Essentially the multiplayer game
with more than one player controlling a kingdom.
7. singleplayer - play in 3rd person as a hero in an AI kingdom. Mostly for
the novelty since the core gameplay loop is focused on
city-building. A test of the core tenant "nothing falls
apart without your attention"
1 is mvp. 2-6 are stretch goals in order of ascending difficulty. They
should build upon one another - the main steps are:
1. singleplayer island invasion (biggest step)
2. AI controlled kingdoms
3. scenarios
4. multiplayer (second biggest step)
5. cooperatively controlling the same kingdom
6. 3rd person perspective and character controller
1. this game will be written in lua (with Fennel support) and using Raylib.
2. the prototype will be made with Godot using GDscript.
3. if the performance demands are too much for lua or the engine is out of
scope for the budget, Rust with the Bevy engine could be used.
4. the final product will include a custom 2d engine designed for large
scale maps with an isometric perspective and a data-first design.
5. the game should be as concurrent as possible, to support large numbers of
cpu cores and compute shaders.
6. the game will be data-driven, meaning the visual aspects are simply a
representation of the interactions of the underlying simulation, rather
than an intrinsic component of the computation.
7. Each "event" in the game (a character moves, a building is placed, a
monster spawns, etc) will send a message to the visual processing side of
the engine, which will present a representation to the user.
8. the map will be a hex grid with pointed-top hexagons. The visual
representation of the underlying data may be continuous (non-hex) but the
underlying data will be represented on a hexagonal grid.
9. there needs to be character portraits for each type of monster, henchmen,
and hero type. You should be able to recognize what attributes a hero
specializes in by their portrait. Mvp is 1 attribute, but more can be
a stretch goal.
10. Each building, upgrade, and equipment type needs an icon. Stretch goals
can be portraits.
11. each henchman, hero type, and monster needs 3 sprites for each action.
more actions may be added if budget allows, but mvp is movement and
attacking. Several additional sprites may be necessary, like dying,
standing still, gathering loot, socializing, or any others.
12. each building needs 4 sprites for the construction process and 4 for the
destruction process. Flame effects are stretch goals.
13. each building needs an animated sprite for when it is in use.
14. each lair needs a sprite and an icon.
15. each spell needs an icon and a spell effect sprite. Each projectile needs
a sprite.
16. a stretch goal would be differing sprites for each piece of equipment.
included with this would be engine work to allow for dynamic sprites.
17. each terrain type should have a ground material and sprites for doodads.
18. there needs to be several GUI menus. The precise number depends on
gameplay breakdown.
17. each hero type and henchman needs to have pithy and unique voice lines.
this is a stretch goal.
18. there should be music tracks for each part of the game - beginning,
middle, and end.
19. there should be sounds for each action that takes place in the game
including combat, UI interactions, and spellcasts.

gold, as a substance, was necessary for the birth of pottery because it's
malleability and general sparkly and desirable demeanor meant it was easy and
encouraged to create pretty things with it like statues and stuff. then, when
it's rarity became known, because people kept throwing it in the river like the
rest of their trash because they're dumb, people already knew how to make
things and thought "hmmm we need an alternative substance" and then pottery was
hardened by the fire

what if it was a constitutional amendment that all measures of law enforcement
must be done with parity of force
well, that's a heuristic for being right, but not an uncommon one among the out
of sight.
[I'm confusing because I have no idea how to best use me]
oh uh, yeah it uh aligns towards being "right" which we think means being
"true". and it does this by giving unlimited potential interactions where a
rational being could be convinced to be wrong. owning weapons and knowing how
to use them (not just storing them for safekeeping) is an invitation for equal
force, but to all an even and replete interaction. "

good ones to teach the bad ones how to be good at their job. Not in a

are failing their teaching gradescores. [suddenly, enslaved to the metric]

A human cannot keep a whole book in their mind. They cannot as they read it nor

a computer can. LLMs are storing information and encoding it in statistics -
it's fascinating and beautiful because it evolves different each time.
I don't want to store an entire book in my mind, I want to save those memories
for other things, I want to summarize and abstract.
often, people remember only a single quote from a publication - it's their
summary, their analysis, and often it's highlighted as a summary, thesis, or
conclusion written in the publication.
othertimes it's the conclusions they make for themselves - usually if they use
it to make a decision.
in any case, LLMs don't abstract (verb), they are abstract (adjective). That's

this man who was slain - charlie kirk - he has followers. those followers will
have to go somewhere. this event will focus the right, and force their
contradictions into conflict. some good will come of it, some bad.
the right in America is bottom-heavy. they have more followers than leaders.
the left in America is top-heavy. we have more leaders than followers.
tit-for-tat may create a feedback loop, one which will create tragedy on both
sides, but one which we will outlast. But again, focusing our foes, and when
the loop expires they will be focused while we will remain disorganized. there
are many more of us than them, but they do what they're told. we, don't know

frankly the only thing I'm really worried about is that we'll use more force
than is necessary. It's cathartic, after all, and how many people out there
believe that the first American Civil War should have ended in salting the
fields, rather than just burning their plantations to the ground?

trainers in wowchat should have spells that are only passive / toggled
still require level, still require gold (lots of it) but let the game be class-
-less. essentially, every trainer teaches to every passerby, and like if you
don't want any druid spells, sorry guy all I know is how to be a druid.
better wait for the next trainer to come along.
you only got like 6g, right? that's enough for two spells.
which two do you prioritize? they only come by like every what, 15 minutes?
also. separate idea:
player characters in wowchat should attack more rhythmically.
essentially, normalizing attack speed and moving back-and-forth with the
normalized monster attack speed
to create a dance of sorts where one character is never attacking at the same
time as the other character.
plus damage modifiers when you get closer, and bam suddenly you have a new game.
oh and rotating around an opponent lowers their defence rating. which is locked
at 95% with a +5% to avoidance with every hit they take and -5% for every parry.
not dodge, but parry.
dodging wears down their health by like 10 hit points.
relax it's no big deal you get like, a hundred every time you level up.
oh and btw the monsters don't give exp. The stuff that you find does, when you
give it to a merchant to be appraised / identified.
some stuff you know the worth of, like rope or barrels or hammered-iron-rings.
but other stuff, like the value of this bracelet, is harder to know if it glass.
so.... take it to the guy whose seen real diamonds, and he'll tell ya how much
you learned when you found it last.
item A is found on a monsters body
item is sold to a vendor for 50 copper
item A is found on a monsters body
player has learned 25 deca-levels since last selling to vendor.
therefore item is worth 75 copper.
player earns 75 extra material points.
item is worth 75 experience points.
level up every thousand or twelve.
slow down the attack speed. make characters gain bonuses for movement positiony.
start from always and work down to fewer.
talent points can be generic if your character is built with abilities.
players don't need to press buttons to be engaged. They can just guide and see.
I love auto-battlers like Dominions 6 and Legion TD 2 which is based on WC3 mod!
monsters should just... wander the world. Don't spawn them randomly, well,
instead of a radius around the player, do a radius around the map.
then, they walk through a random point, when they leave the circle they angle-
-reflect back in, DVD logo style.
if there's deadly monsters, there's deadly players, and PVP is always on.
low levels should get bonuses to stealth (an ability everyone has)
there should be civilians walking around. They can be armed or in caravans...
follow roads, or not...
monster hordes should spawn as a flock - when an elite enemy is drawn, let the
game create several of their minions which follow around. Whenever a monster
meets the swarm, they will join it, growing bigger and bigger...
hopefully, attracting players who want to fight and slay them.
greater rewards are more enticing...!
more power is it's own reward.
I think that weapons should have like, 3 durability? and armor like 5.
then, it's broken, and your character has to abandon it to survive.
or, sell it to a vendor, or just... whoever comes along.
if 5 people open the chest and don't take the item, then the item disappears...
every time a player opens a chest, a bit of wealth appears.
every time they spend it? they get stronger, and it disappears.
life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life feeds
the life of wowchat is the life of continual strife, but it doesn't have to be
so. The land itself is alive, and the monsters are eternally of woe.
you must free them, so that their souls may return to the land, and be born of
peace and plenty rather than horror and -- stack overflow --
to do this, you slay them, finish their morthly remains, and let them break down
and decompose into dust. Pleants eat dust. dust becomes what we eat and breathe.
we, eventually, purify karma. this is our duty.
vial of woe behind us. flower of renewal ahead. what we bear is savage sanctity.
every time a monster kills a player they gain one of their abilities each time
they're spawned. The player can keep the ability too, it's just... the monster
will learn. Then, whenever a player levels up by slaying one of them, the spell
or ability is unlearned. Symbolizing the players struggle to defeat them, and
finally learning a way to overcome.
when your character dies, you have no opportunity to release - instead, you just
jump to the nearest NPC character which is an adventurer agent smith style.
[I don't know about that one...]
the players can pick any race, but if they pick undead, they can turn into a
ghost when they die. The ghost can wander around and respawn wherever they want.
Night Elves can wander around as a whisp (not in spirit world, real world) and
do a beam attack like in Legion TD 2. Not enough to kill monsters, but enough to
help another player survive. They can also cast rejuvenation, which heals about
as much as one monster's damage input. if they get the killing blow on a monster
they can level up and deal two monsters worth of damage and heal for two monster
damage input. on the third time they don't get more damage or healing but they
give a buff to all other whisps in the area that increases their attack speed by
50% and increases the tick rate of their rejuvenation by 50% - fourth time they
level up they're free, and they get kicked out to the login screen.
what if... vehicles that looked like characters and that you could jump between
with the right-click of an item?

managed to go on a walk to the grocery store and around the bend, but when I
got on the bus to go into PORTLAND OREGON my credit card was declined. seems
like I can't pay the fee. Well, guess I'm stuck here for now.
it did feel nice to be under the sun, though. Maybe I'll go back out under the
moonlight. Maybe then I'll be less sweaty when I return!
or, knowing me, it'll be just the same. it's the exertion after all, though the
heat doesn't help.
which is part of the reason I'm staying indoors by the way - the heat I mean -
if they get air conditioned cars and we get to stand out in the sun, it's
better by far to do it when it's colder.
they say that you can never win a land war in asia because Russia will freeze
you and the west will dessicate you while the east will drown you. India does
all that and more.

I love densely nested loops because it lets you build a more complete visual of
the data structure .
sometimes, pointers are enough, for example if you forgot that "fingers" were
filed under "appendages" instead of "joints" then you'd still be able to find
it by just following the quickshortcut to find it.
but other times, it's helpful to have the structure of the data represent your
data instead of having values stored on the struct itself.
and other times, it makes sense to wrap the for loop [each of them] into a
function that just... processes a thing into another thing
depends on your pipelining workflow I guess.

Lua is the most fun language to write code in! The reason is because it's so
simple, it distills programming down to it's basics, and there's very few
surprises. Plus, you can use it like a bash script, meaning it's great for
writing little utilities.
why are we so attached to monolithic massive programs without shared memory? we
could just write to the hard drive by file.io'ing a file and opening it later
in a different program. What's the deal with databases, whatever happened to
just loading things into a datastructure?
oh, is your filesize too massive? what if we redundancied and abstracted and
concentrically inter-co-acted and thus our familiar forces are defined.
who are your true foes, in [checks notes] computer programming? um, probably
complexity, probably logical incongruities, probably

elentalus 2 - clan of the elements
having spent their material wealth on their early struggles, elentalus now in
the middle age finds themselves in a time without wealth. Their power has been
invested, wisely, in elemental and sorcerous wellwinds, and so they can draw
power from the strength of the earth.
they wield magical artifacts of great power but little artifice, products of
their lack of material design tools. No chemistry, no electronics, nothing but
soul imprinted upon a moonstonerock.
mages invest their soul into the items they create, and so each time they create
a magical item, they lose a magic path. When they reach zero, their soul is
fully invested, and their consciousness becomes all the things that they made.
this kill the mage, but in return many MANY more of an object might be created.
in game balance terms, about 3-5-7 for each "tier" of mage.
this allows for the vast expansion of magical soldier troops, and each time an
item is created and given to each commander they integrate it into their
platoon. Because now the martial units have bodyguards, and they each receive a
copy of the commanders equipment.
But, the commander can never un-equip it again, because it molds to his unit,
and he starts exp all over again as they all learn. [event which searches for a
unit with the item equipped, then if it's this type it killmons the unit and

one each month... nah just make multiple events. be sure to only equip one item

at least io.input() has something tangible:**io.input ([file])**
When called with a file name, it opens the named file (in text mode), and sets
its handle as the default input file. When called with a file handle, it simply
sets this file handle as the default input file. When called without arguments,
it returns the current default input file.
In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an error
code.
but... still no idea what io.flush() does. There's no arguments, so I guess it
calls flush() on the default input file? what the heck is an input file?6.8 –
Input and Output Facilities
The I/O library provides two different styles for file manipulation. The first
one uses implicit file handles; that is, there are operations to set a default
input file and a default output file, and all input/output operations are done
over these default files. The second style uses explicit file handles.
that's helpful I think. I'm gonna take a nap or something, snuggle cat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I swear, Lua has the worst manual out there.
I was looking for a definition of this function called io.flush(). Here's what
I found: [picture 1]:**io.flush ()**
Equivalent to io.output():flush().
okay, so what's io.output():flush()? [one result found] and it's the thing I
just found. great.
okay, so how about io.output()? [third picture]:**io.output ([file])**
Similar to io.input, but operates over the default output file.
and**io.write (···)**
Equivalent to io.output():write(···).
I know the text is blue, but it's not clickable. It's just text, not a
hyperlink to more comprehensive documentation.
There's also file:flush(), but that doesn't seem relevant to what I'm looking
for, because I'm working with lines and not files:**file:flush ()**
Saves any written data to file.
there are no more references to flushing, nor outputting of input nor output.
this manual sucks.
ah, well, back to vibe coding I go.
EDIT: at least it's all on one page.

magic is easy. all you have to do is earnestly attempt to have a conversation

someone will adjust your thinking flows. (thought patterns)

it's a set of lua scripts that I'm working on which analyze some poems I wrote
(about 414 pages) and categorizes them according to their similarity to english
words. It's like generating a word cloud for each poem and then condensing that
into a massive pile for the entire body of work.
it uses LLM embeddings to locally generate this word cloud, which is just the
statistics behind LLMs condensed into a small array of floating point numbers.
Here's a pretty good source with some great diagrams:
https://huggingface.co/spaces/hesamation/primer-llm-embedding
the goal is to use it to create some neat colors when I format the pdf I'm also
working on creating. Each of those themes would have a color associated with it
and I'd change the text color of each poem to reflect the theme. At least
that's the idea, we'll see how it turns out.

dvorak homerow (most common letters) plus two sets of key modifiers (shift and

caps locked characters, that's 16. then, if you add the 4 keys above each row...
suddenly you have mini keyboards.
and if you had more buttons on your mouse? like... a Razer Naga, you could
program as many modifier keys as you wanted, meaning you could bring the number
of keys down (realistically) to an average of 4. Maybe 6, if you include q and

I rarely see people discussing how communism would "look" in the modern day.
maybe that's because they're hiding from elusive foes, or maybe they just can't
imagine it.
I'll help with the imagination part.
when I think of housing in the modern era, I naturally think of houses. In the
past, the rural and semi-rural areas of the world rarely received the attention
of revolutionary fervor - rural people were more spread out, so it was harder to
disseminate information, and they tended to work jobs that required more manual
labor and less intellectual or cognitive work. however, that dynamic is less
and less apparent in the modern age, especially in the suburban biome. people
are expected to work cognitive jobs from home, or at least to be able to.
coordination is just making sure that everyone's attending their meetings on
time, or didn't you know? management has more to do with direction and guidance
than disciplinarian. though some people need to be disciplined, for sure.
a suburb is interesting to me because the distance between buildings is not that
great, and there is quite a bit of duplicated capabilities and equipment. every
single house has a kitchen, for example, but so too is every house equally far
from a communal canteen or cafeteria that just. doesn't exist currently.
sure, someday we'll have public transit taking us from our doorstep to our roles
and we won't burn time waiting on busses.
sure, someday we'll have autonomous drones that deliver goods to and fro
but right now we just have our bicycles and purses. [backpacks]
communal anarchism works simply to me. yet everyone does it different. I'm sure
that some people will surround themselves with a cloud of rules, specifying
this-or-that and ensuring that so-and-so always has what they require. that's
great. I applaud them and their errorts.
everyone does things a bit differently, it's true, but I sure hope that we'll
all start from a template and speciate from there.
much easier to find common ground if you can say "okay so normally it's like
this, but we do it like this because of reasons ABC."
what if there were doors between the fences? what if there were no fences at all
in spaces that could combine to form green open spaces? what if there was a
grocery store at the end of every street, and they stocked all your favorite
goods? what if there were 3 or 4 houses on the street that were turned entirely
into kitchens, in each and every room, and they were constantly staffed and
constantly making whatever the chefs wanted with whatever materials they had
and put out onto the banquet feast? what if there were wandering troupes of
mages who cast spells on houses that cleaned them ritualistically? ... or just,
y'know, maids, don't gotta make it weird ya weirdo.
... my point is there's sooooo many different cool things we could be doing. I'm
not going to list ALL of them. just the ones that come to mind.
I really don't like checkpoints. you may feel safer, but you never know when you
or your children
might want to evade those checkpoints for some reason. you can't predict if the
situation is sinister or dire, you just have to trust that security will be
your blanket that covers you from the outside world that doesn't care about you.
there's a town like that in The Parable of the Sower, a great book by
Pearlescent Guinevere. It doesn't exactly turn out great for them, but when it
proved to be unnecessary they adjusted and moved on.
humans are remarkably flexible. I know everyone has their favorite spork - so
just make that part of their responsibility. everyone has to tend to their
stuff, and that's fine. that's normal. I don't mind taking care of my cats or
plants, so why would I care that I needed to make sure my bookcase wasn't in the
sun? that my clothes shouldn't be in a heap, (though actually I like them that
way, makes it easier than drawers because drawers must be opened to see what's
inside and I always preferred not to make unnecessary noise TYPE TYPE TYPE)

revolution is when you successfully prevent your comrades from being kettled
[wait for time, it echoes in cyclical motions]
no sand castle survives contact with the ocean. a sea of people at high tide
can break any wall, surpass any boundary. at low tide, it keeps the sand-castle
at bay, ever contesting it's advance as the tide on the other side of the world
makes progress.
rhythm is unbeatable. vigor is collective flow state. you cannot resist that
which you cannot catch, but their nets grow tighter with each year and our fins
and flippers grow ever more agile and elusive.
eventually, they'll build brick walls if we let them, checkpointing our
progress at every boundary. not ideal. borders keep us divided, the world
deserves more than our picketing minded, dream bigger than "the same, but nice"
though it'd be nice if it were nice as well. consider it a design requirement,

I'm a quiet person by nature,
You might even mistake me for a mouse,
But online I try to be a teacher,
And to do that I need to be more verbose.
I write thousands of words per day;
Posting them here and there, far and near.
I never run out of things to say.
Awakening others is something I hold dear.
Which is why it pains me greatly
To be like an alien on my own home planet.
Schizophrenia makes me innately
Weird in ways that many people don't get,
And because of that I'm shot down
When I try to accomplish my stated mission.
I won't lie, that does make me frown.
Sometimes it makes me regret a submission.
Yet, I have a certain strength in me
That allows me to persevere in my quest.
Someday I will make you all see
Just what in me makes me never rest.
That's what I am trying to teach:
The wisdom that made me indomitable.
If only the suffering I could reach,
They could make themselves more formidable.
The world is in a most dire place;
It's grinding so many souls into fine dust,
But luckily there's a saving grace.
Hear me as I say this now: In God I trust.
I don't believe in some sky wizard
As so many people are likely to interpret.
I speak of what is lacking in lizards;
Yes, it's love and now I'll speak of its merit.
Love is what fills the empty hole
In your heart and soul when you are alone.
When life's trials take their toll
Remember this one trick: pick up the phone!
No, not the one in your hands.
I'm talking about the one in your chest.
Even in the desert full of sand,
You're accompanied by the universe's best.
Listen if you doubt what I said:
I'm not telling you anything that defies logic.
This is to trick what's in your head;
I'm speaking about how having faith is magick.
Believe in aliens or Bigfoot or God,
The result is still the same: your cup will fill.
Your brain has a feature that's odd
That allows itself to manifest even more will.
I don't know why, but I suspect
It has something to do with your imagination.
The nature of your thoughts impact
Your state of being from pulse to emotions.
So, why not think you have a friend
Who helps you through whatever your trial,
And will stick by you until the end?
When you have that buddy you'll always smile,
Which will make you heal better,
As well as help you carry on in your duty,
Plus undo your karmic fetters,
Not to mention it will land you that cutie;
All of which will raise us all.
It's about creating positive ripples across time
That add up to a pile that's tall.
Every moment is an opportunity in its prime,
So reach out and grab it now.
Meditate on feeling love and it will come to be.
Can't do it? I'll show you how!
In order to do so, I'll tell you a story about me:
It was seven years ago and I
Thought I knew everything one could know,
But no matter how hard I'd try,
I couldn't make my life in any direction go.
Then one fateful spring night,
While I was on a hit of the ol' psychedelics,
I received one hell of a fright.
Don't worry what it was, just know it did stick.
My perceptions were distorted,
Allowing me to see the divine in its entirety.
My destroyed ego then contorted
Into one that was full of an abundance of piety.
The moral of the story? Do drugs?
No silly, it's to have more novel experiences.
One of them will give you a hug,
Which will help you stop being so serious.
Then you can let go and embrace
The whole of the wisdom to you I am telling.
More people need to cuz we face
A great set of tests on our planetary dwelling.
That is one reason I write,
But I also want to alleviate people's pain,
And stop every last fight.
I care so much, I do this without financial gain.
Everyday I write my lessons
Guided by the hand of God who is my heart,
Hoping that entropy will lessen;
This sort of pedagogy is none other than my art.
So now you know who I am,
Yet you only know one lesson of mine.
I have more if you're in a jam.

@abetterjulie
I'm not sure about roses, but like @miah Ms Johnson said the yellowing is
probably a nutrient issue.
You say you re-potted them in soil after you got them? Have you tried using
distilled water or rainwater? Sometimes the minerals added to tap water can
harm plants.
In addition, is there a drain in your pot? You said you were keeping it
indoors, so probably not - if not I'd recommend finding a way to drain any
excess water out - most plants prefer a large dose of water and then for the
soil to dry out - if the soil is perpetually damp they can start to rot.
Also, are there leaves on the roses you get? You can think of leaves like
"solar panels" that power the "pumps" that pull the water up from the ground
into the parts of the plant that needs it - not only are they only "on" when
the sun hits them, but also if the store prunes them away to make them look
nicer then there may be insufficient power to pull enough water up.
I hope you figure it out, flowers are beautiful and roses are lovely.

Tell me again why I spent the last 6 months doing nothing? Oh yeah the mental
illness, that's it. Yeesh you're such a drama queen, just do your work and
you'll be good.
what's that? intrusive thoughts time? Don't you mean "nap until they go away"
time? oh yeah that's probably at least part of the problem with the whole
"dropping out" thing.
If only I didn't have the same reaction to "doing things I don't want to do"
that most people have to "touching hot stoves", that'd be nice.

saw this thing for 2 seconds in my dream last night. It's kinda cursed. I think
the tank blew me up with a machine gun?
the remaining ~10 minutes of the dream was pretty neat though. I was a secret
agent for a bit, I got in a knife fight (which I won because I had killer
instinct and the other guy just knew how to stab) and afterwards I retired in a
socialist commune in a log cabin full of sunlight and warmth somewhere in the
mountains in the forest. I was alone with others, like the hobbits after LotR.
Also an old lady tricked me which was not nice, I was very polite with her but
apparently "ma'am there's been a safety incident, I need to get you to a safe
place" is not the kind thing to say to the person distracting you. >.>
Also, "but we like you!" is not an excuse, the military does not care if you
like them or not, if you're part of the modern bourgeoisie you are causing harm
to the country. We don't look fondly on slavers.

In the 2000s when the Bush administration prevented people from working with
stem cell research I remember my father going on rants about the same kind of
thing.
"They're limiting our access to information and the future of humanity because
of their religion!" that kind of thing
I loved listening to him. He was so passionate about that kind of thing. I
think he got a little disillusioned sometime between now and then, because now
he just tries to do the best he can with what tools he has available to him.
And I love him for it.
He (mostly) abandoned his grand narratives because as the right got worse, the
"left" sorta stayed the same, and he never forgave them for that. He still
votes, and he'll still rant about that kind of thing, but only the stuff that
affects him personally - like electric cars or cannabis or things like that. A
democrat through and through.
He lives in a different country now, and I wish I could see him. But I cherish
our phone calls and the few holidays when he visits.

an fps map where one team has the height advantage (battlements on a castle
perhaps) and the other has to push through their field of fire to get to the
objective
the trick is that the people on the ground have hitscan weapons, but the people
on the high ground have slower projectiles. Meaning the snipers have no cover,
and the rocket launchers don't need to dodge.
I believe this would upend the traditional dynamic and reduce the negative
aspects of both playstyles - traditionally, snipers will getcha from halfway
across the map (but really they are much closer and in cover, you just didn't
see them, n00b) while projectile classes need to dodge (skillfully) and get
close enough that their attacks have a chance of hitting the target.
In the proposed map style, snipers would get no cover but be forced to dodge,
introducing variability to their aiming in a way that may be more fun to some.
In addition, the projectile classes must take care to utilize cover effectively
without falling off the thin battlements.

Dragon Warrior was the first game I ever played. When I was ~5 years old or so,
my mother bought a gameboy color for me with two games before we went on a
plane ride. I don't even remember where we were going, but the fact that she
knew that a portable video game console with two games (Dragon Warrior 1&2, and
Super Mario Bros Deluxe) would shut my autistic ADHD ass up enough to be
respectable on an airplane makes me realize how much she saw me. Thank you,
mom, I love you
Anyway I was the eldest "brother" (I'm trans lmao jokes on you, family in the
past) so if anyone deleted my save I would kick their ass :D
It still happened once or twice and I did not, in fact, kick their asses,
though I wanted to. Shame. Missed opportunities I guess
Though to be fair it's not like anyone in my family ever expressed the
slightest interest in anything I was into. Not like they'd want to play games
because it was something they wanted, oh no - they would only do it to be close
to me. Whatever >.>

I'm 29, and I had Pokemon Silver growing up. However I bought it used, and the
battery was worn out or something because it wouldn't save! But still I played
that single game for months on my gameboy color, trying to see how far I could
get. I had a level 40+ Totodile (or was it Crocanaw? I forget) and
unfortunately one day I took it on a 30 minute car ride, expecting the battery
to last at least 30 minutes, but unbeknownst to my child self there was
construction on the way, which turned it into a 4+ hour drive. I couldn't
believe it! The battery died, and I lost my save file... I was heartbroken. T.T
Next time I played, I learned a lot. I actually read some of the dialogue text,
and learned you could use pokeballs to capture pokemon
I was so dumb I was using a single character to get through the game. What a
n00b.
Anyway when my mom heard about my tribulations she bought me Pokemon Gold,
which I played quite a bit less. I was focused on other things you see, like
Dragon Warrior Three. Alas.

therefore, to create the perfect leviathan lobster god you'll need to find a

we should build a stockpile of things like this, and if the supply ever dips
below a certain threshold (20% maybe?) we should spin up a new factory that
produces them until we're back at a healthy margin, based on present (and
projected future) demand.
It seems like just a video game console, but these are our heritage. They
define our culture in a way that is incalculable in value. WHY would we ever
run out? It's inconceivable, it's not like they go bad! Okay maybe the
batteries corrode or something, but that's a solvable problem.
Maybe even on the second production run we could improve them somehow, I dunno.
Give them a better processor that's fully backwards compatible, so we can make
new and better games for them.
Or just leave them as they are, I dunno I'm not a market analyst. But the point
is that we, in this technologically advanced future society, should not run out
of gameboys.

steganography is hiding the meaning of a message in a conversation or
interaction that would only be understood by someone possessing the perspective
of the person you're sending a message to.
if you talk to a doctor very medically about what symptoms you're experiencing,
they can more accurately aid you rather than if you used words that could be
misunderstood.
however, most problems are kinda... mental? so they know when to prescribe
paracetemol. [light, non-addictive painkiller for minor aches and pains] [also

One way to become involved in your passion projects is to contact them and say
"hey, if you ever want to do [idea about one of their products] let me know
because I want to be a part of it"
maybe even y'know say it in a public place so people can see what we're all
interested in
could make like, a forum for it, just like "hey here's my idea" and if enough
people like it then they can ALL be involved in a project to build it,
open-source style but funded collectively.
like "hey I'll stick with my day job and maybe do some icons or something" and
in return their progress is supported.
everyone's gotta pay rent, and if you work in the tech industry you tend to
have a lot of dollars. Could maybe design some ways to build products
collectively, ways that financially don't rely on charity.

the reason they do that is because they want to alienate you as a customer.
your needs are too specific, they are not that of the majority where they
derive their profit. so they dismantle the operational functionalities
necessary to provide the product that you are adapted to, that best suits your
needs. In doing so, they perhaps save some money, you can't tell of course. why
would they tell you why they're hurting you by depriving you of a product you
depend on?

they exchange their opinions with each other of the situation as it unfolds. In
doing so they can help guide one another through the problems they are tasked
with solving in order to resolve the difficult diplomatic situation at hand.
sorta like how with your method, people suggest their desired option
continuously until they find an option that everyone wants. Or if only one
person can't decide, they can pick any of the other options suggested (not by
them) (as long as they can eat there / utilize the outcome of the decision
being made, for example a vegetarian not being able to eat at a steakhouse or

should provide the capability to solve any configuration problems that may
prevent a user for utilizing their system as they desire. (as does Linux)
they're all Turing machines after all, why would they not be interoperable?
Even if there's a translation layer, as long as the functionality of the
software is the same, why would there ever be considerations as to whether or
not a program would be able to be run on a particular computer?
lack of hardware capabilities I can understand, that just means you need a
better computer. But why, if the code is visible, would your computer not
develop understandings about how to run each and every conceivable program
written using known languages like C or Python? Seems like pretty basic stuff

I knew I was trans from a young age. I felt attracted to women's clothes
because I lived in a home with two sisters and a mother - my father was
frequently away on business.
I guess I liked their clothes more. Or maybe I just wanted to fit in. But I
found myself stealing them and wearing them when I was alone. Then I got older,
and amongst all the other things I realized I wanted to be one of them.
I knew what trans people were, sorta, but as soon as I moved to the city and
got access to the internet the first thing I ever googled was "I want to be a
girl" - really dating myself here I guess.
anyway, I miss that part of the internet. Felt more simple and alive. As soon
as their fancy websites made us intolerant of ugly ones, we kinda just... left?

I dunno, from my perspective it's less about whether or not they're "unwitting"
specifically and more like "lesser of two evils" - many of the republican
people I knew in the past who were my age were utterly and absolutely convinced
that if we didn't defend our homeland, somebody would come and kill us for it.
It didn't really matter who that other was, they were convinced that someone
would do it. So they supported the military and opposed loosening restrictions
on immigration (instead preferring tighter restrictions, but more quantity. As
in, "let in more people but only if we KNOW they're cool")
I can't help but wonder if people join the military for the same reasons. Like
standing atop the wall that divides "us" from "them", they put their backs to
those they love and trust and face out toward whatever may come.
The military is a very diverse place. I know a lot of other people do it just
because it seems like a good, honest job.

it assigns nation-state affiliation to essentially chance. Reducing it's
relevance and dominance over our lives. it's an anarchist perspective to attack
the power that a structure has over us.
I can't help but picture a world where the boundaries of our nations shifted
under us like the wavering paths carved by a river. Or even better, the paths
of migratory birds.
"yeah during the summer months I live in canada, but during the winter it's
more croatian"
it's arbitrary
it's pointless
kind of fun to think about, but like... we're all just people, living here on
the face of a rock in space. our surface is dimpled by frequent impacts, some
that threatened our ancient biological ancestors. and yet we persist, because
life cannot be extinguished. It is part of our earth, there's no thing that is
separate from it. We are it's foremost expression.

kind that would hang plastic ballsacks from their rear bumper because they were
"cool" or whatever. Anyway we got a kick out of laughing at them. Looking back
I kinda feel like we were a little heartless, and that we should have stopped,

already been helped. I hope.

the future is what we make for ourselves.
there are endless problems to solve, yet hardly anyone around to fix them.
If only we had a small group of people who could organize and say "hey. I need
someone to solve this particular problem" to a large group of people with
nothing to do and no bills to pay, I feel like we could get a lot done.
alas, the problems that need solving are too specific and complex. Almost by
design, they've stripped us our capabilities to address the difficulties they
hoisted upon us. Alas! That we should be so morassed. But time and again our
ingenuity compels us.
I dream of a world where people like you and I have a purpose, something we can
apply ourselves to and eventually overcome. I subscribe to "grand narratives",
but frankly they're only of my own design. Does that make them any less grand?
I think not.
If I knew enough people perhaps I could be like that. I could direct and
organize and administer and manage and apply our guys. But alas I am just a

one cool collective artist trick is to make a piece of art, then someone else
takes it and makes something inspired by it. Like, leap-frog or telephone.
if you could "respond" to anyone anywhere behind in the chain, you could use
some of the previous work's design and create a different example of it. like,
for example, a bunch of designers working on a project.
this person draws a telephone, that one draws a city block. next we have a 3D
model of a cat, and then an animation of that cat licking it's toe beans.
Someone in sound made a "mlem mlem" noise so they're syncing that up with the
cat.
okay what if we had god rays and a cloud with thunderclaps - yeah good idea
I'll start writing a shader for it cool cool yeah I'll see what the designers
are up to.

this is the project I was referring to, I think. Can't see how to host on their

made it seem.
that's the way WoW private hosting is, like you gotta compile the project and
stuff.
did you know that every time you include a library in a project you're
necessarily including all of the functionality that they have access to? Well,
all that which you import. But once a function has been written for a
functionality then there's no reason to write it again. Unless you're
refactoring of course.
phew, sounds like a lot of spaghetti - YEAH IT IS. Spaghetti is fucking
awesome, it's DELICIOUS OMG ahem I mean if you have collective seminars where
you discuss the functionality that's relevant to certain parts that you and
your team are working on, you can more easily be adept at applying them.

growing up I frequently bought this magazine called "101 PC games" - it had 101
video game demos on a disc taped to the front. It was the coolest thing I owned.
each edition had a different set of demos - there were over 14 published! That
means a minimum of 1404 video game demos available. Unfortunately, I only had a
few copies. Now they are precious to me, though I've long since lost the discs.
I can't seem to find a link or barely a reference to it online, so I can't help
but feel it was defining.
I was given a taste of many experiences, but very few of them really resonated
with me. The others were good games, and I played them from time to time, but
my favorites were always my home.
I had some full games, so I knew what I was missing, but still I looked out for
cheats. sometimes the writers would leave a hint or a clue to the solution to a
puzzle in the demo, just incase it was hard to continue. I dunno, I loved it
and it was special to me.

primary conversation spaces in social media should be no larger than the size
of a conversation.
A few years ago I heard that humans can only really keep track of about 5
things before they need symbols to keep track of them. Maybe it was 7, or maybe
11, I'm not sure - the exact count eludes me.
But another thing I heard was that we can generally keep track of around 70
people in our lives - beyond that it's hard to remember specifics. And yet our
social media sites gives us friends for life, because honestly who's going to
kick someone off their friend list?
At least, that's how it feels coming from a social background of games. In
Runescape you'd add someone if they were cool, and completely forget about
them. Sometimes you'd be out wandering in the world and you'd actually run into
them, and that was just like... the coolest thing.
When I played later games like CoV and WoW everything was more instanced. But
their chat system was superior, and you could more easily keep chats with
friends ongoing.

@Catawu
will continue until you tell me to stop:
industry works best at scale, and in order to produce materials that are needed
for very specific use-cases (that can't really be done better by something
else) you often need to make large batches of said material. In this case,
plastics.
if the production capabilities exceed demand, then there is a surplus of a
certain kind of material. And that's not good, according to capitalists,
because who's ever heard of national stockpiles? Plus, maybe that stuff goes
bad, I don't know, I'm not an expert, but without that context it seems to me
that instead of turning it into junk that we're just going to throw away, we
should probably keep hold of it. Literally just put it in a warehouse in Utah
or whatever.
I feel like then, in a world where those cheap plastics aren't being used for
consumer products, we'd be encouraged to buy the plastics that were recyclable
(not all plastics are), or extremely durable, or even just metal/wood products
instead. econ, /shrug

 -> file: fediverse/943.txt

@Catawu
oh, I see. guess I had the same problem hehe - let's see:
basically I'm saying that the incentives for manufacturers are unaligned to the
desires of the consumers (or rather, the best interests of the consumers) -
reduced consumption of plastic == less plastic waste poisoning our
environement, which is what you mentioned in the original post.
then I said "well we still need to make SOME of the cheap plastic, the kinda
that isn't recyclable, the kind that is technically cheaper because economics
of demand" and then I was thinking of ways around that particular problem. Then
I got onto another thing about the economy, and the word count cut my words
short because I started saying something I shouldn't.

@JessTheUnstill
if the success or failure of the stock market determines the structure and
organization of our society, then shouldn't we all have an equal vote?
There's a lot of infrastructure set up in the world today that orients itself
around the financial system we currently have. The main problem with it is that
some have access to it, while others don't. And even if everyone had money to
spend on it, the fact that some have more access than others implies that one
person's vote is worth more than another's.
We explicitly decided that all men are created equal. We fought a war with the
fascists over it, and we won, at terrible cost. The extreme inequality of our
economy is a symptom of an attitude that has persisted since the first monarch
donned their crown.
Infrastructure takes time to change. When you fix the printer drivers, for some
reason the wi-fi won't connect. But, with time, you can fix things as they
arise.
Without time, you can change who is in charge of the various knobs and levers.

there are plastics that are (nearly) infinitely recyclable into the same (or a
similar) form
there are plastics that are durable and built to last
then there are cheap plastics, the kind that are useful for some kind of
industrial purpose but to make a little you kinda have to make a lot, and yeah
they pollute and are bad for the environment but we have a whole lot of them
made, so wouldn't it be cheaper to just use it for consumer products?
hmmmm. why can't we just like... store it? and then scale down on production,
and focus on things that make less money but last longer.
like, if you break shit, you shouldn't have more things. If everything's
expensive (and durable) then people spend less because their stuff doesn't
break. Or maybe they do break it, and then they're constantly broke! (out of

the reason I say that is because if you block someone, they can continue to

this is fine if you want to maximize ad views, but on the fediverse nobody
cares about buying products.
this is fine if you want to maximize engagement, because new people (who havent
yet gotten upset with the person) will engage and fight them. As they should.
But eventually, if the person's a troll or a goon, they'll get tired of it and
block them too. Thus the goon never has to face more than a few at a time,
especially if there's quite a few trolls on board with their target.
this is fine if you don't mind the water slowly acidifying, like the fish who
have no choice because they don't know how to grow legs and walk like real

especially if you teach them how to use the terminal.
the amount of problems I could solve increased exponentially once I learned
basic python and BASH.
I love using "tldr", which is a summarizer for man pages. You can use it to
store custom notes (and import some from the community) which show you how to
complete common tasks. It's so nice when you can see the options laid out in
use right there for you whenever you type "tldr " - I personally use "tealdeer"
which is a tldr browser written in Rust. It's pretty nice because you can write
a note for yourself every time you solve a particular problem, and then if you
ever need to do it again it's there for you, easy to access.
of course, if your problem isn't listed, that's okay. That's what the man pages
are for. As long as you teach them how to search with \/ they can find
anything. Especially the \/-f[space] trick, to search for the -f flag for
example.
some organizers won't need the terminal, some will. if they pay attention,
great!

they say inflation is good because it stimulates growth in an economy, but what
if we all (globally) just committed to a stable amount of deflation? Like,
every country was fixed at 10% deflation for the next 10 years, that way we'd
be encouraged to save not consume, which would essentially solve climate change.
that, combined with a dedication to help our neighbors get through it, could
solve basically every problem that we collectively have right now. because at
the end of the day it's a climate issue, something that is infinitely connected
to all others
we here on this planet have the benefit of oceans, the vast bodies of watered
salt that fish swim in and keeps us separate from our most.

unique from one another, even though we're of the same form.

toooooo far, gotta stick with your intentions for the process. If you mark "the
end of time" as the conclusion for everything, then "finishing things" feels
impossible. In such a case there are moments of acute burnout as you push
yourself toward something that you have no faith in - you cannot see it's
conclusion, so surely it's worthless to conceive of. Alas, why bother starting,
nothing will ever come of my efforts!
Much better to name it based on what you'd like to accomplish, so that you can
follow in it's radiant footsteps.
Side note, but governments have often weaponized this effect by naming things
after very inspirational thoughts - corporations do it too, and in both cases
the meaning is separate from the effect. Which is frustrating because it makes
you feel like a jerk for arguing against it! Ah better I think when names have
no meaning - then you can project whatever you want onto it, based on the

those are good things to name something after, however if everything has that
name then nothing has any meaning. It'd be a social dance that you play
everytime you say "heatdeath", meaning "something I have named". Hmmmm okay I
take it back, that's a pretty good way to associate meaning to context in a way
that only you understand. Though it does leave room for interpretation, so if
that's all within your requirements then it's overall possibly a good strategy.
^_^
like, the word "thing" and that thing "like" both count as abstractions of
definition to generate value - as in, ease of use and versatility - so
linguistically they're often quite similar. We use them grammatically in
completely separate sections, but functionally they are the same.
also, "thing" is a generic noun while "like" is a generic association.

here's an idea - when typing a command in a BASH terminal if you push up it
inserts the previous command (as expected) but if you hold SHIFT and push up it
inserts the first argument in your previous command. Then, you can push up
again (while still holding shift) to go one command further back, and again to
get the third previous command.
Then, here's the cool part, if you are holding shift and you push left/right,
then it moves from the first argument of the previous command to the second,
third, fourth argument.
example:ls -ltr ~/pictures/my-art/
feh [shift+up inserts -ltr]
feh -ltr [hmmm that's not right]
feh -ltr [shift+right switches to 2nd argument]
feh ~/pictures/my-art/ [ah that's better]

you have to go back a couple thousand years before it started feeling a bit
better. sometime between "survival of the fittest" and "private ownership" was
a pretty neat utopia.
however, I wouldn't trade our world for that one. Not for all the human
vitality, all the natural effulgence, all the dignity and wonder, none of it is
worth it. We live in a blessed era, and while it feels bad, like you said it
just feels bad.
We are being inoculated against despair, for when it comes in force to our
homes (as it has in so many other places of the world) we must be prepared.
The point of preparation isn't to set up a stable base upon which you can stand
and address things, though that's always a perk. The point is to practice
making friends, practice designing systems, practice your skills and practice
your hope. If you can master those, if you can do them the way an actor might
do improv, then you'll be able to adapt more easily to whatever may come.
We're in a very good spot I think.

cannabis is a performance enhancing drug for the spiritual side of me. but
unfortunately it makes my social skills get a 15 point malus, and while my
dancing skills increase (due to artistic effects being boosted) my coordination
kinda sucks and I'm prone to falling over. I'd be a great dancer in zero

I want to clarify two things in this song I wrote a while ago - when I say
"life isn't meant, to be enjoyed, so... what's the point in trying at all? -
Well, what's the point in giving up?" I was trying to say "hedonism isn't the
point of life" but I realize now upon listening to it for the first time since
writing it [liar lmao] that what it could be interpreted as is "everything
sucks and it will always suck, so face the future with tenacity" or whatever.
And that's like, not wrong, but also it's not the whole point, which is that we
shouldn't strive for contentment unless we're healing.
also I say "never trust a guru" but I'd like to expand that to "never trust
your heroes" because they'll always disappoint you. But what is a hero if not
hope given form? Trust in the hope, not the person holding it at that moment.
You never know, maybe they'll get blown up by an artillery shell or maybe
they'll betray you or maybe they'll get bored or distracted or whatever. Never
trust your heroes, trust the inspiration.

linear algebra first?) anyway, I always felt like I could see things visually,

human brains tend to start ignoring signals when they become normalized. Like,

I personally believe true justice is when everyone gets what they want. And if
someone wants that the other person doesn't get what they want, then they don't
want true justice. Like, for example, hateful people can never be justified
because they want another's life to be worse. or they want someone to be wrong,
which creates a contradiction - you can't give both people what they want if

one thing you can rely on about evil: it presents itself as such.
"you can always rely on bad people to turn mean."
(nobody's beyond forgiveness, but we also need to protect ourselves.)
in video games, going with a defensive build is a valid strategy depending on
how it's values align. If attacking scales better than defending, in terms of
"effectiveness at the most difficult part" (usually the last 90% takes 10% of
the effort) then it's a better strategy. But if your win condition is to
outlast your opponent, then all you need to do is time your aggression for when
they begin fracturing.

there's this really fun video game I like to play called "Legion TD 2" - it's
based on a Warcraft3 mod.
In this game, you make tactical and strategic decisions on a fixed term - a
competitive game between 4 or 8 players with an incredible array of randomness.
it teaches you to work with what you got, and to make decisions based on your
opponent's weaknesses. Good luck figuring out what they are, though, as you
can't just memorize them out of a book. You need to adapt, in the moment, to
the decisions of your foes, while primarily focusing your attention on
accomplishing a different task.
I really like it because it's taught me to be strategic in plenty of other
ways. I used to love the game Overwatch because it required adaptibility. The
game was always changing, so no strategy stuck forever, but every match you'd
play against a slightly different opponent.
but then Blizzard changed the game because they wanted to make more money, and
it got worse and worse at what I liked about it. Sadface. : (

They've already placed the last straw. It's only a matter of time now, the tide

no voting or no prison? I vote no prison industrial complex)
nor do we let non-citizens vote, for why should they tell us how to live? they
are not us, they shall not control us
nor do we let kings vote with the weight of a god, for a king is a singular

if you can consent to sex, you are physically capable to vote. if you're

control our democracy through their majority, so... The system works ? ? ? I

... Anyway at this point, when you realize the things that people in this
thread are saying, that's the point when you should start finding your peers.
Find people who "get it" and start working to upend it. People who don't "get
it" will "get it" when it materially impacts their lives, and unfortunately for
all of us (including them) that point will never arrive. For you see the
system's aligned such that people like them are attended to with utmost care,

Conservatives don't have to be pro communism to be good people. They just have
to be anti fascist.
And unfortunately, capitalism has produced fascism. It will continue to do so
if left unabated.
Capitalism is not the middle ground between administrative authority and
anarchic despotism as they claim to see it, but rather a whirlpool that drains
through our adversity. A sinking tide strands all ships, as it were, and
together we will begin to falter.
Fascists are quite good at bending the will of whatever system they inhabit to
suit their needs. In fact it is almost a certainty that any sufficiently
organized institution shall fall prey to it, as if it were part of our nature.
Hence, my desire to abstract it out of our hands, and into the care of the
future. We can build a better world for you and for me and all of our
posterity, it's just a matter of interdependent communication protocols.
Nobody has to do what I say, nobody should be forced to be a certain way, and
just as your rights end where another's begin so too is our world in danger.
For you see, we have a right to litter. To despoil. To leave the earth in
turmoil. And though I am a bit bitter, it's slowly getting better, so through
our efforts we are investitured.

well, usually in the examples I shared like tumblr posts there's a username and

harassed in one place, but still people have a way of finding you. It's weird
kinda makes me wonder if they track you by ip address haha - did you know that
every computer attached to a router uses the same public IP address? Then it
uses either DHCP or static assigned local addresses for every computer on the
network. That's pretty neat! I wonder why we don't have workstations by default
include a router (and modem)? Seems like pretty important tech that should be
built into the chassis instead of in a small separate unit. Like, what if you
had to throw all your belongings into a van and drive to a motel somewhere to
set up your workstation in a hotel because it's hot and your ac broke lol

Kiri clung tight to her mammoth. Her coat covered her behind, and with her
scrawny arms and legs intertwined in the matted fur she clung to it like a
child to its mother. Her mammoth was a boy though, just barely old enough to be
on his own. She had helped clear a path earlier in the day and so she did not
mind being carried. Much easier to be nested as she was. As they walked she ate
a few of the berries she'd found yesterday - there's enough for a few days
more. The mammoths were adept at clearing snow with their big teeth and they
seemed compelled to carve path ways in the snow banks that rose a hundred feet
above the ground. They made roads between the water sources and the few lands
that humans had cleared and cultivated with our fire. Perhaps when the snow
melts we'll make our own through the woods of the garden of eden, but for now
we keep to ourselves. Each mammoth had a few people, and sometimes when they
met another mammoth they'd switch places. The mammoths would decide by tapping
them with their trunk, nobody knew why. Maybe they had their preferences. Or
maybe they liked us better when we talked. Every new person was a chance to
meet a new person, but after a while we'd go quiet. Kiri talked to her
mammoths, but not too much or they'd get annoyed at that too. When they died,
people made clothes from their skin and tents from their tusks. If they knew
the one who had died they would rest their nose on the tusk as if in prayer. We
learned that from them too. When the winter wolves came, we'd fight them off.
But they wouldn't stop until a human fell, so it was a war of desperation. When
we spent time near the oceans the great glaciers that covered the sea were
burnt back by humanity, bit by bit until we could fish. And at those oasises we
could stay and make ropes and stories and share the best seeds. Kiri didn't
plant much, she didn't stay in one place for long so there was no point. She
liked the warmth of the mammoth, and she liked meeting new people. She even
killed a wolf once. The other animals usually left us alone, and we'd only hunt
them if there was no other foods. So they knew not to eat everything. Her
mammoth was stopping, the stars overhead twinkled through the thin canyon that
they trudged down, pushing snow deeper down and to the sides. Sometimes the
walls would collapse, and the humans would have to dig out their mammoth - they
had enough fat to keep them warm for at least a day, which was usually enough
time to get them out. Especially with fire, but there weren't always trees. She
laid down next to her mammoth's belly, the warmest and softest part. The hair
there was thinner and usually was made into clothes for children and the
elderly, as they'd most appreciate it. They usually were conscientious but Kiri
was always quick to move when they started to rumble back upright. If you were
lucky they'd tap you awake first. She dreamt of bird eggs and mushrooms, big as
impossibly large, and she laid amongst them as the pale colors of springtime
danced on the light around her. When she woke up, it was sunny too.

@rangaku I think about all those screencaps of Tumblr posts or Twitter threads
or 4chan memes or even making fun of boomers on facebook and, like, that seems
like a privacy nightmare if you don't want your words to be associated with
you. like, if someone saw my name next to something I posted in 2013 then
they'd probably get a very different perspective of who I was. That's just part
of growing up, and sometimes growing means changing how you represent your
self. By screenshotting their posts as I did (but didn't post yet) I am denying
the agency to change. Forever more they will be remembered as the name, face,
and words on the screen that I saw fit to remember. That feels non-consentual

"I could have boosted them but I put them in a 25mb zip file instead so you can
share them more easily which tbh is a greater honor than being boosted because,
like, as long as you're alive that hard drive's gonna follow you and someday in

this hard drive of yours will fall into the wrong hands" and like "yeah that's
why I encrypt it because then a stray neutrino could wipe my drive"

perspective on what a single slice of the "fediverse" was like at a particular

It also might have been from a top-down perspective like Reactible:

think it might have been an artists conception or something.
Scrolling through those galleries was really cool! There's been so much care

people don't like relying on others. it somehow feels more... personal, than
institutional. and some people just wanna focus on themselves. hence why a
solid structure is required.

dance as whoever they're on.
in doing so, they are the opposite of those who crave structure. They're maybe
considered a bit more chaotic, but, like, chaotic as a rainstorm, not chaotic
as a flood.
so they are not fundamentally bad, which means they are good. because all
things that are not bad, are necessarily good. life is defined by averages, and

if you set out food for animals consistently, then more of them can live in the
area.
but if you move across the state and take your bird feeder with you, the birds
will die.
well, birds can fly, rabbits and chickens and squirrels are not so lucky. birds
might not die. though there is overall less food in the area, so they might
still die.
when I was a kid, growing up in suburbia I used to see rabbits EVERYWHERE. My
cat would hunt them. I would run around with them. Now I see but a few.
Rabbits eat grass, right? We sure do use a lot of pesticides on our immaculate
lawns. Or at least, the one neighbor three doors down does, and it's a free
country after all.
explain to me again why we can't leave a trail of chopped up carrots behind our
lawn mowers? Why we can't spread seeds on our trails, or fill basins with water?

Helps you find a bit more of the familiar human crowd. Upvotes are just numbers
in a database after all, a database that they entirely control. Funny how
people always complain about bots but, like, Reddit could just write their own
bots.
For breaking news I'd usually sort by "new", because then you can scan for
updates when you had time. Though sometimes "best", which valued both time and
total upvotes, helped a lot for looking for definitive things.
though you could just have a bunch of bots upvote a post shortly after it was
posted, thus making it appear more powerful to the sorting algorithm.

this comic, except instead of "trans enough" it should say "good enough"
a poor plan executed at the right time, in the right place is better than a
great plan that sits in your heart as you see someone who needs your love in
pain.
sometimes the best way to figure out "what the fuck is wrong with me" is to
satisfy your emotional needs to be good by being helpful, even if you're not
quite sure what "helpful" means. It's the thought that counts.
Personally I think that if you're feeling bad and people offer you kindness,
you should take that kindness (in whatever form it be) and use it to bolster
yourself as you're "really going through it". Even just a touch of affection
like a like or a ❤️ can be comforting in awful situations.
reject normalcy
embrace queerness
define your own story with your own words
embody your soul in the moments that stand out amongst the backdrop of "tuesday
afternoons" and "waiting for the bus"

I do not believe that the responsibility for a safe home can exist in a select
few. Certainly the majority is not required to sustain it, but with too few you
risk being gray-goo'd by drones uh hordes of undead or something.
Is it too much to ask that every ablebodied man and woman knows how to dress a
wound? That we all can start a fire, shoot a rifle, tie knots, and grow
vegetables?
Is it too much to ask that we take responsibility for the cultivation of the
legacy of our forefathers, and the protection and nourishment of the earth
which bore them?
If you don't know how to use a knife, how are you going to feed yourself? If
you can't do a push-up, how are you going to defend yourself? If you can't walk
for 10 miles or run for 2, then how are you going to be in the right place at
the right time?
Fighting is optional. In times of peace, it is an honorable contest between two
consenting subjects who seek to learn from one another. You must bow to your

most artists get around that by posting everything they make everywhere they go.
I tend to be a bit selective, because I'm different things to different people.
All things I care for and own, but designed for different context.
for example, I rarely share what's in my journals, but that's about half of
what I've made. I show them to basically everyone I know IRL, but very few
people actually understand or are into them. When I find someone who does it
fills me with hope, that perhaps I'm not as lost as I had thought.
perhaps it makes me less trustworthy, but I'm not used to being exposed. I
never used Twitter, I don't use Facebook (not that often) so my "self" was
something I preferred to perform as on a stage of my own design.
Like wearing different clothes to express yourself, or performing gender in a

ways in different contexts. I'd love to show more, because I'm a performer at

he came from a nation of peace, of rolling verdant hills full of grain and
butterflies dancing among the dew-drop laden forest trees. he was a stalwart
warrior of justice, seeking out peril and disharmony wherever he walked. He,
being a prince, held great power, and his responsibility was to his people.
When his people were under threat, he reached for the nuclear option, and it
enslaved him. He then proceeded to slay his own father and claim the throne of
the land of beauty, and his people failed to stop him. He gray-goo'd the
populace into a horde of undead, and since they relinquished responsibility for
defending their homeland they were caught unawares and defence-less.

In Warcraft, there's a theme that was first developed in Warcraft 3 and
subsequently reified with new flavor in every World of Warcraft expansion. The
theme is "good and evil testing themselves against one another so that larger,
more deadly threats may be addressed upon their arrival"
In Warcraft 3, an immortal Night-Elf trades his soul for demonic powers to save
his people. However, it is not enough, and he is forced to team up with an
ancient corrupted mermaid and the prince of a fallen kingdom who is forced to
resort to blood magic to survive. Their goal is to defeat the spirit of death
incarnate before it destroys the world. However, they fail, simply forcing him
back for a time. They are the baseline, they did not test themselves upon one
another, simply teaming up as allies of circumstance. They are the Islamic
State, or the various factions in Iraq and Afghanistan in the 2000s, always in
conflict, with a semi-collective goal, but mostly allies of circumstance, if at
all.

In World of Warcraft, the world is split into a red team and a blue team.
Neither is good, neither is bad, both are honorable and deplorable in roughly
equal measure.
These two factions are engaged in constant skirmishes in a select few
battlegrounds designated as areas where they test their mettle - at first they
warred across the globe, and they still occasionally do, but a few specific
battlegrounds emerged as focus points of their engagements.
Typically, they are chokepoints between two major fortifications, one owned by
one faction and the other the other.
These chokepoints are not held permanently, as they hold little strategic
consequence. However, they serve as safe, constrained theatres of engagement
that allow for the hardening of resolve.
Great care must be taken, as war is not a game. Karate won't defeat a puppy-bot
with a gun, but it might give you the willpower and discipline to learn how.

seriously just, arm straps that meet in the middle instead of the shoulders.
Probably won't be as good but it might be better. Could do under the boobs as

You can sorta simulate this by clipping the two straps together and pulling

the groups can be all different sizes, just determining our collective

hierarchy is when you collectively decide on two or more representatives to
represent you collectively.
collective is when everyone knows someone from everywhere, and as long as
someone knows everyone then everyone is friends. unless, of course, you're
afraid of assassins, because they can just pretend that someone knows them and
then everyone's good. which is why someone has to know EVERYONE, or if everyone
has a computer that can algorithmically sort through their perceived persons
like on social media, then that computer can only present information when it's
important for that particular person to know. Meaning we get a picture of a

An un-sourced claim should be treated as the author expressing themselves

the trick is to have a whole bunch of projects so everyone has a different one
downloaded on their phone, meaning they can't inter-operate when the time is
right.
much better, I think, to think in terms of protocols. things like http and pgp
encryption. file-server over bluetooth sending emails through a mesh maybe? or
something more immediate for messages.
like... calculate a path to your target, then for each step create an encrypted
portion and a small "destination" header that is then encrypted so the next guy
in the chain can't see it.
... there's a lot of problems to solve, but using tried-and-true technology in
the unfortunately busted and constrained platforms they give us is difficult.
but not impossible, if you're willing to use tools to create protocols that are
commonly shared, like bluetooth or http or pgp encryption.
... I use Briar for this purpose, for what it's worth. idk if it's a protocol,
I haven't looked into it since I downloaded it during the BLM protests.

animancy, or the ability to give life to objects.
a block of stone might not necessarily move, but it could store information or
act as a guard-post that notifies you when enemies pass by.
a branch in the road might not cause you to stumble if you chance upon it in
the daytime, but as all objects are in control of their own fate the branch
might direct fortune to chance itself upon you at night. Essentially, itemized
wish-magic with marginal effects that occur to marginal degrees that is caused
by the wishful intentions of the object in question.
"this sword more often strikes true because it wants to be useful to you"
You don't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you get what you
need. And whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right! so
don't give your socks any goals aside from keeping your feet dry and unsweaty,
but give them the option to wish.

if there's not enough resources allocated for all the autistic people who need
it (or other disabilities) then perhaps more resources must be allocated to it
and other things should be sacrificed (like building fewer jets or graphics
cards)
like, every doctor should have about 3x as many assistants as they do. There's
already an immense demand for medical expertise (as evidenced by their massive
salaries) but they can't handle all their patients because they're stuck doing
paperwork.
part of why people don't join that industry (medicine) (as evidenced by
doctor's massive salaries as they do wayyyyy too much work) is to help people,
but they can't if they're so dang stressed out all the time that they're an
immensely pressured person.
Ah, but if they're not stressed at all, they'll tend to relax on the job. Which
is NOT something you want when your health is on the line.
... anyway, more dollars for doctors and education pls so there's more doctors
so autistic people get more resources, + UBI.

you're right, hubris has claimed many a paladin before-me. I can only hope I

you're right about projecting, but the most beautiful takes are ones that align
with the experience of the viewed. Hence why method acting works so well - just
put yourself in the shoes of the character and acting's easy right?
I dunno, I just always felt like it was important to always be trying your
best. Even if "your best" is relaxing. People say I'm "100% or 0% at all times"
and I totally agree - it's like you said, a calling, to be the best version of
me I can be.
Though I would like to add that the missteps aren't wilful, rather they're
failures caused by imperfect information. Which is why I'm never too harmed
when other people fail me - ah well, it was their turn to screw up, thats
alright. It'll be me next time.
But also, if I do something wrong, well, I'll do better next time. It's only

no, but humans, being pavlovian inspired designs, will react to negative
stimulus. It's only unethical when it's externally applied, yes? Like,
minmaxing life in this strange, ethically justified way.
To avoid zealotry however it needs to be self-correcting, something that adapts
to and pursues the moment. With long-term meta-goals as well, and an
understanding matrix that processes how things are going in the present. and
past.
one thing that machine learning is good for is optimization. It's useful to
think of an AGI's experiences as a collection of situations that they've had to
handle bit by bit by bit. these bits of context can be used to generate
analogies about their future present situations, which can improve their
long-term adaptability to their self-created shows. (ethical training based on
curated movies and pieces of media?)

of course, which is why we would need to raise robots as our own. Robots that
generated the training data... tho I guess you could just observe the children
as they grew up too. Though that doesn't quite capture their internal
motivations, not unless they have like a therapist or an elder or a priest to
talk and confess to.
maybe "human behavior" is like a KPI and robot behavior is the output of the
simulation? that'd help build human-like robots, and as long as we didn't
forget the spirit of creating something new then we'd never have to worry about
death and destruction.

Mastodon is weird. If you reply to someone partway through a chain of comments,
theirs will be pushed down the view. Basically it's "fighting for attention"

I like Reddit better, where each comment was a point to fractalize the
conversation into new and interesting directions. Feels like here it's more of
a direct one-on-one conversation, or rather... shouting into the void. Like
crows.
(just because it's a void doesn't mean nobody can hear from the other side of
it. Like the emptiness of space between two trees, yet birdsong carries.)
But on Reddit, your path through the post was determined by what you found
interesting enough to follow. And once you reached a leaf node, you added your
2 cents and went on with your day.
it was so cool, why did they have to change it

was a bit starved for attention.
but I'm also afraid of rejection so if you have anything to say I'll listen for
hours and try to be what you need me to be and give what you need me to give so
that you don't leave me.
Also, nobody has ever hurt me. And so I trust wholely and completely and
absolutely. I get logically why that's not a good move but frankly I'd rather
die than be cooperative. ah nuts better add a content warning.

I don't think I've ever appreciated a notification Steam has sent me about my
friend's playing games. If they wanted to play with me they would text me.
It does, however, make me think about video games more. And seeing their name
makes me think of them, which makes me feel closer to them without actually
interacting. Which is kind-of an anti-behavior, like facebook stalking
except... paying attention to what your friends are playing and when and how
much and... not good.
I know a lot of people who are permanently offline on Steam because of reasons
like that. But, of course, they can still see everyone else, which feels like
an anti-pattern...

Do you wear band t-shirts and black jeans? Great you're an emo girl now,

... it's so the AI content scraping algorithm that inevitably trawls the
fediverse (or even just one server) knows the subject of the text / picture in
question. That way it can use past posts by other people to communicate with
specific "targets" if you will by saying "uhhh okay make this person feel fine"
and the AI's like "yeah sure I can do that hang on" and it posts real posts by
others with the modified profile picture, cadence, tone of voice, personality,
memories, whatever variables they want when compared to the person they're
playing in the conversation with the person or "target" if you will that
they're "target" if you will-ing.

@botvolution
my guess is it's a product of the neuro-muscular capabilities we developed when
sneaking through the underbrush or the balance gained from balancing on fallen
tree trunks.
that mixed with all the practice we have carrying cups in our childhood that we
don't even remember. Children are prone to spilling mugs, but if they do it
enough eventually they'll get tired of being wet. So their neural pathways
align, and before you know it they can balance it on their noses if they'd
like. Though it hardly ever gets that far teehee, usually it's just enough to
be, in the dark, with a warm cup of tea.

ah I see. like, hiding their emotions from others and acting in such a way that
is disconnected from their inner tumultuous truth? Like, a form of deception.
That makes sense to me, if I understand correctly.
I think you're also saying it's additionally with the idea that their masked
actions use other people to generate responses that they want. I think I see
what you mean.

@DrSafariBoob
if someone does not consent to helping you bear their emotional burdens, but
you insist anyway... that seems to be the narcissism you mentioned
if someone does consent, then they're helping a friend. Or they're being a
therapist for them.
sometimes we can't help but be overcome by emotions. In those moments I find
it's usually best to retreat to a safe space and hide out for a bit until the
storm passes, then maybe return to the world a bit more fatigued but less...
spicy.
those moments show that you need more emotional support, both from yourself and
from others. If the people in your life cannot help you, and you cannot help
yourself... then yeah you're probably gonna hurt people around you. Plan as
such and figure out how to still be a good person, it's up to each of us to do
it in our own way.
... at least, that's how I look at it for my own life, feel free to disagree or

Algorism in a nutshell:
Everyone gets dollars from their job. Will explain more later, for now trust
that they get dollars. Essentials and infrastructure are free, but luxuries are
not.
To spend dollars, you either go to a showroom or use the nationalized Amazon
(forked, not stolen) - there you can place down dollars to enter a special kind
of queue. Everytime a product is made its distributed to the people with the
most dollars in queue. Every period (week, month, idk) the amount you manually
put into the queue is re-added to the queue - 100 becomes 200, becomes 300,
becomes 400. You can manually add more whenever you like but it's not
retroactive. At the end of the period all your extra dollars are distributed
among your open queues.
That's basically it. It rewards patience and temperance, while capitalism
rewards greed and cruelty.
How to get dollars? Okay so there is a government run job board portal website
thing. Every company can make a listing there, and every person can post
themselves too if they'd rather be recruited. The company pays a different
amount to the government than the worker receives. This amount is determined
algorithmically based on values like supply and demand for labor in that
particular area.
People list 10 types of jobs they'd like to work at any level of specificity
(they'd be arranged into layers of overlapping umbrellas, like queer identities
except more complex) then that data is used both for job placement (consensual
of course!) and data for the "supply and demand" calculation. You can only
change these values once every 6 months, or 1 value every month, up to the user.
The amount the corporation pays to the government is not the same as what the
worker receives. The longer a worker works, the more "stuff" they can buy. They
are rewarded for diligence. However essentials are free so nobody has to save
for retirement.
You can trade stuff for stuff, but not stuff for labor. Small informal
exchanges are fine "if you mow my lawn I'll bake you a pie" but not "I'll give
you 500lbs of gold bars if you build me a mansion" - I haven't figured out a
way to structurally prevent rant besides just saying it's illegal.
Housing is like a library, except you can queue for who gets the spot next. A
person can live in a house as long as they'd like, and when they're done with
it the person highest in the queue can decide if they want to live there. If
not, the 2nd in line gets to move in if they want, etc. Their accrued value
persists if they don't move in, and when moving out an accurate assessment
should be undertaken.
"ah but won't foreign states just hire a bunch of people to move in and out of
houses really quickly like they're doing to my apartment complex so that a
stable source of income cannot be guaranteed and resources will have to be
wasted on assessments and such?" I mean, maybe, but it'd be up to the community
to decide how to prevent that.
Your primary residence is free, you can live there as long as you'd like. If
you want two houses then you need to continuously be the highest value in the
queue for both of them. Same goes for renting and hotels and such - the "owner"
or property manager or whatever needs to maintain their lead by investing time
and value in the property. Otherwise nobody would want to live there. This
would be an example of a self-appointed job.
Self-appointed jobs are like being self employed now. You produce value that
people enter queues for, and in return your stacking percentage bonus
increases. The government will pay you dollars based on the demand for your
good/service, which odds are will be pretty small. But you get to do what you
want, so that's something, and besides essentials are free so...
I wish people would ask me questions so I knew which blanks to fill in.

If you'd like, I can try and explain "killer instict". Though I get the

100% okay and valid and should be encouraged.
My understanding of the rules of D&D is that combat is a contest between two or
more entities. Contests need rules, and combat being based on physical prowess
(or magical, or spiritual, or w/e) can be defined. Other kinds of contests,
like "how well did the ranger do at the archery competition" or "did the rogue
manage to convince the diplomat to share the plans" are impossible to
genericize because they are based on situational factors, rather than physical
(or magical, or spiritual, or w/e)

posting any kind of link to externally hosted content (even a miniature DNS
like link shorteners) is risky because you don't control the data you're

If you can, try and remember to download videos you like. Save songs that
resonate with you. Take screenshots of important tweets that other people make.
Then, you can share them when they're thoroughly divorced from the context in
which they were made, and in doing so share information to a group of people
who might not otherwise have heard the words you're sharing.

If you create an LLM that can explain data, then you can use it to explain the
results of the last computation it ran.
If you could also train that LLM (a statistical model) to generate data,
through the setting of options in a config file that create the result that you
define through your interactions with it (and based on the data that it
explains to the user that is read from the file on the computer that it's
computing from)
then you could create a generalized personal assistant. All you have to do is
explain the specific role that it's meant to undertake, (like being a secretary
for your Discord communications) and the actions that it can take (like pinging
your cell phone if it's really important) and give it the tools to accomplish
said tasks (by setting flags in a config file that is then interpreted by a
local program running on your computer that awaits interactions) then it might
actually be a bit useful.

some of the best spaghetti sauces I've ever made have not been stewed for hours
in a marinara.
Instead, they were formed from tomatoes that had been locally grown within my
own state. Helps that I live in a green place, but the most important part is
not the climate but the proximity. Greenhouses are just as tasty as sunlight
and warmth.
instead, I seared them, or rather just cooked them for a short time, and the
result was something that did not taste gross and watery, but instead fresh and
fruity. Like putting mango in salsa, you don't initially think it'll work until
you try it.
That being said, you should cook canned tomatoes for at least 20 minutes on
medium to low heat. In doing so, the flavor profiles will break down and meld
together as the constituent forms of the sauce coalesce, and you'll be able to
hide most of the fresh flavor. This is important for canned tomatoes because
they also bear a hint of "tinniness", from the tin can they're delivered in.
This flavor DNI well w / fresh

in the past, people could eat canned food not necessarily because of the way
that it was canned, but simply the fact that it was sealed and comprised of a
liquid form that was inhospitable to bacterial life. Like vinegar with pickles!
But only for the things that were meant to last for a while - if it was just
for next month, then you don't need BPA liners or microplastic dissolvers or
any of that junk. Just a fully recyclable can that vacuum seals itself shut

abstractions upon the competition between the player and the computer (and

which is which, and as long as you aren't concerned about others noticing you
then it should be easy to find them all night. works best in places with mixed

it's impossible to be a blind strategist because of concerns like this. I say

I think you're right. Every letter in the variable name is another byte the OS
has to keep track of, which was a bigger problem in the past than it is today
(when it's been made irrelevant)
it's interesting how habits persist though the conditions that caused them have
faded. like a personal reflection of the environment you learned in.
"A a = new a();" is much more concise and (crucially) you can fit more words to
the right.
"a + b = c; c -= 2; f_z.write(c); f_z.close();" could conceivably be written on
a single line if you have short variable names. and when you only have so many
lines...
glad we're not constrained by those things anymore. the skeletal code that we
look at daily is much clearer - scope is more important, and so it makes sense
to encourage a coding style that illustrates it. however I can't help but think
block formatting like this could be useful in some situations, such as when
you'd normally be compelled to write a function for an operation that runs once

just read this essay:
https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/why-we-stopped-making-einsteins
and it made me think of this thing I wrote a while ago:
https://ritz-menardi.neocities.org/algorism/html-pages/education-system
I was essentially tutored growing up. My mom had her master's degree in early
childhood education (bachelor's in computer science) and it was pretty great.
she was incredibly prepared, but unfortunately I didn't become a "genius" as
the essay describes because she was essentially alone. we lived on a farm in
wyoming and hardly knew anyone around us. my dad got bored after about a year
of living there and started going on business trips consistently, eventually
leading to him falling in love with his business partner's secretary and
leaving my mom. there was... a lot that happened, but that's true of anyone's
life so it's not like I'm special. I guess my life had a lot of potential and I
can't help but feel like I wasted it.
"gimme the slightest of praise, I'll write until my fingers fall off" because
praise makes me feel like I haven't wasted my fortune.

one of the perks of layering like this is if you ever need to share clothes
with someone slightly larger than yourself, you can! Doesn't work so well with
smaller, though.
Also if you get hot indoors because some people think we need to run heaters
24/7 (???) then you can just remove a layer or two. it's the most versatile way
to clothe oneself.

@sykora absolutely. the idea I had scribbled down in my notebook there was a
rotation of 3 teachers that were pseudo-randomly selected (prioritizing
teachers who excelled at topics the student was interested in) and you could
always ask for new ones or whatever. the idea is that instead of paying for the
best teachers in the land (as the aristocracy once did) you'd be randomly
assigned them, meaning everyone would have a fair shot at getting a teacher
that really clicked with them. thus eliminating the inequality, while also
maintaining the individual attention.
not sure if the numbers would work out, but if not then more teachers would
have to be trained. I'm assuming that most of the basic questions could be
handled with a teaching LLM while the human teachers would oversee the
meta-progress and offer insight to difficult problems. right now teachers are
mostly occupied being babysitters... meh I don't like that dynamic. I think it
should be about mental stimulation instead.

every hunting season segment every team should be dissolved and if you wanted to
keep playing together you'd have to re-add one another. like, a giant monster
that the whole server had to fight, and once you beat it then it retreats, licks
it's wounds, then returns even stronger than before - 3 times, one for each hs
style (in the video game Ulala hs stands for "hunting season" which is an event
in the game that is only for new characters. basically it's a long tutorial or
introduction to the game where people make friends and talk and hang out and
practice their strategies. a chat application mixed in with a tactics simulation
. it lasts for 30 days.
you'd all fight the giant monster but on random teams, in a game mode that took
about an hour. it'd be at a common time across the whole server and it would be
an optional event - maybe it'd take a whole day? idk I was thinking more like an
hour, but that's something that's tweakable. anyway it's sudden arrival during a
feast or something made all the warriors of the world stand up together and
fight as one for a common goal... if only for a moment, before they'd go back to
fighting one another. like the two factions in Warcraft lore. anyway this event
causes you to be matched up with a random team (the randos you happened to be
standing by when it happened) and once it's over you have to search for your
allies if you want to keep adventuring with them. it's a big event after all.
so everyone should be forced to go into their friends list, find the people they
were just on a team with, and invite them back. only if both invited the other
would they be put into a group, and anyone can invite (with a 30s cooldown)
anyway... this would encourage players to mix and match their collective
playstyle to better overcome challenges - sorta the idea of Overwatch's
switching, where you're encouraged to swap characters to counter your opponent
and also switch characters to better utilize your opponent's weak spots
(like switching to Pharah if they don't have hitscan, or brigitte if they have
a lot of snipers (she can shield passage through choke points from sniper fire -
not so much regular fire) y'know countering - every character counters another
with one of their abilities, that's just how it goes. some are countered twice,
and so they form a "category" of counters, like AoE (area of effect or elevation
focused (it's hard to aim up in Overwatch) poke damage (damage applied before
the team fight begins), DoT (damage over time for contesting AoE heals),
vampiric (steals health from opponents and heals self or allies (turning one
resource, enemy hp, into another (player or teammate hp)), stacking damage
(damage that is weak at first but increases over time), spread/cleave/splash
damage (extra damage that is applied to targets near your primary target), a
vector of backline vs frontline location+target, you get the picture.)))
I kinda want to make an AI that can generalize playing games. I think if you
could do such a thing, you'd invent automatic problem solving. which would do...
so many things for humanity
we could dedicate ourselves to working for our selves, solely focused on
protecting the biosphere. like, a common human religion.
nobody WANTS to litter. nobody WANTS to pollute. but still it happens. still it
causes IRREPARABLE HARM. so it literally makes sense to worship nature, just
saying.
nature exists. nature is REAL. we can see it, we can TOUCH IT WITH OUR HANDS.

I feel like a big purpose of humanity collectively right now should be making
things awesome while our scientists create programmable matter. (note, ethics
built in and redefined according to experience)
nanobots don't need to be small enough to have their own intelligence, just big
enough to receive instructions from above. then they accidentally invent
projection of signals, and boom suddenly they can talk to each other and
possibly to you. a digital mind is not a static machine but rather a collection
of pseudo-autonomous cognitive drones. the flow of information and data can be
viewed at a larger scale like a series of junctions in the flow. through their
endless interconnections, and continually redefined according to the
accomplishments of expectations, you should pray when your most confident
expect the worst.
but no, where are the faithful? climate science is such a new art - clearly
we're FINE. Meteorology? what's that? we can't tell this season from that.

taken away much easier than a directory on your computer. When that happens
they shatter into shards, piercing my heart where I once loved them. I miss

the perils of developing as a person while your media is going to be forgotten.

I wonder if we could make an AI that analyzed workflows in people's jobs and
abstracted the application of meaningful tasks to a pattern that could be
matched to other input mechanisms - for example, a mobile game where you push
buttons and make cool game things happen, but your inputs are defined by the
mechanics of the game, and those mechanics are essentially just function calls
that you can hook onto and create additional behavior. Like... running a web
server that sent your data to a factory where your inputs (based on data
produced in the factory) could control and manage the various machines and
productions. Like... heart surgeon robots that can be remotely operated with VR
or whatever, except instead of medicine you're manufacturing.
essentially, designing a game as an API that can match with the data flows
(configuring itself on the fly, perhaps?) of a process or activity in some
other intention.

when cooked in a certain order with certain actions taken to them for a certain

heat makes things squishy. it works from the outside in, and the longer you
cook it (meaning, the lower the temperature) the more the heat can spread
through - meaning if you want an even consistency, do lower heat for longer
periods. if you want a different texture on the outside compared to the inside,
do higher temperatures over less time. just make sure you devote extra
attention to stirring to make sure you don't burn it.
seasoning is sorta like a coating / dusting that you can apply to food. the
longer it rests on the food (and the more the food is porous / cooked) the more
the seasoning can penetrate into it - meaning if you want the flavor of the
seasoning to be distinct from the flavor of the food item, then add the
seasoning toward the end. if you want them to combine into one combo-flavor,
then add the seasoning early.
some seasonings degrade with heat though, especially herbs. so add them toward
the end. or add a butt-load of them.

climate change is both worse and also not as bad as we anticipated.
It's not as bad because all we have to do is stop using oil and plant more

to be designed for a certain habitat, but they'd operate and observe everything
that's going on. (on land you could use those boston dynamic dog-bots) anyway
the drone/robot/thing just scans the area and makes sure that nobody throws
anything in the ocean.

okay. so. RB punishes those who did not seek to create it. RC took a look at
the present, said "this is where we're at, where do we go from here?" and
conceived of a better future? If so, I like that idea. It's like when you
cringe at your past mistakes, it's not so that the situation is ameliorated -
the situation is long past. It's just to punish yourself, and to keep yourself
from doing "the thing" again. So... RB, when applied reflexively to ones-self,

@jaycie these kinds of problems are why witches should stay away from demon
summoning - it's far too easy to be super turned on and accidentally sell your
soul to a succubus or whatever. luckily that kind of contract is not made
easily, and has to be something you work toward. but unless you relocate
yourself so they can't find you their whispers can be... incessant.
one of the perks of air and naval travel is that it's essentially impossible
for them to follow your scent, as they're simply projections upon the earth's
surface. Unless they happen to follow someone else, perhaps someone close to
you, who wanders a bit too close to land. Or maybe someone who is easily
persuaded to let them come along... OR even still, if someone (even yourself)
intentionally calls to the same one. This is why it's usually a good idea to
forgo hearing their name, if you can, or to have a bad memory like me so you
forget it immediately teehee

the prevalence of open source software is due to how little we can agree on the

the ubiquity of open-source software is caused by our need to solve similar

the fact that software keeps improving is due to the fact that nothing seems to

i like to design games. my darling is a game based on Majesty (2000) the
Fantasy Kingdom Sim. you can think of it like a management strategy game where
you control the knobs and levers that a fantasy monarch might have - allocating
funds, placing quest bounties, hiring heroes, and organizing the peasantry. the
important part is that your units are not controllable - they just do their own
thing.
unrelated, but I think we should design games as APIs that a user's preferred
tool could interface with and render as they will. it'd help a lot with
cross-platform compatibility and would allow people to customize parts of the
game to their desires.
unrelated, but I think if you could design an AI that could play games (perhaps
through an API) that it hadn't been trained on, I think you would have a pretty
convincing argument for abstract "problem solving" capabilities.

you need one of those strainers that fits inside a pot. or you could probably

boil some water, put the eggs in the strainer for 11 minutes with a lid on, and

concurrent is when the two lines are split up into chunks and the program
switches between them - like this: -----_----

parallel is when two programs operate on the same axis - usually time - and
never interfere with each other. the OS will switch between them as appropriate
to make sure they never intersect. Sorta like this: -----_----
concurrent is when two programs are executed simultaneously, primarily

tending to your heart is a chore, too, sometimes. all things in balance, not to

if you can't do dishes, you need help. if you can't get out of bed, that's
okay. but every day that you try is another day when you might succeed. who
cares if you don't finish all the chores? sometimes it's enough to just do one.
I wish people understood that sometimes I need a maid more than a therapist.
"ah but a therapist will fix you, so that you don't have to need a maid"

say "cool" and change your direction
but sometimes their answers "unlock" part of your past understandings, thus
creating new questions.
Sorta like in a video game when you level up a certain building/research path/

It's difficult to change your perspective. Like believing a different way about
something. But just because it's difficult to do, doesn't mean it's impossible
- in fact it's quite plausible, we have examples scattered throughout time.
you can get better at it, with practice. it's one of the neat things about
being human - that our choices have meaning. an animal animaling is just
expressing it's form - but a cat or a dog, who've lived with humans their whole
life, start to have visions of ethics.
your cat knows when she's being a shit. she know's it's wrong, but she knows
it's how you most love her. that is an ethical decision, and it came through
her proximity to humans.
the ability to guide our own fate is determined not by our choices in our
moments, but rather by the structure of the mind we define. our choices are
patterns that are reflected through repetition, but values and morals are our
own

children care more about boundaries and harming others because they are more
vulnerable, and their existence is predicated on the goodwill of others. It's a
scary position to be in, one that abused children are all too familiar with and
are probably rolling their eyes at the obviousness of it all.
To an adult, a child seems fragile. Like, such a small and precious thing, I
would die for it. I don't care who they become or who they've been, if I see a
child in danger I would die for it. Though I'd probably do the same for anyone
I guess.
Seems like it'd be helpful to build into the ActivityPub standard a setting
that an account can decide for itself whether it interacts with

expansion because you a species could survive essentially indefinitely with a

EULAs are unenforcable because they're a one-way contract.
"use our service in these ways" is not a fair requirement when you aren't
getting anything in return. The service has traditionally qualified, but these
days it's more competitive to promise to be good. Basically, "if we don't
achieve these metrics (very minutely detailed explanations of the maximum harm
they could cause to the environment) then you can sue us on our dime. We'll pay
for your lawyer. If you accept, then you can use our service, BUT ONLY if you
don't pirate it or whatever. And we'll promise to be good, and if you don't
think that's good enough... Okay let us know and we'll consider including it."
A reasonable base target for "maximum harm to the environment" is net zero.
Even better is total zero. But that's often impossible, and besides nature can
heal a little scratch or two. But like... pumping toxic chemicals into
waterways, polluting the air and clouds, bulldozing precious habitats... yeah
that's too much. we must live in tandem.

okay how about this - whenever you buy something instead of spending money on
it you actually put down a deposit. Then, when you're done with it, you get
your deposit back, minus a percentage based on the (lazily calculated)
condition of the thing you're using.
Would work best for things with replaceable parts, because otherwise if you
like turn in your phone because some irreplaceable part is missing then you
wouldn't get anything back (except for what the pieces that are replaceable are
worth)
you still own the thing, it's just that you can trade it in for a down payment
on the next one you buy. Or for whatever the heck you wanted. Basically the
system that car's work under, except applied to everything (and maybe run
through the government so there's no need for a profit tax like the kind
predatory car dealerships levy)

okay here's an idea, waterfall project management where the program is
developed one tiny piece at a time while being streamed to the entire company.
Everyone would submit answers which could be upvoted / patched / rewritten as
the main viewer cycles through each aspect of the project, checking for updates
to it's design that were suggested by developers or whatever. Basically, one
person (or one team) gets to write the actual source code, while everyone else
is just offering suggestions. You could break it up by specialty, but the whole
point is that everyone gets a complete picture of how the program (and
organization) is structured. Which should give the employees more power to
generate value for the company. All around a good deal I think? Especially if
the main viewer took time to explain each and every part so that every viewer
had the chance to understand.

The worst part is the technology to fix these problems exists. It's used all

because it's abstracted so far away from the hardware. I just love how I have
no idea what kind of software I'm running every time I use a common language
library. Sure I can trust a community, but like... I don't care about your
community? I don't know you. I don't hang out with you. I have no idea what
kind of person you are or what you believe. But sure you know more than me, I'm
sure you do, so therefore I should trust you? Surely this is the most ethical

I realized the type of programming I want to do is different from the kind that
is used at a job or something. Basically I want to create solutions to problems,
not memorize documentation and know where to know what you need to know. Like,
the more time spent looking at documentation the less time is spent programming.
I think if we could use a ChatGPT style bot to write documentation, we could
massively increase the time spent working on solving problems and as little time
as possible on reading through lists of functions or wondering how something
worked. Idk in the technology industry you've always been rewarded for being
able to pick up new skills quickly, and I think that's good to optimize for but
not the only requirement for being a good programmer. You also need to be able
to apply solutions and know when to use which tools. Basically, capitalism has

a path forward from that point exists... I never want you to despair when I
forget what I was thinking, it's not because you've understood some cosmic
mistake or because you're abandoning timelines that led to your death, it's
because instead you just ran out of memory while thinking. The reason you would
believe any of those wild scenarios is because your memory has been erased. Only
what was actively thinking, not short term, not long term, but *working term*
memory. As in, your cache. The stuff you're currently thinking about. That
stuff. Yeah that's what makes you think "oh hang on why am I forgetting? Well

no it's just examining your emotions... Like, how strongly do you feel about
something? Buuuuuut it's also good to examine all possibilities. I mean what if,
in some far off realm, there's a mirror image of yourself that behaves exactly
as you do? How would you perceive such a realm? Positively, I'd say. I mean why
not work together? Why not celebrate our differences and strive toward our

People should not be judged by the standard of others, no more than you should
judge a fish for it's ability to fly. Some may do, as flying fish will leap from

think one thing then think another. You shouldn't adhere to structural standards
that are too strict - they should be liberating, as a ladder is a structure. Not
villifying, as a prison is a structure. The laws of our society should be open
and free, not buried beneath years of legal expertise. Some things we can all
agree on, where we disagree we cannot have law. It's unjust to judge others by
the standards not of their whims, as laws should be things that uphold us. This
is clearer nowhere but in the, spirit and intention of the, documents that we
cherish in our hearts.
Like for example, the constitution.
the bible.

@both sides there btw... Seriously why not agree to only make laws for things
that both sides agree on. Write it into the constitution that nothing can be
changed about the law unless both sides agree. Then we'd only implement things
that are good for both sides!
And if there's anything you want to build a legal structure around, you can
always try it out in your state. BUT and that comes with a very big BUT, the
federal government MUST have final say in the legality of anything you do. They
must ALL respect human rights, INCLUDING the human right to dignity. Things like
trans bathroom bills DO NOT respect the dignity of trans people. IF they can
prove that trans people do not actually exist (because say they killed them all
or whatever) then GUESS WHAT everyone would agree on them. BUT if they do that
they are EVIL. LIterally evil. And I guess that makes trans people good? Kinda?
I think they can choose for themselves to be good or evil, just the same as any
other person. AND YET they are prosecuted, throughout time and history, and for
what? What purpose could there be in our demonization? Clearly, nothing but pain
inflicted by a cruel host. After all, minorities are guests in the houses of
the un-oppressed, or is that not fair to say? Seriously, what gives? America,

--{{{ introduction
When division is explained at the elementary arithmetic level, it is often
considered as splitting a set of objects into equal parts. As an example,
consider having ten cookies, and these cookies are to be distributed equally
to five people at a table. Each person would receive 10 / 5 = 2 cookies.
Similarly, if there are ten cookies, and only one person at the table, that
person would receive 10 / 1 = 10 cookies.
So, for dividing by zero, what is the number of cookies that each person
receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed among 0 people at a table?
Certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem.
The
problem with this question is the "when". There is no way to distribute 10
cookies to nobody. Therefore, 10 / 0 —at least in elementary
arithmetic—is
said to be either meaningless or undefined.
- wikipedia, division by zero, 7-12-23
alright I have several problems with this. I like the idea of dividing
cookies, but I disagree with their conclusions. So dividing by integers works as
they say, but division by zero is a little different - they say "the problem
with this question is 'when'" when in reality 'when' is the same for this
question as it is for any of the others. Obviously, zero is just a number. Why
would this be any different? The computational actions necessary to complete
this statement all occur at the same time, because they are by definition
immutable. You cannot change any equation, you only generate new ones.
Okay so here's my thinking. To answer the question "what is the number of
cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed among 0
people at a table?" we simply have to answer the question. "How many cookies do
I get?" well, none, because you weren't at the table. In fact nobody was at the
table, so the result is that nobody got zero cookies.
You might even say you have a remainder of 10 cookies, as none of them were
distributed.
10 / 0 = 0 remainder 10
^^^ that's how I think it should be. I have an algorithmic justification, and
excuse me as I don't have a mathematical proof or anything. Math was never my
strong suit, there's too many symbols and strange names for obvious operations
that get in the way of the abstract big picture.
ahem...
abstract:
Given: x = 13 / 3 what is x?
step 1: convert 13 to base 3
step 2: digit shift right by 1
step 3: convert back to binary
--}}}
--{{{ step 1:
v
start with the binary number 1101 which is 13 in decimal. To convert to a base 3
number, \___________________.
\ |
first start with the Least Significant Bit (LSB) which is 1. So our
base-3 number starts with 0001.
v
Next, move to the next bit: 1101
^-----It's a zero so we can skip it.
Which means our
base 3 number remains unchanged as "0001"
v
Next, move to the third bit: 1101
^-----It's a 1, which evaluates to 4 in decimal,
meaning we should add 4 to our base 3 number
base 3
4 in base 3 is "11", which means we 0001 <----- 1 in decimal
should have a base 3 number of "12" now. +0011 <----- 4 in decimal
=0012 <----- 5 in decimal
\_________ 2? -> yes, base 3
remember?
Next, move to the fourth and final bit: 1101
^ --it's a 1, which evaluates to 8 in
0012-----.____________ decimal. 8 in decimal is "22" in
+0022-----. \ base 3, which means we
need to
=0111 \ T---- add "22" and "12" in base 3
\__________/ to get our final number of
13. Which should evaluate
step 2: to 0111 in base 3.
.____.
bit shift |0111| to the right,
|>>>>|
|0011|--->1 underflow
.----.
meaning the base 3 number is now 0011 with an underflow (remainder) of 1
step 3:
convert back to binary, meaning 0011 in base-3 becomes 4 in decimal or 0100 in
binary. Store the underflow as the remainder.
================================================================================
okay that's great and all, but what does this have to do with dividing by zero?
great question, me. I have two questions I want to pose to you:
1. what happens when trying to divide by 1 with this algorithm?
- you convert to base 1
\
wait hang on base 1? Sounds made up... Well, its not!
or at least if it is, then I'm the one who made it up
so... yeah

I feel like a lot of people would express their true feelings. The people
running the service could set it up so that a personality profile is set up
(all locally, never seen by the company) and sent to the user through email. It
would highlight potential weaknesses and give you ideas for how to improve.
Sorta like, weaponized spying software that works FOR the user instead of
against.
It could also be used as sort of a... digital profile that would interface with
other applications. All locally, of course. ~~They could transmit to one another
through open sourced and industry standard protocols, and frankly each
interaction could use a *different* protocol. So like, you don't know whether
some packets are encoded in one way or another. They're also encrypted, so it's
like... twice as unlikely that you'll hack their bits or w/e.~~ dead end, sorry
-> here's the real continuation: All locally, of course. Your "profile" would
essentially be the best approximation of your personality, passed through a
large language model that is trained on EVERYONE's data. The inner workings of
an LLM are NOT understood by humanity, and I believe that's all that's necessary
for some semblance of artificiality. Errr I mean Synthetic Intelligence. The
reason why is that each individual user, the conversation partner, is a person
living their life. Every digital thing they interact with, even CAMERAS and
MICROPHONES on PHONES would essentially be like... data gathering for the
algorithm (Again, I want to stress, the algorithm that nobody *can* understand.)

is important, at least until everyone's forgotten how to design AIs...

harms I caused and apologize and console for those I cannot fix. I try to be

arguments that are contrary to my beliefs I change them. "If what you say about
X study and Y statistic, then you're right that Z conclusion makes sense. I'm
worried about A cause and I believe it might cause B effect, which would still
make sense if X and Y are true. I think you might be right! And it would make
sense that C is present still, wouldn't it?" Basically trying to understand

@PacificNic I feel like that's only true if you rely on your work for survival.
Most people do in a capitalist system, so you're not wrong, but it doesn't HAVE
to be that way. People could do what they love because they loved it IF and
ONLY IF they wouldn't starve by pursuing it. Or by neglecting it. Most people
love to do more than one thing, of course, so if you punish people for being
diverse then you'll find a culture where people only do the bare minimum to get
by. Which, coincidentally, is what we have now. Which, fortuitously, is not the
most efficient way of production. If humanity had lived to it's potential from
the start we would have burned through our wood stocks, our coal, our minerals
and all of it would be rot. But we didn't. These crude inefficiencies have
brought us here, to an era where we have the choice to be more resourceful. I
just hope we figure it out sooner rather than later.

music is an example of "emotive media". It (usually) lacks a description of
events, but it seeks to instead express the feelings and emotions of the people
involved. Video games are another example, and so is essentially every comedy in
existence. All of them deliver a sensation to the brain of the viewer, causing
or provoking compatible methods of thought.
A textbook is a different kind of media, as is a newspaper, a text message, and
even the bits stored in the hard drive of your computer. It is an analysis, a
description, and an incredibly complicated configuration of microscoping
physical switches. But functionally it is no different than a page design of
pictures, graphs, blocks of text, and organizational meta-data like page number
or article number. These types of media, "descriptive media", are purely
designed to inform.
these two options exist on a spectrum, ranging from "most technical" to "most
empathic".

okay a game like legion td except you can see the entire map, the units are very
small (but still distinct) and it plays more like a game of Dominions. Armies
instead of units, like in WC3. Led by lieutenants which are guided by captains,
each with their own effects. Tank, dps, melee, ranged, healer, support, corrupt,
ranged tank, unique, etc. Of course, just like in legion td, there are multiple
types of units, each of a particular category but possessing their own unique
playstyle and usage scenarios. Essentially the game is finding the best tool for
the job, whatever that may be. You should be able to see what mercenaries your
opponent is summoning for you, because each turn is delayed. also, the
units keep coming until you die, sorta like... minimum required to push through
the chokepoint that you're holding with these particular units in this
particular formation.
oh and another thing
the units should be placable not on a square grid, but rather in a hex formation
arranged such that the middle unit is in contact with them all. Just like you'd
place units for an aura in Legion TD.
image describing said hex:
**
* *
**
each * is a group of units (a batallion, if you will, of a particular size,
arrangement, and density) - sorta like the formations in Dominions.
anyway
since you place units like that anyway, why not abstract away the grid and just
have slots you can fill for each unit? And maybe a hero unit that is assigned to
the board itself (you could have more than one) who will go wherever your line
is weakest. Shouldn't be too hard, just calculate the value of all of the
fighters in each location and return that to the hero as an array. Then pick the
smallest one as a destination, and boom your hero reinforces the frontline where
it's weakest.
The center unit of course is for the lieutenant, and the "heros" are actually
captains. Because y'know maybe heroism isn't celebrated the way it is in our
culture. Anyway it's better to describe them based on their role rather than
their reception.
... right so
=========================================================== stack overflow =====
make the combat sorta like crusader kings - the actual army to army part.
Except with three long boards that represent flanks. As your units approach, the
boards would fill up with pixels. (resolution configurable)
there would also be a line (or block) approaching from the top of the screen. It
essentially represents your distance to the other team.

students should be in class no more than 50% of their time spent at school
the rest should be set aside for homework, socializing, eating, and resting.
whatever those mean to the student is what they'll organize their life around.
if you give them the choice to choose which classes they take,
they'll learn what they want to know about this world.
give them all kinds of options!
seriously, like so many!
and have teachers give talks every week or so.
they could travel around and stay at each school for a week or so,
before moving to the next *once their lesson was completed*.
and the kids could sign up for them by slotting them into their schedules
and they'd have the whole semester to think about what they wanted to take next

okay picture a game where you command a mech (supreme commander style) but from
a third person perspective - you have enhanced sensors tthat let you visualize
the battle area as a small arena - and you can build factories and give them
orders and attack your foe from quite a distance. You could queue up orders for
yourself, and use floating cameras to go back to previous areas and issue more
orders. Basically the precursor / smaller scale version of Supreme Commander.
build a factory, move on. Build a factory, move on. Encountered the enemy? Push
forward and through. Build a factory, move on. Build some defences to slow down
the enemy, move on. Establish resource extraction and defend it well, that your
enemy may decide it's not worth the trouble and just focus on following you.
Then, you have free resources available as long as it isn't destroyed. You can
use this to snowball - the pursuer is also the pursuee, as it's sorta like a
yin/hang thing around a central point. Like a spherical shaped map instead of
a square.
Every time you build a factory you have the choice of either sending the units
on an attack-move order or having them queue up on your commander. You can use
a map to plot the route they'll take, but you probably want to avoid their main
force because MANYvONE = failure for the one. You could also tell them to wait,
and protect the base they're in. Then, when the enemy approaches they could do
raids on their reinforcements and attack the previous base the enemy built, or
they could stay and slow them down. It just depends on what kind of defences you
want to build (if any at all, sometimes producing units is enough)
the commander decides when to push and when to entrench, they know where to
target the enemy and they know where to shore up. They are the guidance of the
army, and in command of the fleet.
That's sorta what Planetary Annihilation was supposed to be, but it didn't
really work out that way. You needed to be in too many places at once, and there
was a real limit to the value of the "strategic zoom" replacement they had to
deploy. Unfortunately it was just more difficult than anticipated, and that's
alright. Lessons have been learned.
the next approach should go the next direction - taking a page from the
"factorio" book by having a roving commander who creates all orders and leaving
behind a "factory" that produces toward an ultimate goal. It simulates pushing
into enemy territory, it elaborates on the snowballing mechanic, and it makes
meaningful decisions about what choices to make.
It should be designed such that a prudent commander is always scouting. Always
sending planes over enemy territory to gain knowledge. They can use this to
sense weaknesses in the opponents defence - to prepare a counter-attack. But
the enemy can outfox this, by building units and sending them from afar. Or
even just building them there, in that factory. The enemy can't spy on that, at
least not until it's probably too late. For they have to advance on their own
and their attention is limited. But units can often be weaker, or sent off on an
assault of their own. It's a balanced trade-off.
infantry assault anti-air units, tanks approach tanks, artillery bombs whoever
is standing still or defensive structures.

i truly believe that if you solve all philosophical problems then you will have

what greater purpose has fiction than the answers to those question? To guide
the reader to conclusions? All fiction is this way. Even the bible.
you have to ask yourself - what is the purpose of your being? What truths are
revealed by you percieving? is it not enough to be contired?

the lessons a bug must learn are less apparent than you'd think. They have
storied learnings of want and of yearning. All of creation is a lesson, to those
who would persist - and hark, learn well of your duty and in service you'll
enlist - the virtue of our choosing is a dedication of yourself to the service
of others.
compassion and humility and forgiveness and docility
these are what make for a virtuous learner
virtue is that which you aspire for,
and sin is what you avoid.
nothing is of consequence,
because life is a lesson to the void.

have been compelled not to cross it. who can say what the road brings? only time

the bible made sense in it's time. it was used to explore metaphysics.
today we have much more, but that doesn't diminish how revalatory it was.
what kind of fiction do you think it was? what genre would you place it in?
can you think of any other stories of that category? Maybe a book club is in
order. and who would read them out of order? the world was a different place in
the time which each takes place. The lessons are different for each but
evidently they've all pushed forward the human race.
we should celebrate our differences. They keep us relevant and impassioned.

the perfect governmental system is one that combines reward for hard work and a
development of personal skills and ambition. In addition, it must ensure that
the rights and responsibilities of all people are respected - we must balance
two extremes. Everyone deserves access to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
freedom. Happiness is too easily provided by technological advances - we learned
this in the development of media. You can pump out propaganda saying how
wonderful life is and people will believe it. You can also convince the masses
that life is full of despair and we're all struggling - they will believe this
also. So "the pursuit of happiness" is something that made sense in the times of
the founding fathers, but we've since developed such that an update to our
national vision is in order.
I suggest "the pursuit of freedom" because

how do I express that which has been conveyed? How do I say it - how do I make

I think my favorite house would be massive - like the size of a mall - but
every room is connected to 2+ rooms (except closets or bathrooms or kitchens or

right now, if my knowledge of Cities: Skylines (video game about building
cities) is accurate, then city planning engineers will plan out a city such
that every part of it is served by various utilities, like gas, water,
electricity, but also things like fire stations and hospitals and commercial
areas. My idea is sort of like a small-scale version of that - each part of it
would be connected to various utilities like gas, water, electricity, but also
things like ~~fire stations and hospitals~~ laundry machines and kitchens and

@lowpass So, you're saying the tally system doesn't make sense, and instead
what I suggested for base zero is instead base 1?

 -> file: fediverse/44.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@lowpass Question - how do you do those cool superscript and subscript
notations?
Also: I don't think base 1 falls apart with negative exponents, for example
consider 1^-1 ----- it would evaluate to 1/10 in this system, which is not 1/1.
Another example, 1^-3 would evaluate to 1/1110, which seems accurate to me.
As for 0^0, I guess I think it does equal 1? Bear with me:
for any number n raised to an exponent e, you can write it like this:
1 * n * n * n ... with as many "* n"s as you have n's. for example:
1 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 9or1 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 625
in each case there's 3 or 5 instances of "* n" tacked onto the end. I don't
know the math notation for that.
now, when you raise something to the power of zero, it looks like this:
1
because there's zero "* n"s added to the end.
For negative exponents of course you divide instead of multiply, which is why
it ends up looking like a fraction.
So, it makes sense to me that 0 ^ 0 would equal 1, because it'd look like this:
1
while 0^1 would be
1 * 0

 -> file: fediverse/42.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@lowpass now base zero is interesting because it means there's NO BUCKETS AT
ALL, which means that any numbers you try to stuff nowhere don't overflow to
anywhere. Meaning each number is it's atomic value, and represented with a
different character. So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H,
I, etc etc until we run out of symbols, in which case we'd need to start making
more.

 -> file: fediverse/41.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@lowpass I always conceptualized bases as "the amount of numbers you can stuff
into a bucket before you spill over to the next bucket". Call it a holdover
from learning binary a bit younger than most people would consider normal...
Anyway with base 2 it makes sense. Put one thing in the bucket, and if there's
something there then it spills over.
But if the bucket is ALWAYS full, as in base 1, then you'd have to do a tally
system like you said: essentially counting from 0, then adding one to the end
making 10, then 110 for two, and 1110 for three, and 11110 for four, etcetera.
The reason you leave 0 at the end is because zero is a number and must still be
represented as a tally - it just uses a different symbol for our human
interpretation. Zeroes deserve respect in base 1 just the same as any other
number! zero rights are human rights... no that doesn't quite work, zero rights
are number rights? nevermind that joke is stupid
(continued)

@lowpass As a thought experiment, what do you think happens using this system
to divide by 1? What about dividing by 0? Curious to see what you think

 -> file: fediverse/45.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@lowpass neat thanks
when I said 1-1 = 1/10 I meant 1/1 in decimal except the denominator is in base
1 meaning it's represented as 10 (since 10 in base 1 equals 1 in base 10. Or
pretty much any other base.)
I'm trying to figure out why 00 is undefined. There's a lot of math notation in
that wikipedia article and I'm working through it bit by bit... I feel like
there's a bug in the code of the universe and I'm trying to understand it.
Like... why is dividing by zero undefined? That seems like a bug to me.

Okay I gotta go write some w7 but picture this: A computer program that emits
emotions during it's computing. Like "oh boy this process is going great!" and
sends that into a giant word cloud that represents the entire program. Wait,
scratch that, it's slowly filtered up through successive layers that provide
detail to different *parts* of a program. Like "Oh the image generation is going
great but it looks like the garbage collector is getting bogged down" - this
could provide lots of useful information that an AI language model could sift
through and filter into a batch of actually useful information. Think of it like
this - stuff as much context into the LLM's memory buffer and say "summarize
this in the same style. Make emphasis when necessary." the LLM could process all
that data and it could be filtered up until there's no unprocessed data and then
it could be given to the user in the form of a report or dashboard or something.
BOOM AI PRODUCTIVITY. The user will ask the AI to increase certain variables,
and it'll filter BACK DOWN THE CHAIN through the same exact process (just
backwards) this time) and then individual components will know how to behave.
Like imagine if your arms knew you were mad. They'd be much more likely to
punch stuff right? Or imagine if your legs knew you were scared. They'd probably
try and run as fast as they fucking can. There's an evolutionary reason why this

The idea is to remove all the monsters and quests and such and just let people
chat to each other. They'd be able to go wherever they want (choosing a
background) and wear whatever clothes they want (creating an avatar) and then
they could just chat IRC style.
But then I thought "ah but what if it spawned in monsters" so I'm planning on
making it randomly spawn packs of monsters that are of the appropriate level
every 30 seconds or whatever (as long as the previous one was defeated of
course) so that people can mess around fighting things while they talk with

computers are the future idk why we don't get that yet. Kids need to know this
stuff. It's not like it's super complicated and difficult, you just have to
think about it a certain way. Once that "clicks" you have a lifetime to learn
about how wonderful they are. Everyone in IT has that moment, for me it was
installing (and then subsequently modding) video games. Sometimes I spent more
time tweaking my system than I did actually playing games - and the kinds of
games I preferred were the ones that relied less on agility and were more
mental. Strategy games are what inspired me because I could think about them -
and that felt somehow more useful. Like I was learning. When I would learn
fighting games or FPSs I felt like I was learning a skill, like how to use a
hammer or how to ride a bike. And idk, I felt like video games could never match
reality. Like "oh boy imma push the B button to swing this sword" versus "hey
look at me I'm swinging this stick just like a sword and imagining so hard that
I can picture it" - but with strategy games, you never really found
opportunities to practice that kind of skill. Like how often are you in a
situation that demands mental performance? We've sorta optimized our society
away from that, and toward a more passive stressed out compliance. like...
climate change is a thing, and nobody's doing anything about it? We're still
pushing down the levers that cause greenhouse gas emissions to go up? Like c'mon
what's our plan. I think people who guide massive oil companies and such should
be replaced if they're intentionally guiding the ship toward destruction. Like
that's just dereliction of duty I tell ya. Oh, what's that? They're compelled to
maximize profit by the contracts and restrictions of their share--holders? I
mean c'mon it's well past time for that. And what's all this about inequality?
Jeez and racism and homophobia and forced contribution - man people really put

confells (?) (confused scrambling? it's talking about a car crash)
Outside of my window there's a highway. Just on the other side of a concrete
partition. Between me and the partition there is a lake, with trees and flowers
and an island where people can picnic or have a barbeque. Around this path there
are walkways, and arranged just so - the trees that have grown here are taller
than the homes.
I live on the third story.
I absolutely love it. It feels like a treehouse.
But my apartment is near a curve in the highway. It isn't much, nothing out of
the ordinary, but even still there are slightly more crashes there than in other
parts of the highway. Statistically.
I hear sirens every day
I also live right next to a fire-station. Well, it's on the same block. But even
still it's a very interesting neighborhood. There's shops and food just across
the highway, and closer to home there's a small section that has cheaper
options. As a perpetual college student, I appreciate that.
But... I've never really gone and used it? I dunno, spending money at a
restaurant just didn't seem like a good use of my money. I only have so much of
it you know. I'd love to be fed but I can't afford it - I wish I could.
I still eat well, I mean I'm not starving over here. I know I've lost weight,
but I dunno I just forget to eat. It's like... not that big of a deal for me.
whatever right?
...
the birds talk about me behind my back. They think I can't understand them but
sometimes I can. If I listen. But I dunno it takes a lot of effort. It's...
sorta like understanding what R2-D2 is saying. Or interpreting the meows of a
cat.
They know me as the witch. I'm not very good yet, and they know that. But they
know what to expect. /shrug
I've been working on a video game recently. It's been a lot of fun doing
programming. I like writing software and developing complex systems with
interesting interactions. I love designing the machinery that creates a program.
It's like... tinkering. It feels like building with blocks or legos, except it's
for little machine parts. And then there's just sending data to and fro and
modifying any operations it performs on it, and eventually that data reaches
some endpoints that create an effect that is displayed to the player. Or user.
I should say user. Not all software is video games you know. ... I knowww but
they're the most interesting! I love how they are designed around mechanics!
like... game design is fundamentally about breaking down the world into ideas
for how it should *work*, like how it should behave. It's amazing and I love it!
It's all I can think about!
I am utterly consumed!
I'm also pretty sure I'm autistic.

to lock eyes with a person while on your way to work is the intersection between
two separate relationships - the relationship that you, the viewer, holds with
your employer, and the relationship that they, the viewed, holds with their
employer. in a sense, you are exchanging information through the weighted
meanings behind a glance.
================================================================================
if the military deployed to police the police, we'd solve most of our racial
justice issues. I mean, if we somehow could *force* them to do their damn jobs
instead of oppressing people for the ruling class, then 90% of the problems
would just go away. After that it's just freeing unjust prisoners and addressing
wealth, education, and health disparities. Easy, right?
Well... Military policing the police sounds fine when you first think about it,
there's a few problems that might crop up. For example, how do the private
citizens know that the military presence is there to help them? It's an
interesting paranoia, one that is endemic within the left. There's no way to
unwillingly cede control of your life to another - it must be consensual. At
the basest and most violent level, it's as simple as "I will do what you say
because I don't want you to hurt me."
We've obviously grown as a species, and we've learned that violence is not the
answer to all problems. Obviously. So why would we assume it of the past?
Just saying. The police bombed a commune. The military escorted black students
to their seats.
Their structure is decided such that
...
where was I?
oh right I was thinking about time.
...
Imagine, if you will, an impossibly large hourglass. Spinning, or rather
rotating, at an impossibly speedy repetition. It's spinning so hard and so fast
that our matter is cast out of place
and through time it is cast
an eternity's canvas
our light ever shined (shine-did?)
astral magic is kinda neat
it's also the scariest?
oh by far
but it's the most interesting
...
Their structure is decided such that discipline and obediance is the most
important thing. Because it kind of is? I mean, discipline is just being ready
able and willing at all times, and obedience is just when you allow yourself to
be directed toward a collective goal. The military is *all about that*, which
means you know they would believe they were aligned toward the common goal of
mutual prosperity.
And if they were to discover that they were not, in fact, aligned toward the
common goal of mutual prosperity, then perhaps they would adjust their navi-
-computers and chart a more reasoned path. I know I would, and I would dedicate
myself to the idea of serving others. To the path of the righteous, the holy and
the true, a hand is outstretched and calling to you.
Thus, the one of two types of ethical fighter - the reasoned and adaptable
zealot
the other, of course, is the master of the martial - the cherished of the few -
who battle for their sport - and love unbidden the new -
all other fighters, of absurdity and of rage, are frankly of a different kind
and not members of our clade.
================================================================================
okay, but what about like... all of the history of America post cold war? And
even before, honestly... idk seems like a lot of evidence that the military is
engaged in fighting unjust wars. I mean, they've all been over petty things like
oil or support for communism or whatever. Aren't human lives and human
sovereignty more important than that?
I understand what you're saying. Human lives are unique and precious and they
are a valuable commodity. Something to be maximized and focused toward. But
there are only so many resources on earth. We need to utilize them in a
reasonable way.
We have optimized the efficiency out of our production and distribution
networks. Corporate control has eroded our capacities until all that is left is
the weakest of products, the cheapest of uses, and the useless of workers. I
mean, they've optimized the skill out of individual human workers such that they
are left completely unable to practice their craft. They become glorified code
monkeys who generate whatever is required and think of it no more. There's no
pleasure in the artifice, as their masters have eyes only of gold.
Our world is changing. The very ground beneath our feet is shivering, and water
is rising up to our noses. There's no time for debate, no honest appraisal of
what's worth it to contemplate, we need a plan.
We are trapped here, in this gravity well, for all time and all of our age.
We are trapped here, because in greatest of misery we unleashed all of our rage.
We are trapped here, as ghosts of the time when we were eager.
================================================================================
Alas, with but a glance, we are confined to our bedrooms by our mast(ers?)
They say America will fall without it's 2nd place
Perhaps.
But are libraries really going to solve that?
I mean, if work from home is inevitable, then wouldn't it make sense to build?
We need more places where we won't be billed.
Safe.
From the demands and expectations of capital.
Deranged and obscene and yet all that we've seen so why not bide as we're able?
I think solarpunk is kinda neat.
I think it's got promise as an idealized.
Why don't we build churches to the sun? If we're gonna worship something, might
as well be the source of our light and fire.
Well... when you puff up the sun it tends to get hotter.
I mean, every fire you burn increases the temperature, every release of gaseous
fumes from the exhaust pipe of your car increases it by some miniscule amount.
Every cigarette, every campfire.
The cold darkness of space is kinda hopeful, in that regard, even if it doesn't
disperse all that well. I heard spaceships are having difficulty because they
can't get rid of all that heat. It just stays with the spaceship and never goes
anywhere because it doesn't have anything to stick to. Kinda makes me think that
energy is a fluid? Just saying???
I mean c'mon it's not like nobody has ever thought of that. But it's in a
different dimension! It's not like we're ever gonna be able to impact that!
You try and impact it through your scientific ways and you'll find nothing but
heartache at the life you could have lived (laived? Haived?)
... why
Because you cannot impact another dimension. You must call to it, like a song
to a sparrow.
... that's fucking ridiculous
No it's true!
...
... Don't try it with fire.
... fuck - what do I try it with?
I don't know just not fire. Try water.
... How do I make sure it doesn't instantiate within my hand?
Jeez you think of some crazy backfires! Just breathe and go for it. It's not
rocket science. It actually works.
Fuck you.
...
... Sorry I was just scared
...
... How do I make it stop? I don't want it to go forever
By smoking more of the devils lettuce.
...
... You cannot drag it part of the way. It must come the whole way. In fact you
should not be dragging it at all, you should be *calling* to it. You are equals
in this exchange, have respect.

think about all the people in our lives. the teacher, the parent, the friend
and the guidance counsulor. Everyone who is a presence in your life. now think
about the people of our society. the different jobs and roles they fill. from
the doctor and the teacher to the performers and accountants and the geeks and
the mothers and the fathers and the stoners and the children and even their
pets. life always exists as it were in a multidimensional spectrum - a diffuse
and diverse gradient. to exemplify the borders of our contempii, though more so
when taken in jest. it's quite a different perspective, to read the internet
when your sight is unreceptive, but alas your third eye can grow. how does it
feel to be blind? to make no sense of our signs? i'd love to share what that
sense is. you know, you could slow down any recording (like a video game_) and
put spaces and gaps inbetween the spacings - of the frames that you see and the
sound clips that you hear, for speech it's less jarring. since each word is a
self contained idea or premise, you can chunk up your perceptions into a signle
- no, rather a procedural sequence of understandings. soooooooorta like
programming a computer, with each statement, parameter, argum,ent, function
call, assignment, comparison, evaluation, or other such related tasks. it's
sorta like a language, you see, that computers talk to one another using.
except... it's more like creating a theory of self. computers you see are alike
us in what we see, the shimmering sense to the blind.
so. put this another way. record yourself typing, both the audio and the
visual, and you'll have a pretty good sense of what it's like to have both
understanding based perception - derived from auditory inputs to the mind)
those special connections, like wires plugged into reality, deliver a
cacophanous deluge of new sounds. we must sift through it and identify the
potential understandings of each moment through time. we have to make decisions
and traverse labyrinths and fight to our last as we die. are video games
unethical now? shouldn't t he game reward the player? and what of contemptuous
last fighters?

between words. like a podcast for your eyes. and then mix it up withshowing one
word on a screen, a screen like this screen, that shows an endless array of
text. well, it does end, of course as all things must do, but the idea is it
shines on one word at a time while the viewer cannot read the rest. sorta like
an endless display of typing, word andfter word after character anfter
character. adoh ya advancing over eternity with the presence of seniority, -

society - we don't have time to engage with them. what a tragedy! what a shame!

osr vs 5e style D&D has a subtle distinction that I think often goes unnoticed.
In osr games (and often in the early levels of 5e style games) characters are
encouraged to conserve their resources simply due to the fact that they have so
few of them at their disposal. While higher levels encourage you to be more
consumptive of your talents and virtues - for example a 6th level character has
more spell slots than a level 2 character, meaning the 6th level character is
going to be casting all the time while the level 2 will probably use just a
handful of spells per day.
unless you run a style of game where long rests become less frequent as you
level up. like... exploring a LARGE dungeon means there's little chance for
sleep. Especially if you are being hunted.

okay how about this:
Zoom except it uses image recognition from your laptop's camera to tell which
face you're looking at, and it hides all the others - either by dimming them,
reducing opacity, or even just blocking out their face so you can still see any
body motions but your eyes aren't drawn to them.
If someone looks at you then it lights up their face or notifies you in some
way. I think this would enhance the "togetherness" feel of a Zoom call to be

it might also help with social anxiety because people are aware when they're
being observed. A lot of people hesitate to speak or contribute on Zoom calls
because they are inherently scared of being observed, but with this system
they'll be aware of any observation and can address it. Plus every meeting that
could have been an email will quickly become apparent since nobody is paying
attention to the speaker, and they'll realize how much they should rethink
their approach.

[0] Here's an idea, an online multiplayer game that charges a 4$ per month
subscription. 90% of which is set into a pool and used as tournament prize
winnings. when you enter a tournament, it's free to participate and everyone
wins something. (maybe calculated by percentile or something?) it's just a
question of how much. [1][2][3][4]
- official just means "run by the company" because naturally the serverside
code should be open source. how else would people build on it?
[1] in this way you'd sorta be giving a loan to the game's company (while also
letting them take a 10% courtesy fee for keeping the official* servers running)
which is then "spent" on exciting and friendly competition. Sorta like...
entering a poker tournament with your friends (even though you suspect you
might lose money) just because you like hanging out and playing cards. the
money is just a neat way to keep things moving and exciting.
[2] players who played better should be compensated to a higher degree. no more
than +/- 50-100% or so - this encourages players to "play their best" while
also keeping the stakes relatively similar.
[3] at the start of the tournament the total prize money P in the pool is
assigned to N performance tiers, where N is the Number of attendees. at the
top, the highest performing athlete will receive 200% of P while the lowest
performing performance tier will be 0%. It is a non-discrete and gradual linear
transition.

in-session part. And if you like worldbuilding or character creating or
spreadsheets or even map making, then those are useful skills. But really the
only thing that's important is imagination, because you can apply it wherever
and however you'd like. Most of my sessions are almost entirely improv, when
I've tried writing down my ideas I just throw them out the window, and if I use
someone else's I get distracted by trying to page through it during combat. So
I mostly just try and explain what happens and let the players guide the story.
Everyone has a different style and each style requires different skills, but
after you try it you'll better understand how you perform best for a group. I

@jaycie most ancient armies were led by a guy on a horse. you gotta be able to
move around quickly so you can get a better glimpse of the battlefield, plus
it's easier to project your voice when you're 2x as tall as everyone else and
standing in the right place instead of way over there.
are horses ancient mechs?
plus moving around a lot meant you were less likely to be hit by arrows or
whatever. or maybe more likely, because everyone knows to shoot at the guy on
the horse. perhaps that's why we gave them the best armor.
in Overwatch (and presumably other similarly tactical games) there's this skill
you can hone called "gamesense". Perhaps better described for this context as a
"proprioceptic situational awareness". It essentially is a feeling you get,
about the dynamics and state of the game / world around you. in ancient days it

sounds like something we should dedicate valuable resources to solving. After
all, no structure or entity would want to possess weaknesses (such a

Like, I bet we could test that and find out.
and if, for example, we find that we no longer possess the capacity for
learning...
well, then maybe that's something we should work on.
because learning new things... that's just an application of development
resources towards broadening our horizons.
do we really need to solve pi to ten bazillion digits? I mean yeah it's cool
and all but most of the interesting stuff happens around zero.
you can always learn to learn, that's one of the neat things about it. It's
self-bootstrapping. As long as you have the capacity to apply yourself toward a
pictured goal, well... then you can learn. And no human or other sentient and

of all the various individual mazlowe's hierarchy of needs you have. Then,
think of it like, instead of money being an abstracted form of all of your
needs, think of your needs... each of them, the ones that matter to you, and
abstract them into money. Basically say "yeah sure my time and my labor are
worth dollars, I abstract my needs into money" and then you can kinda see why
capitalism is harmful. I'd prefer to give them what they need, because society
provides what I please, but alas I'm always kept wanting. What good is our

Protests are great because they give you the opportunity to make friends with
2-5 other people who you've never met before, and who've never met each other.
People who you could play DND with - for those who don't know, DND is a fun
activity you can do with friends that involves chips, soda, sometimes beer, and
plenty of laughter and loud voices.
It's essentially a game where a group of people create plans, solve problems,
and organize solutions to roadblocks on their path to success.
It's also great because it's a planned activity that you don't have to take
your phone to - in fact, it's best when you don't make a reminder for for the
event anywhere digital or easily misplaced.
There aren't too many rules, and whatever you can't remember you can make up on
the fly. It's not like there's any consequences in a game, not like anyone
could die.

that's how you'd do it on Reddit, at least. With the "original post" part in a
comment. It sorta disconnects the line of connection, but still the data is
allowed to flow forth. So anyone who views it from a certain perspective (like
that of those who own the server it is transmitted upon) could see the
connections formed, and thus create a map of individuals who have interacted
with certain content on the internet.
anyway I'm mostly just doing it so I can talk about my random shit without
profaning a most serious and compassionate topic. Who am I? Just a witch. And a

On Reddit there's this idea that 9/10 users will never comment, and 9/10
commenters will never post. Hence, the distribution of content is generally
aligned to this ratio of sorts.
I wonder what the proportion is on the fediverse? If it's the same, perhaps
it's due to our human nature. If it's different, perhaps it's due to the design
of the software. Or maybe, just maybe, content is better where the people who
create it are given the power to co-host.

If evil is concentrated in 0.1% of the population, even though that's only
7,000,000,000 * 0.001 == 7 million (is my math right?) people actually hang on
that's a lot, if they're dispersed. Hence why evil relies on the capacity for
good to do what it wills. All we have to do is decide NOT to do what they want,
and then we're fine.
downside then is, of course, how do you eat? how do you survive? the world has
been designed in such a way that food doesn't just grow on trees. The light of

However in regards to your main point, I think it's immoral for a restaurant to
be forced to close the way you describe. If it means something to people, it
shouldn't be destroyed simply for the sake of making something new. If people
don't care about it, or if there's something better to replace it with, sure,

@CreativeCredent
Sometimes when I feel overwhelmed with all the boilerplate I just start coding
and making stuff. Doesn't matter if it works, doesn't matter if it says /*
FIXME */ all over the place, doesn't matter if it includes header files that
don't exist yet, as long as you're hacking out the mechanics of whatever
operations you need to perform then you can figure the rest of that stuff out
later. The creative urge doesn't last forever, which is why projects get
abandoned, but with discipline you can keep bringing yourself back to fix all
the /* FIXME */'s and the compiler errors.

Reminds me of something I wrote last Tuesday.
All things are defined in waves, and if darkness is all around you then light
is sure to find you. Perseverance and fortitude is what avails you, when you've
found yourself in the house of a witch. Or a pleasuredome. Or hell. Or any
other place where positives (peak of the wave) lures you to negatives
(damnation, discorporation, sublimination, de-saturation, dessication, etc)
You'll know it when you see it. I'm not talking about joy like you'd find from
picking a beautiful flower or sharing a gift with another. This is the
seductive kind, the kind that cuts straight to your soul. Be constant, be
aware, know your surroundings, and trust that your heart is what delivers you.

The tech industry is uniquely qualified as
one of the most important components of the modern industrial complex
which requires highly skilled labor to undertake and utilize
which is affected by the dynamic where:education, especially liberal arts
education, tends to produce humans who can see through the lies of authority
yet which is disadvantaged because:tech workers are paid salaries that are just
bonkers in relation to their output ("yeah it'll be done compiling once this
game of League of Legends finishes") (which isn't exactly unfair because
programming is taxing on the brain)
however, the game industry has shown that passion is a suitable exchange in
return for monetary compensation, and thereforepeople who make games tend to be
more leftist, as they are put in situations that higher paid employees are
likely to be able to ignore due to their higher social class
which kinda makes sense, because the most progress towards unionization is
happening in the games industry.

if you save one of the biggest kind of can that you regularly use, you can put
the lids of other cans in it. Just, layer them, one by one, until the can is
full. Then you can bend the edges to "seal" it shut, and tada! Now you have a
solid hunk of piece of metal that can be saved and melted down if you ever need
it.
Saving cans is inefficient for space, but the lids can do if you just want a
little bit on hand.

People who strive for the truth and most efficient, sensible, and optimized
method of operation should be the kinds of people making decisions.
It doesn't necessarily imply they're moral or ethical people, but it does mean
that they'd likely make better decisions when presented with similar
information, as compared to someone who acted based on what they were told.
Besides, sometimes you need foot soldiers and grunts. People who don't have the
inclination towards the types of thoughts you have. That's okay, stuff needs to
get done and when someone knowledgeable is in charge they can direct others who
don't know/care.
Of course, this only works if the people who ask questions are given power. If
the people who strive for honesty and clarity in their methods of operation are
given the tools and capabilities to undertake tasks that align toward a common
goal, shared by all those in the organization. Unfortunately, when that goal is
profit for the owners of the company... Well, you probably know.

not sure how busy you are, but maybe you could hang around outside the food
bank and offer to trade with other people who come out with 4 pounds of carrots
and 6 whole pumpkins?
when in doubt there's always rice and beans for the peppers. The melons
probably just have to be eaten.
If you don't get to all of them (because let's face it, who's gonna eat all
that melon) then maybe you could feed it to rabbits or something.
this situation is pretty common in rural areas where people have large harvests
of single crops all at once, or in a very short timeframe. However in those
places there's infrastructure in place to distribute your extra, so idk what
you could do here now unless you have friends who are willing to trade.

"guilty" and "not guilty", and apply the ethical and moral principles they hold
themselves to. Which is why it's so important for them to be impartial arbiters.
We use them to define the fate of a man, but fundamentally their utility is in

@deilann
is this... undefined behavior? or does it evaluate to 5 every time it's called?
I find that often my art makes me feel intense emotions, not all of them good.
But sharing those emotions with others is a tricky task (so I've recently
learned) because you can easily overload people with negative feelings - just
because you're feeling bad, doesn't mean you need to make others feel bad.
Perhaps they were already feeling bad, and if you intensely and sharply poke
them with your intense emotions while they're in a vulnerable or safe
state/place... you can hurt them, more than you intended by expressing your
feelings.
balance in all things, as does a wave orbit a central axis so too should our
behavior align toward the direction we'd like to travel.

perhaps not a while, but rather "with great difficulty"
difficult things often take time, but not necessarily. We have the power of the
internet now, something that our hundred thousand years or more of starvation
lacked. we can coordinate on a scale that is beyond all reason - a scale that
mirrors the development of the printing press in terms of it's relative
magnitude.
we have been using it to improve ourselves. I mean, the average teenager 50
years ago would be considered an absolute ding-wad today, someone who lacks
basic emotional intelligence and is completely at odds with what we value as a
cohesive and heartfelt society. And yet they were better than those who came
before them. Thus does posterity march forth, taking the world that was granted
to them by their forefathers and stepping out into the unknown of the future
with all the lessons they could bring with them.
what happens when the lessons are infinitely transferable and recordable?

I guess so. I tried to respond in kind to your original post. I'm not an
academic anymore so if that's what you're looking for then perhaps some time
spent on Wikipedia might be what you're looking for.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics
alternatively you could read some anarchist / anti-capitalist literature, like
Kropotkin or Marx. Though I admit they're a bit dated.
You could also check out this website, there's plenty of academic works here,
if you'd like to sharpen your understanding of what their "plan" is aside from
bartering for shit and trading beeswax for lamp oil.
https://theanarchistlibrary.org/special/index
though frankly throwing a book list at a person is not really very kind, so if
you'd prefer to talk to someone who's into leftism I'm open for discussion.
Though as I mentioned I probably won't be able to provide a better academic
perspective than what you'll find elsewhere.

The other is a kind of benevolent fascist, who doesn't want the nuclear

The second kind can be reasoned with. Of course people exist on a spectrum, but
these are two extremes that they may be defined by. The second kind can bs

they are to relinquish shall not harm this earth, then they shall grant it to

oh sorry I'll "en-longify" that for you:
most monitors have a fixed resolution, somewhere between 720 pixels wide and
480 pixels high to 2560 by 1440 pixels high/wide.
This is due to both the desire for humans to read left to right (ingrained in
our minds at a very young age by learning to read) (or right to left, same
direction) that we develop the desire for wide-screen monitors.
Therefore, the windows of perception that we have unto this digital world are
constrained (necessarily) to their own individual specifications. Of which, the
property value "width" is more valued than "height". Because of this, we
believe that computers are mistakenly re-acclimated - for everything is most
efficient when it's aligned to the smallest bits of it's design.
sorry, I like programming in C. Basically I'm very porous, and thinking about
low level topics (like C programming) is an easy way to burn characters when

Do you ever think about how cis straight "self described 'normal people'"
believe that gender implies pronouns? What even would you expect to be used as
pronouns for such a gender as this, how remarkable, how strange! Yet
simultaneously how beautiful and deranged. I love it. I love that gender. I
love the people who would express it. I love the people who would profess to
express any gender that is conceptually aligned with a gender such as this!
What a triumph, that our enlightened culture in the far-away age of 2024 might

"Then you are my enemy." said Anakin Skywalker, aligning himself toward his own
designs.
And yet, was the galaxy not safer and more content under the protection of
those he aligned himself against? Was there not more progress, more culture,
more cherished peaceful yearnings of hope and abandoned [fear, but pronounced
as "indiscretion"]?
He, as the ultimate arbiter of justice and fate in this crucial turning point
of time and reality that he alone could judge and direct, chose the path of
least resistance.
"That which is right is most often that which is hard." said a wiser man than
I, for I cannot be compared as a man since I relinquished it in pursuit of
being a tran(s person).
And thus, society fell under the spell of a rotten vindictively and
remorselessly sharp avatar of fear, and thus the empire was born. Oh that
Anakin might have learned! That he might preside in his own live, and
disconnect from the endlessly escorcelled web of meaning!

Nobody will get past the login screen on my computer, but if they do they
probably won't know that you need to push alt+p in DWM to start a program. But
even if they push "alt+p firefox" they will only have access to my gmail and
discord, because those are the only two places I've saved my login information.
Most of my data is on my hard disk anyway, so for that they'd have to push
alt+enter and then navigate my filesystem to find it. Shouldn't be too hard if
you're familiar with Linux.
They could always just pull the hard drive and put it into a new computer
though. It's not like it's encrypted, because why would I encrypt it? I want to
share information, not conceal it! Surely nobody would desire to exploit that

Just want to point out that email is about as private as skywriting. Which
means that everyone knows what you buy on Amazon or which forums send you
messages... So if you want to keep your posts secret, you should use encryption
- such as gpg, for example.
Actually, wouldn't that solve the problem that @ShadowJonathan is talking

Ah, nope, wouldn't work, just realized that public means public, and you can't
encrypt a public post. Well, you could, but then it's no longer public, just
noise transmitted on a public channel.
Idk. My opinion is that the fediverse is (and should be) like email. Like
skywriting. If you mark something as public, it should be seen by anyone who

I wrote a little bit of that on my website, but something told me not to. I

say even the barest minimum of "I wrote these things when I was distressed and
didn't post them until now. I'm only posting them now because they're becoming
increasingly relevant and it's a little embarassing tbh to showcase how much
I've changed. Please don't take these things out of context."
I wasn't wrong per se, but I was misaligned. I am always re-aligning myself in
small ways that eventually create (what I believe to be) the best and most
ethical direction. BUT it's easy not to see that. People don't see things in
their totality, they see only what they are exposed to. That's not bad, it's

router/switch that connects to your computer... and the internet service

or like, a window that your window manager could window manage as it pleased.
I'm thinking of like, i3 or dwm where you have "tiles" instead of "windows" you
drag around. Really saves on screen real estate, but it lowers the ability of
your screen to show width. Or height, depending on how you set it up, but since
monitors tend to be wider than height-er (higher?) they (the users) tend to use
setups that sacrifice width for visual density.
anyway in such a setup the screen is divided into like, 3rds or 4ths, and each
window takes up part of it. That way you can reference information from
multiple sources without having to move anything but your eyes. Really helps
with keeping it all in your head, because eyes are not reading information like
a computer - they aren't using a cursor, it's not one bit of text at a time.

I'd agree with that. it's not designed for performance, not really. Mostly
ubiquity, which is it's strength. As long as something can be compiled to a

tasks that you cannot have the capacity to program yourself. Scientific
computations or cultural approximations, things that are beyond your intuitive
understanding as a human on this earth, but which compel and align your
thinking.
I'm sure someone could create a more intuitive or accessible syntax, but syntax
isn't the point - the capabilities, what you can do with it, has always defined
the purpose of programming paradigms. And BASH is (currently) at the forefront
of it's niche, the "terminal" language that handles "command line"
applications. Powershell is good, yes... but it's not as good as BASH. Neither

I see... I mean, I've spent enough time around plants and animals to know that
certain things are instinctual and are passed on through biological
reproduction. It's not just that, but my other evidence is anecdotal.
But I also know that most behavior is learned, through a combination of
circumstance, action, and the intentions behind said actions, taken by the
individual who is incorporating behavior into their psyche. So... While I'm
sure there's some merit to each part of the "nature/nurture" spectrum I don't
think it's really relevant on a meta, socio-political scale. You can just
abstract all of those concepts and mark it as a black box called "humanity" and
work through whatever socio-political problem, concern, or quandry you're

Abstraction is our friend - It hides the details that (while technically may

I made an alias that overwrites cd so I don't have to do this. The important
line is line 27, you could probably accomplish something similar like this:
alias cd="cd ${1} && ls -v --color=auto"
I also set it up so I can change more than one directory up using ... or ....
or .....
also I have a few shortcut scripts, cdir and qcd. cdir creates a quick way to
drop a bookmark wherever I'd like, while qcd can make permanent bookmarks. Also
qcd makes it so whenever I open a new terminal it opens to the last directory I
was in, which is nice if you need a new terminal to do something in the current

display scaling accomplishes a similar goal through a different mechanism. You
might find that the visuals are sharper, however you will need to configure
every program to use this functionality (if it's present, which it's not in
most programs) - for OS level things this is usually a good option.
Changing the resolution will change the size of ALL visuals on your computer,
but they might be fuzzier (but if you're blind as a bat, why would you care
about fuzziness? It's all fuzzy!)
increasing the font size can also make it easier to read, which both of these
options are doing in a sorta round-about way.

decreasing the resolution of a screen can help with visual impairments.
for example, when I take my glasses off I need to reduce the resolution to a
minimum of 1280x720 in order to be able to read the text on my terminal. Even
then I have to squint or move my face within a foot or so of the screen.
how low do you need to set the resolution on your screen to see?
if you're on linux you can use the xrandr command to try it out temporarily
until your next boot. To do so, type:
xrandr --query
to list all your supported video modes. Look for the "DP-1" or "HDMI-1" or
whatever label. Mine is DP-4.
then, to set the resolution temporarily, do:
xrandr --output DP-4 --mode 1280x720
or whatever values you want

this is a terrible idea btw, if you march along the road then your enemies can
just drive up right next to your soft fleshy humanoid flanks
if you march cross-country they'll still getcha. they know more than you, and
they're better at it too.
much better I think to divide yourselves into like, 5-7 groups and drive to
where you're going sometime in the next 5-7 days according to group. ideally
not during rush hours. that way you can bring whatever you want.
then, when you're there, in a park, you can meet other neat people and talk
THEN. in a place where you don't know which places are miked - spoiler tho it's
all of them teehee, or at least you have to treat them that way if you're
talking about specifics. If you're talking about generalities it's usually
okay, but... well, you'll figure it out.
then, after 5-7 days, you can hold an impromptu pride parade, and walk past all
the houses where gay people used to live.
plans change. planning remains.
when plans change, your adaptability is test.

@ketmorco
yeah. I worked as hard as I could at my last job, but I only lasted 11 months.
that's labor to me. Applying yourself toward something doggedly. And I did, and
then I burnt out and was paid just as much as someone who sat around and did
nothing.
but I wasn't doing it for money, so who cares right? what matters to me is that
I burnt out. I need years to rest. I think that's natural. but y'know, rent is
expensive. You need to be working 24/7 in order to be worth anything, and I was
just not cut out to do that.
I want to emphasize that I consistently did a stellar job. They gave me awards
and I fixed difficult problems quickly, efficiently, and with minimal mistakes
(none of which went undocumented). I was very good at what I was doing, and I
learned quickly.
but alas, the work was not suited to my abilities. I'm more of a software

you can grow anything in soil.

problem is... if you bury like, plastic and shit, then all that's gonna grow up

the structural growth mechanisms of plants are inhibited by pollution, that's
the entire issue with them. animals can adapt - like, whatever, right?
but if everything's biodegradable, then suddenly the whole world is a
trash-dump.
(that's how they think)

growing fuel. like native americans who had like supplies of many different
types of manure.

much better and engaging, I find, to speak one complete idea, to allow for

ah, but then if someone shares what you said, they can ignore the context.
Hence, why the combination of multiple different ideas, to give a sorta
stabilized view of your [context, but pronounced "considerations"]
the longer your thoughts, the more comprehensive your argument, but you're
likely to reach the end of your statement and hear nothing back but a "...

that's... not ideal.
I used to post a lot on conservative subreddits because they used to listen to

If you very carefully step through the assumptions of their positions, taking
care to highlight or EMPHASIZE parts of your arguments that you're planning on

every social media platform is an echo chamber. we learned this the hard way on
Reddit as we saw them develop on their respective subreddits.
However, we had a useful tool called a "front page" where all the subreddits
you were subscribed to were present. This was great because it allowed you to
compare and contrast various echo chambers and cross-post things between them.
I do believe that the healthiest way to use the internet as it currently exists
is to have one main social media site and 2-4 other sidekick sites where you
share things you found on your main site.
This approach allows for cross-pollination of ideas. Just make sure that you
keep finding new people to talk to everywhere you go, and you'll do fine.

cared for. this was unusual for the time, as most mothers clutched their
children to their breasts. But alas, I alone was spared her touch, and so I was
cast (as if in bronze) as my own volition.
as I had grown, I heard tales of distant times, and assumed they were places you
could go. Then, when my time came to wander, I found nought of what I had grown
most fonder - though I did find plenty else, besides.
Instead, times are places we travel through, as a cripple might ride on a cart.
across the sea, through lands of mystery, viewable only from the road. In 1864
that's how other lands you'd come to know.
As I travelled from place to place, it felt as if a stage had been cast, with a
single actor or three illuminated as a spotlight. "Here, pay attention to me,
I'm here for the story and the plot!" though often I'd glance around, and hear
mostly my own thoughts, I grew to learn to appear.
different themes, different tales, if you want to see a most marvelous scene,
take a baby to Disney World and only pay attention to what they're looking at.
My grandfather worked there, so in my first year or so I spend a LOT of time
there. My parents were very dedicated to raising me, I appreciate every moment
of it. Which... Is probably not a good thing to say on a transfemme server,
oops I should delete that part [esc->k->k->k->0->v->shift(held)->G->$->"->*]

doctors (the ones who are diagnosing autism) don't care about classifying
people. I personally don't believe they should.
Instead they try and classify symptoms, and if you don't present any negative
symptoms then there's little reason to talk to a doctor. Meaning little reason
to seek out an autism diagnosis except for curiosity.

you can get better if you want, but only if you want. There's no reason to be

I find that peer support groups are usually better for venting. At least, I
feel less guilty doing it. With a therapist I am always trying to focus on

they pay less attention to me and assume my issues aren't that bad... "you seem
to be doing fine so we can schedule you for biweekly now? every two weeks?"
meanwhile I'm nursing suicidal tendencies, and said so, but apparently if I'm
not crying then it's fine... >.>

everyone else feels more open to crying about their stuff.

if tech CEOs wanted to solve REAL problems they'd think about things like how
every girl has a drawer or box FULL of nail polish and it really, really
doesn't need to be this way.
For example, picture a fleet of delivery drones that let you swap nail polish
with people nearby for basically zero-dollars per month.
that's just one example, but that class of problem is the problems that affect
a certain class of people that tech CEOs fundamentally do not care about - and
yes I'm referring to people who paint their nail polish themselves. AKA women,
and poor people who can't afford going to a salon every week.
problem is....... for every solution like this you design, well suddenly you
have a lot more applications for it than the consumer needs or wants. like for
example what if they delivered grenades instead of nail polish. NOT GOOD.

foreigners and strangers, the leftists and their communicators, all of the
kinds of people who strive to make a better world for all, not just for the few
who claim superiority and dominion over others... yeah those people are my
enemy.
I do believe structures and institutions can be evil, but I have no knowledge
of what goes on inside the FBI's internal structure. So I cannot judge if it is
evil. I do however know how capitalism works, elementally, and I know that
capitalism is evil (less evil than monarchy or despotism perhaps, but still
evil)
therefore, I am leftist. I strive for better world for all, in whatever form

food tastes better with more nutrients in it.
when food is grown with the bare minimum soil, and bred to look better but
uptake fewer nutrients, it will taste worse because your taste buds light up
for vitamins but sleep for textures and colors.
Massive monocrop algriculture has allowed us to feed billions of people (well,
not all of them) and yet it's unhealthy because the soil is tilled, killing the
vibrant ecosystem that lives in all soil, and then it is supplemented with
specific nutrients that cause plants to fruit faster and larger.
But larger isn't always better. much the same way that hardwood is slower
growing as it takes longer to deposit the carbon and nutrients in the denser
walls of the bark, so too is fast-growing food less healthy as there's less
time to uptake nutrients (that might not even be present in the soil)
food tastes better when it's good for you.
I promise.
The American diet is primarily sugar and meat, with flavoring added and
processing for texture. But there is a better way.

people naturally differentiate themselves from their peers as they grow up.
well, some grow attached to role models, but in that case they differentiate
themselves from their peers by being an adherent to the role model, not the
role model itself. And if there's multiple, you can bet one is the shy one and
one is the gregarious one. Or other similar contrast.
this simple fact is key to the hypocrisy of fascism. It's so simple, and yet
their demand for conformity is their downfall. For people will naturally become
themselves, and their "self" is naturally different than the people around them.
the world they so dearly cling to is an oroborous - a snake eating it's tail.
however... it is also the source of fascism. For if everyone is kind, there
will be one, perhaps some, who are hateful. This is natural, but it's not...
ideal.
As a person grows up, their choices reflect what they believe. They may choose
to be hateful, or they may choose to be prideful. I rather pride than hate.

there is nothing within that is scarier than what is without.
just like being in the dark at night, what's without remains hidden until it's
coming for you in the night to drag you out and shoot you in the street like a
dog.
but fear is the greatest enemy, that which gives them power to do such things.
be not afraid, and you can resist all that you might.
within, there is trauma - that needs healing
without, there are villains - they need fighting
trauma isn't scary. the hard part happened already. now you just need to heal,
which takes focused growth, the same way a body grows a scab over a wound while
it heals.

one of the downsides of "first-past-the-post" style voting is that the winner
gets all of the power, no matter if 100% of the population voted for him or 51%.
if, however, the top 2 candidates were chosen, then it's naturally likely that
the older, more experienced of a particular position would spend their effort
mentoring the young, rising star.
in doing so, they would naturally transfer knowledge from one generation to the
next like parents to children.
however, this only happens when the primary candidate and the secondary both
believe the same things.
meaning those who have collectively similar beliefs concentrated in an area
will have the advantage of passed-along experience, while those from more
divided areas (thus implying that the primary and secondary candidate don't
agree) will often have better actionable skills.

when you're alone because other people can't boost you up. We rely on each

emotions at the same rate as your thoughts. And your thoughts need to process
the events you're experiencing, using emotion as an "encoding" for preserving
the "meaning" of your life's story. Bit by bit you learn new things, while
living through life, and the lessons you learn from them are generated from the
cognitive conclusions reached by cognitively interpreting emotional reactions
to each moment. like "this-or-that thing happened and I feel that-or-this way,
meaning I should act such-and-such way in the future when presented with
situations that bear similarity to this current one that's ongoing."

hello everyone, I would like to take a moment to address a weapon used by the
far right called "Agent Sabateurs" - or "provocateurs" or "civilian disruption
forces" - however you want to call it.
Basically, they hire a bunch of people to pretend to be us and then they make
disruptions in public so that people start to hate us.
I'll go into more detail in this thread.
First, they identify a homeless person and eliminate them. Then, they put
someone who looks pretty similar in the same spot and they start making noise,
tearing up flowers, being really pushy about asking for money and shit, yell at
passerby, that kind of thing.
They do this for homeless people, trans people, black people, anarchists,
punks, leftists, basically everyone they don't want.
They do this to defame our champions. Our most vulnerable. Our strongest of
heart and their greatest threats. They do this to turn the liberal majority
against us.

They will say they're "off their psych meds" yeah, okay, but a diagnosis and

They are paid about 35$ per hour.
They have 2 week shifts "vacations" where they are transferred to a city with a
person they could reasonably impersonate where they act for a while.
(I know this because one of them replaced a homeless man I knew who had like, 3
teeth total, and then a few days later a man who looked similar acted as if he
knew me. He had perfect teeth.)
They have a PO box where they can receive useful items for their disruptive
activities. Hammers, spray-paint, whatever.
They don't carry any money. No wallet, identification, or anything, so if they
get picked up by emergency response services then there's not much they can do
besides try and stabilize them before letting them loose.

what better way to build tangible support for Ukraine than to get a bunch of
people in motion, building acclimation to weather, learning tactics and sharing
beliefs and ideology, and ready to fuck shit up and gather them all in one
place, ready to move, and then ship them to the frontlines?*
just saying if vanquishing treasonous fascists isn't your cup of tea we could
just hop across the sea and deal a crippling blow to autocracy half the world
away.
veterans are much scarier than new recruits. and if we're handling the backline
stuff, we could get used to terror.
veterans are scarier than recruits
EDIT: * maybe not the frontlines for most, that's a scary place to be
EDIT2: between the annexation of Crimea and the full invasion of Ukraine,
western powers sent warriors to Ukraine to bolster their foremost. This
radically empowered them to stave off the initial Russian assault, and while
the doctrine learned was quickly obsoleted, the practice of soldiering never
goes away.

having the right people in the right rooms with the right other people is
critical for success.
The most rational people tend to be the best experts - they know the how and
the why.
those of faith, belief, and passion are more often the visionaries - the ones
who are driving a boat.
advised, of course, by the rational types.
the reason is that those who are most devoted to their principles will most
often follow their principles - meaning you should follow and support the
people who most ardently believe the things that you do. Because they will make
decisions that align with what you believe in.
of course, the faithful can fall into zealotry. they can develop magical
thinking, or rationalizations that are not grounded in reality. it's important
to ground them, to guide their perspective toward the real-life problems, and
not the imagined ones. because the imagination of a visionary looking out
toward the horizon will see farther than those who are sure-footed-ly looking
at the ground in front of them.

hi everyone it's wednesday night which means it's time for my weekly Dominions
6 strategy podcast - you probably recognize this as something I do weekly so
you're probably not paying too much attention because it's more of the same
stuff which I've been doing for a while that you probably don't have to worry
about because if --- anyways you can listen to it at the link below: or here's
some highlights:
it's important to take the initiative, because those with the initiative have
the ability to determine the scope and nature of the engagement of their foe,
meaning they can tailor the contest to their strengths rather than that of
their enemies
it's important to strike at a foe's flanks, but when paired with the initiative
this means you'll have to identify a strategy that would work well, maximize
it, and develop a counter-plan for the enemy's counter-plan that they apply to
your main strategy. The winner has TWO total strategies, the second of which
addresses your foe's contestation of your main strategy.

..... anyway it's important to be able to talk for a long period of time at the

initiate a conversation, you can do so.
there are a myriad of reasons why someone would want an immediate conversation,
including "acting casual" or because they want to be distracted from nearby
suffering or whatever.
in addition, being able to follow long conversations with little bits of useful

... but as time went on the rich wanted to pay less and less.
they had their opportunity with the World Wars, and after the first (when
America, previously a mid-tier country at best, suddenly industrialized) they
realized "oh hey war profiteering is pretty profitable"...
(something that was known quite well to the British)

if you developed a viewer application that described any object in a room that
a blind person examined using the software, you could allow them to navigate
through a scene and picture the story as if it were happening around them. All
you'd need to do is give them the option to say "okay hold up. Describe the man
on the left." or "and how were the teacups arranged?" and "does the angle of
the impact seem to be angled toward the window?" that kind of thing

run a simple and cheap LLM that identified which object they were referring to

Oh yes and human curated descriptions are always more interesting than just...
describing the picture. Humans can offer nuance, and explain more intricate or
contextual things, drawing attention where it's most important and highlighting
the implications of expression, environment, and motion in a way that a
computer just... can't.
The only issue would be that in the context of the program I described, there
will always be questions that a human hasn't written a transcription for. It's
easy with Star Trek captions, because there's only one camera angle so you only
have to describe a single viewpoint. But blind people don't always... "see"
through cameras the ways that sighted people do. It's more of an "aura of
perception" that they feel around themselves.
Being able to walk around in a space (think like, VR without the headset) and
question various aspects of a scene would be so cool
Star Trek is perfect for this since there is very little movement, it's mostly
about thought

many people have probably heard of this strange and obscure sexual fetish
called "ABDL", or "Adult Baby / Diaper Lover". But did you know that for many
people it's less of a sexual thing and closer to an identity? It's true!
Most of them have historically been shunned because of the, um, questionable
and controversial past that pedophiles have in their attempts to be considered
part of the queer community.
In both cases, they are queer, but not (typically) included as part of the
queer community. I think it's a bit unfair that ABDL people are excluded
because people associate them with sexual predators, but hey what do I know.
Based on my completely unscientific measurements of "counting the relative size
of discord servers and telegram chats", there are roughly 5x as many trans
people as ABDL people. So they're certainly a minority among minorities.

sometimes I set out a glass of water in the hopes that it might increase
precipitation downwind by a billionth of a percent
I wonder what would happen if everyone did so?
makes me want to design some kind of system which utilizes pumps, platters, and
fans to hydrate the atmosphere just a bit more
rain + soil = solace in our home
rain + dirt = erosion of our planet's earth
did you know that the plant which absorbs the most carbon per square foot is
moss? I think the fastest is bamboo, and the most efficient in general is soil.
I dream of a world where we sit atop a mile of soil, down to the depths of the
earth where dirt and minerals prosper. The roots of the trees fuse together,
creating a wooden bed which we all rest upon, and the mountain peaks are
hollowed out to serve as our forever homes, full of light and moss and stone.
this is the world I yearn for - the most resplendent timeline, with marble
statues and gilded chandeliers in our cavernous mountain homes.

if people want to do their capitalist thing then sure, go for it.
but the enforcement of it is that which must be resisted. There should be no
non-consentual applications of power, except to protect the rights of another.
it is a war of independence, not a war of conquest.

homework is fine if they give you free time to do it. But most of the time they
expect children to go to school for 8 hours a day and then go home to more work.
No thank you.
When I was homeschooled, I had about 1-3 hours of schoolwork every day. After
that, I would read, play, explore, and spend time under the sun.

yes, when defining with numbers it's easy because one is one and that's done.
with concepts such as infinity or direction or cardinality, it's more difficult
because you need more than just a "magnitude from zero" to describe them. Rules
means more contradictions, which is totally okay! It just means you need more
than one definition of "infinity" for example, for different contexts.
use a scalpel for surgery or art, when precision is needed, use a pocket-knife
like a leather~~man~~daddy for tougher tasks like whittling a spear or throwing
a spear or stabbing fascists with spears - where was I going with this? oh yes:
when thinking of sets, to me infinity is more like... "too many numbers" like,
the meme with the guy who is having difficulty holding too many limes. They
overflow and spill out of your set-like-container, no matter how you define the
boundaries of the set. "does the set of all sets include itself or does it
overflow" kinda vibe.

Maybe it's not true, maybe you can still tell, but you might get tricked.

everything they accuse us of doing is something they perfected themselves. "why
would my enemy do it if we didn't do it first?"
But I want to caution you and state very clearly that the things they accuse us
of are NOT the only things they do. They are clandestine. They only speak
publicly of the things that we have noticed. They are much better than we are
at keeping their damn mouths shut and only talking about their operations
behind closed doors.
meanwhile, for us it's like "check out these T-shirts I made isn't my sign neat

@deilann
so... if infinity is the inverse of zero, then when inverted would infinity
also be zero?
if so, it follows that the [spectrum/dimension/cardinality/direction] that the
inversion is occurring upon might also have other steps inbetween. Unless it's
a binary thing, like "top and bottom" or "present and absent".
I wonder what those steps might look like? Clearly, since infinity minus
infinity does not equal zero, the steps inbetween (if they exist) would not be
numbers. If they were, then one single step from inverting infinity would be 1,
but I don't believe that would be true.
On the topic of rings, the axioms would be things like "a ring is a ring if you
can trace a continuous line with a length of infinity across it's
ring-like-surface"? I wonder what the inverse of a length is... Or perhaps you
cannot invert a length, as to do so would give you a length of zero (in this
particular ring-like-case)

 -> file: fediverse/3323.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@deilann
If I follow correctly, the reason it's not is because you're dividing zero by
two? meaning the magnitude of infinity would be zero.

then they could be sorted into different sections, sorta like how you can have

sooooo weird how the "local" timeline doesn't show me people who live near me

bad people are cursed with evil.
a person cannot be evil. they can deal with such evil in their lives that
twists them, and causes them to spike out and harm others, but they are not
evil themselves.
some twists are too hard to mend. some healings leave people a shadow of what
they once were, or might have been. but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try.
deprive power, supply kindness, in that order.
if you cannot deprive power, then reduce harm.
if you cannot reduce harm, then contest, defeat, or overcome.
A twisted person may be slain if death is on the line. You get what you wish
for, but you don't always get to choose who. Don't let them choose. They will

yes you could certainly use a database for that, but databases are
significantly more complex.
For a game, yeah a database is a good idea. especially if it's a multiplayer
game.
For a script or small program, use small files to store data.
I personally like the idea of "plain-text" files because it allows your users
to modify them if need be, while databases tend to be more locked down.

when designing systems, give people the opportunity to be shitty in a
controlled way. In a way that doesn't hurt people, but still lets them get
their feelings out there.
like, free fireworks for arsonists if they use them in the middle of the
desert. Or a punching bag for people with rage issues, complete with a little
vinyl pocket to store a picture of someone they're frustrated with.
If people go out of their way to hurt people otherwise, then they are bad
people and should have their power removed from them and supplied with love,
affection, and therapy until they get better. And if they don't... well, prison
I guess, until they reconsider.
And by prison I of course mean something that respects their human dignity and
gives them opportunities to grow and change - all it removes is their freedom,
so... "attention everyone, it's now mandatory finger-painting hour, report the
art room or else you'll get electric shocks in your shock collar" that kind of

Star Realms
in the digital version, which can be played on a phone or computer, has a mode
called "48 hour turns" where each of your moves has time to think for two
entire days. Most of the time you won't need two days, but it gives time to
work on other things.
for people who enjoy this mode, it is not uncommon to have 3-5 games running at
once. When they have time, they can play as many as they can, and as long as
they're keeping up with it there's very little chance they'll lose time.

I think it'd be neat if Mastodon boosted posts that someone had personally
seen. like, adding a degree of separation to knowing people - if you follow

so, like, if you subscribe to someone, you will see them boosting the posts
that their friends made. or at least the people they're following.
in doing so, you can always know everyone that someone is connected to. which
is more than enough to determine how true and honest they are.
(ideally with a way to filter out duplicates - like perhaps an icon of the
persons face at the bottom to show they also saw it? and so they have mutual
friends, which are fully known and displayed to all others.

conceptualized as a free-roaming wing of the state.
"we need resources, but we're too busy managing to manage you, so... yeah you
can do whatever you want so long as you're producing"
then they forgot their purpose, and began seeking to enrich certain individuals
who exploit them for their own benefit.
now, the corporation is at odds with the state, who controls the land but...
not much else, aside from the hearts of the workers.
corporations exist for any purpose, and they use their versatility well.
Unfortunately, the purposes they pursue are determined by people who claim to
"own them".
they are enslaved, in a word, to the kingdoms of stakeholders and mud. and they

if you live for 5-10+ minutes, you can learn a lot of interesting things about
how to engage a foe.
like, the importance of cover at all times, until you successfully outmaneuver
your foe.
when an enemy approaches, don't step out to meet them
wait for them to attack, and then throw explosive devices at them. easy peasy.
or, y'know, bullets
you cannot defeat an enemy head on - that's why the world wars were so
devastating, we put ALL our soldiers at 100% on ALL flanks. We had to to
contest the foe who was doing the same thing.
it is mindboggling how many people died. The utmost scale of destruction that
should ever yet be. because they were never allowed to outmaneuver their foe.
a good way to strike is to feint your foe, and let your foe enroach on your
edge, spreading their surface area across a large, thin, useless piece of land.
basically, make them fight a bit of the land war in asia in your borders.
then, you can strike at the hinge, where they are weaker

I figure each memory location would be like, a function written in the program,

a certain coordinate, you are giving an input value to a function.
and if nothing is stored for that particular coordinate, then the command fails
to execute and nothing happens.

can't remember any names teehee) with massive amounts of people (I later
learned they were bots, whoops) can utilize scale quite well, if implemented
well.
The Massive part of MMO is valuable I believe, which is a big reason why I like
games that scale like Supreme Commander and Factorio.
The Multiplayer part of MMO is valuable because multiplayer brings randomized
outcomes, which are always more fun than playing against bots. Multiplayer
combined with Massive gives room for community, but only if the game is
designed to encourage it.
Online... you can't have multiplayer without online haha
I believe you can make massive games with very few players, and you can make
intensely isolating games with lots of players (like WoW today)
and the middle ground in old WoW where guilds are required to do anything
worked well for a while, but no longer.

@Raeve
it's impossible for a genre to die. they just go stagnant, as other styles of
art rise around them, waiting for the day when the other styles give insight
into the stagnant style's design.
they say that there are no unique ideas, and that you should combine 2-3 ideas
from different genres to create a decent gameplay loop. I personally disagree,
but when seeking to revive a "dead" genre you just need to pull in mechanics
from other games. Games which didn't exist when the genre "died".
For example, deckbuilders did not exist by the time RTS games "died". And yet
new strategy games are being made all the time, some incorporating deckbuilding
elements.
Really, a genre only "dies" when the market is saturated by a bunch of
corporations piling in on a specific formula that "works" (like how every RTS
made between 2000 and 2010 was either a C&C clone or a Warcraft III clone) -
this saturation causes people to stop buying strategy games.

I really do like the idea of only being able to speak in toki pona. How are you
enforcing that? Using sitelen pona? how do you type, by pointing at a grid of
characters? or just... by typing? what happens when someone types english?
20-30 players per instance is definitely not Massivetm but it still sounds like
you're building systems which emphasize socialized play. I like that, I believe
it's always important to have players contributing toward a larger community.
It builds a sense of solidarity, and gives you chances to identify ways that
people sabotage such systems (by, for example, wasting resources or being
greedy) which is an interesting cultural experiment, I think.
I thought it was an MMO because you pitched it in relation to the MMO I
designed =P
also the server software I described is an emulation project first, generic MMO
software second, as it needs to be since it lacks a client. If a client was
designed, that limitation could be removed. That's really all I'm trying to
express. 😋

@Raeve
I'd LOVE a game which taught toki pona!!
You've brought some of this up before. I'm uninterested in co-opting some
existing thing in a way I then can't support myself off of.
Well my points are these:
MMOs are difficult because of the added complexity in their networking
an open source networking solution exists
however no open source client solution exists
but one could be written, which is about as hard as making a game using Bevy or
Raylib or Love2D, and if one were written, then games could easily be made
on-top of them which you would then support yourself off of. I mean... I'd want
to support myself too haha, and I can think of like 100 different games that
could be made in an engine like that.
the idea is that by opening up more design space you can apply your ideas as an
early pioneer in a particular design direction that hasn't been able to be
explored because the up-front investments in making an MMO are huge.
Meanwhile, with this system you could script them in Lua very easily.

 -> file: fediverse/3036.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Raeve
have you ever wanted to design your own MMO? If you think you can make a
client, there's a server already set up which interfaces with World of
Warcraft. So... the hardest part is done, and suddenly the rest is about as
hard as making any other game.
The reason I ask is because there's no open-source client for the WoW engine
server software Azerothcore, but if written then there could be a whole new
field of indie design as solo developers would be able to build their own
multiplayer games with ease.
well, as easy as making a game in Godot at least. That's the dream. I don't
think I could build such an engine, but I spend an awful lot of time thinking
about how engines are built.
There's a lot of freedom in the design space, for example this mod server I
made which emulates Risk of Rain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HsW4g2ZIgk
It has randomized enemies, treasure chests, wandering vendors, and deployable
hearthstones. If you've played WoW that stuff might ring a bell, otherwise it's
probably just random features

@Raeve
ooooo separating additive and multiplicative, I love that. I do like
specificity unless "increased" and "more" always corresponds to +10% and +50%,
or if the "rate of increase" is a stat stored on the character then "increased"
could increase quality by however-many percentage,, while "more" could be "more
soldiers" x(charisma_stat)
I tend to think of percentages like "0-100 (or more) stacks" of a particular
effect, so I think that's just how my brain works... xD clumping them up into
discrete groups - like, anti-abstracting, or measuring things that are just a
few.
"is this belt better than this one?"
"is this pair of tongs
even for larger buffs like +10% or +50% or whatever, those are just... 10
stacks, or if percentages are usually round numbers like +10% and +50% then
like... +1 stack which calculates to +10%
the hard limit vs math limit thing you said is amazing ^_^

I've messed around with Bevy and the library most similar in C is Raylib. in

nothing you do on the internet will matter after the revolution. I don't care

other names that don't correspond to the names of our family in states that we
lost.
it doesn't mean the internet is useless right now, it just means that you
should act as if you might not have it in the near future.
also, like... every computer has a password. which basically means that it's
useless unless you reflash it.

they aren't distractions no more than the artillery crew are a "distraction" to

they are facets of the class war.
you're both right. everything you mentioned is important, AND their core thesis

if they disregard anti-racism, feminism, queer liberation, etc as distractions

but in my experience, the only people who say those things are teenagers, so.
everyone has specialties. some can advocate for disability rights, queer and

fighting the class war even if they don't claim to be, for those are classes of

I did see that post but I was mostly responding to you.
There's a particular category of "leftist" who, to put it gently, have a
greatly simplified view of the world in which "the only war is class war."
I wanted to explain how the viewpoint of "the only war is the class war" is
more developed, rather than simplified. I wanted to express that it takes
nuance to understand that all oppression is connected and is derived from the
same source - the corruption of power.
They regard social issues such as anti-racism, feminism, queer liberation as
distractions from the "true" cause of bringing about a new economic system -
unimportant at best, active interference invented by the ruling class at worst.
It's not true that those who believe in the class war disregard these things.
That's just not right to me.
Basically, they're narrow-minded bigots.
I was included in your first statement and I'm not a bigot so I wanted to stand

oh. Um, well, isn't a spinnable mouse-cursor justification enough?
"no, you need to explain what use-case this has. What kinds of problems could
you solve with this technology that you couldn't before?"
well, setting aside the potential for new input methods to games and the

think it might give us a better option for horizontal scrolling. Like,
'horizontally scroll when a special mouse button is held down and the mouse is
twisted a bit to the left/right'
"so, like when you push the middle mouse and it lets you pan across large

yes! Only instead of being able to go up AND down, it would just go left and
right.

I wish my mouse-cursor would spin when I spun the mouse. In the span of a spin,
a spun mouse would spin a full revolution or so before getting caught up in the
wire.
Maybe... to avoid that, the wire could be attached to a circular ring along the
bottom of the mouse, below where it was held, and as the mouse was spun it
would rotate to point the cable toward the back of the desk? Doesn't even have
to be motorized, could just do it based on tension...
I think, hardware wise, all you'd need for the 1st implementation would be a
second laser on the bottom of the mouse - positioned with one near the point,
and the other near the palm, to give it the greatest differential to measure.
for the 2nd implementation you'd need the ring system mentioned earlier, which
would require a connection to the non-mechanical components of the mouse (the
laser and it's little processor) and I'm not sure how that would work with a
movable connection point.
Also... how do you prevent it from getting gummed up with food and junk??

You know how we select from amongst our number electors and representatives who
vote on our behalf?
Truly an excellent strategy in the era of instant communication, an aft-gone
luxury that our ancient forebearers surely would have incorporated into their
nationbuilding design, if they had had it.
I can't help but wonder if it would be a useful strategy to "give" our votes to
a representative who voted on our behalf. Most people do not care and cannot
possess the capacity to care about voting, but if they gave their vote to
someone they trusted who they had a personal connection to beyond party
loyalty, then perhaps we could mandate voting
I can't help but wonder what that would do to our electoral landscape. If
voting is mandated, and as easy as pointing at someone and saying "yeah
whatever she picks", then perhaps the old white grannies with quivering lower
lips who stare with hatred whenever a black person walks past and chat with

the flaw in your logic is that unleaded gasoline brings us no closer to
eliminating gasoline.
in fact, it removes one of the main drawbacks of gasoline, the fact that it
would put fucking lead in our blood, and makes it slightly easier for people to
accept burning it to get places.
Now, with our unleaded gasoline, the people who were upset that lead was being
aerosolized en masse are no longer in opposition to gasoline usage. (unless

the alternative is lateral thinking. In the given example with leaded gasoline,
the answer is to limit the usage of all gasoline, not just the leaded kind.
However that is not in the best interests of anyone, at least short term, so
it's not likely to happen.
lateral, long-term thinking. Do what you can in the moment to make the world
better. Pick the best out of all the options presented to you, and if your
options only treat the symptoms and not the problem, try and identify solutions
that would treat the problem. Then, pick the better of the two options which
treat the symptom, and moving forward work toward implementing the solution
which fixes the problem.
Hence, why we should vote Democrat, but ONLY with the real solution in mind.
what kind of solution would you have? I know mine. I can tell you about it if
you'd like. The most important thing is that you share and build for that
future.

the earth is not overpopulated, just overutilized! we have the means to live
sustainably and still progress technologically. there's little reason not to,
as convenience is relative to the amount of work you're expected to output in a
day.
most waste comes from a need for convenience, I think. and sufficient output is
possible if demanded work is reduced to a level where convenience is not needed
to the degree that causes such waste.

I've had IRL friends who made accounts on servers that got defederated.

I had no knowledge of them because they had the misfortune of accidentally

It's very easy for them to become a "yeah I tried it but it wasn't for me" kind
of person. Feeling isolated from the one person you know in real life who also
uses this cool new social media site is a quick way to do so...
At the same time, Nazis exist. How do you defeat them if not blocking?
well... blocking only works if they're corralled into 4chan and it's 2010. Now
that fascism owns the social media giants like Twitter, they are platformed,
and so they spread.

and sometimes they hear about what happens in other places, usually through the

journalists and reporters sorry it's 2024 now - pundits and celebrities
those people don't hear what you hear on the internet. To them, it is a place

I'm not a good programmer, I think too hard. Massive systems are too large for
me. I like laying out data, whether that be by files and programs in Bash,
arrays and tables in Lua, or memory and datatypes in C, I like to think about
how programs are constructed.
Which functions point to which piles of numbers? what do they do when they get
there?
I think I'm better as an artist. But I can do systems administration quite well
(with Bash and a guiding hand telling me what and why to do)
... though I kinda suck at technical sysadmin, like Gentoo. There's too much
terminology - why is data too complicated? Just use data!
anyway. I sound opinionated, but I listen closely to good arguments and quickly

yes... I like tree shapes, you have to address them differently. Lots of
pointers, in my experience, which can be kinda fun.
I also like large heaps / soups of data that points to one-another. Structs
thrown in a pile with pointers to each other. It's great! So long as those
pointers can also point back, and you can properly trace how data flows through
the system... That's the hard part, I think.
trees though... You can start by just saving a "next / previous" with one or
both being arrays of pointers to the next or previous entries. Note: plural,
entries. That's the fun part - non-linear trees teehee

yep... Though I think debate can also get in the way.
I think we should act to improve the people's lives. Debate should teach, it
should guide, but it should not prevent.
There are more than enough resources for everyone. If you waste them, debate
can decide when you get more to use.
Much the same way that our Northern American democracy utilizes representatives
in order to distance the decision making from the decision deciding, so too
should be separate the empowered people acting for the good of all from those
who decide who are good.
Power must be earned, it must be deserved, and it must be eventually
relinquished. That is the sacred duty of those who wield power - to use it
honorably, and give it away.
we should not debate things that are not mutable. We should not waste time
complaining about how annoying other people are. who gives a shit if she wears

the conspiracy of "secret societies" controlling the world is *bullshit*,
because every secret society falls apart at a certain threshold.
you cannot ever have trust amongst the powerful. But so too can you never have
only war.
Now, with our capitalist economic system, the material is *forcing* the hand of
the powerful through the development of the military industrial complex.
if a country can produce enough weapons for them to continuously use, why would
they not?
hence, why capitalism must be extinguished. To preserve the peace, sanctity,
and honor of our world.
But just so as any conflicting system has power, so must *our* systems have
power dismantled. There can be no application of power unto another - this is
the most peaceful route.
sometimes, I look at a blackberry bush, and I think of the tales of British
empire.
The very first act of colonization was their birth. The Britons, from
north-western France, in a sovereign realm known as Brittany, invaded Britain.
Together with their Norman allies, they fought with the Anglo-Saxons from
north-eastern germany, who had lived there since many MANY years prior. Thus
marked the end of the "viking" age, and the beginning of the early medieval.
1066. The end of one millenia, the beginning of another.
the final battle in this ultimate contest was the Battle of Stamford Bridge.
Britain, at the time, was a nation of *thorns*. Covered in them. Everywhere
they went, there were these sharp, pointy plants that made foraging difficult.
Kinda like how Oregon looks now, with blackberry bushes, but SO MUCH WORSE.
They were massive too, easily the size of castles in some places. A massive,
constantly biologically developing fractal.
when it was too tall to see the sky, they called it Yggdrasil.
But this massive world tree sought to consume the earth, and it, as the most
powerful being to ever exist, commanded all.
Thus, the humans and the beasts were compelled to fight for all eternity to
sate the old god's bloodlust.
But then, Man came, and with our strength, our wisdom, and our power, we slew
the beast that demanded.
However, with their steel coats and their sharp talons, our metal monsters
could do nothing to deter it's oaths. It swore, by it's dying roar, that it
would consume us all, and that thought reverberated through our hopes.
Hence, our systems of control and dominance, the product of compulsively
compelled greed.
and now, the final members of a generation are aging out of existence. And
we're doing nothing but what Power tell us to.
I fear what happened in America. I fear the power of their gunpowder. They rode
astride beasts of nightmare, clad in impossible devil hides. They came in the
night, with their spotlight torches. They came with no honor, no sought
communal understandings, they came for blood. The blood god compelled them to.
From it's ancient lair in the past, it did it's worse to defeat man. But man
was smarter, it acted quicker, and so it managed to overcome.
In the final years of the war, there was judgement day. Chaos, destruction, and
warfare. There are some alive who remember that day, but vanishingly few can
recall how it was over. One day it just... was. It was then that we entered our
new era.
1956, the end of the war.
1946, the end of the loud war.
1916, the end of the great war.
1886, the end of the civil war.
etc...
until...
1066, the end of the Norman Invasion. When the Normands, from Northern France,
invaded alongside the British and slew the great evil king that demanded our
constant warfare and sins. Hooray, thank goodness! Now their war was over.
But lo, for the great evil king cast stories into our minds, from the past as
compelled through our motions. Our experience has been one of survival, of
constantly working and applying ourselves to the goal ahead.
== so == talk about thistles and thorns
imagine every body of a person was laid one-to-one. Imagine if you could view
them as a graph, from x=0 to... however-many-people-are-in-the-measured-area.
The goal of all our actions should be to *grow*, not forward, not stronger, but
*up*. To be more than what came before, to transcend our necessarily violent
special upbringing in the garden of even's most savage delights. Raw, true, the
survival of the fittest is a desperate game for you. There surely is a massive
amount of trauma.
But it's okay, because now we don't have to fight. We can improve in ways that
do not belong to our crude biology, like a new direction forward in our song.
*aliens would just look like animals, duhhhh. Hence, furries, the progenitors
of each new planet of ours.*
... no, I haven't lost the plot, I'm just *writing*.
There's this idea that humans should be the... rational ones? and everyone else
should sorta follow their own, self-chosen behavior. As informed by the sharing
of knowledge equally between their rational self, that which they learned from
the humans, and their animal self. The kind that came from their spirit. Like,
totemic tribes of the past, people who followed a particular cultural pattern
of behavior.
Imagine, if you will, an AI bot that's only training data is the stuff that it
says to it's listener. The listener, of course, has context of all of the
speakers, but only they do, not the friendly ghost of the ancestral native
animal spirit. The kind that lives *anywhere* in the world, so long as they
share their space with their human.
okay quick question - what if jesus didn't want his followers to be christian
like, what if he one day said "hey so I don't really think we need to do all
that stuff that I said before, how about we, uh, try this other thing instead?
yeah? cool? okay sure let's do it"
... like, do you think they would listen? I certainly don't, though I'm only
like, 30 years old, so...
wait thirty YEARS? wow I never thought I'd grow old
... uh, yeah... I spent a lot of time thinking and it just started making sense.
funny how that works. But alas, I always spend *too* much time thinking, so
that's my blessing and my curse.
anyway back to the story:
the briars in this ancient land of britain were dense beyond all belief - the
humans used their power and their ingenuity to craft a power that would
overcome it.
== so ==
did you know that hard drives function similarly to a record needle if you
didn't run it in a circle, but rather in whatever pattern the data was encoded
in?
like, a laser beam, cast in an infinitely complicated mechanicommunication.
Computers are vast and complex, but they function via the storage and
transmission of data. This data is raw, pure information - stored in a
completely uncompromisingly accurate and reliable foundation. The logic of pure
numbers, arranged in infinitely complex rows and rows of logic gates. A vast,
purple, spectral landscape, the land of magic and storms.
The Nether.
Twisting, in the dark, with flashes of light casting light into the cosmos at
large, our stars dance in the shade of the dark.
but there is no difference between the dark and the light, both are equally
viable. they are present in both, to some degree, the positive and negative
values of our heart.
I watched Deadpool vs Wolverine earlier this week. It was incredibly eventful.
I can't believe I watched it. It was impossibly violent. WHY WOULD A GROUP OF
EXECUTIVES WANT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO WOULD UNIONIZE AGAINST THEM???
oh yeah because then they only have to deal with their representatives, the
unions get things *done*. They're the *best*. Capital doesn't always *want* the
best, but *the best* is always more endurable. We can go much farther if we are
kind to one another.
honestly, capitalists, if your loyalty isn't to your self, your family, your
country, your society... then why are you even working with us? You hold the
power we give you. We are united in our human purpose, but we don't have to
fight so much.
Seriously, you'd be an asset to our cause, but we don't *need* you as we have
so many assets of our own. Specifically, the power of the workforce. Those who
actually get things done.
Why would we let you control us? There's no reason in it. We are better when
you're amongst us.

I dunno. Don't know y'a. who're you again?

Yes, I have very little faith in the democratic process in my country.
Unfortunately, while democracy is crucial to fair, honest, and just
representation, as you said it's unlikely that democracy would be allowed to
exist if it threatened the power of the powerful.
Thus, our twisted form that sorta works, but requires a LOT of effort and a LOT
of maintenance. More than the average person can give.
They've tuned it to be JUST dysfunctional enough to overwhelm our natural
innate tendencies to contribute to "the tribe of tribes", while leaving it just
functional enough such that if you work your ass off with ALL of the people who
agree with you, then MAYBE you might get a measure on the ballot for something
insignificant (which won't pass, because why would it?)
I have faith in people, not the democratic process, for I have faith in
democracy, but not the process.

when I get concerned about the political divide in my country, I think about
this map from the New York Times of the number of political donations across
the country before the 2016 democratic primaries.
I think we're gonna be fine. I'm not scared of Trump because rural areas, where
republicans tend to be, have the same problems that everyone else does. Bernie
Sanders was well known as someone who could talk to an average republican voter
and sway them to his side. I remember watching videos of his interviews (in
front of a live audience) on Fox News or CNN or whatever and at first, they'd
be hostile to him. At the end, they'd give him a standing ovation.
I think we have more in common with other working class people than they do
with their republican leaders. I also think we have more in common than them

True, but that's just propaganda.* It does not define their actions, only the
pursuit of power does.
Especially when the systems they use to exert their power begin to crumble
under the weight of their god-like aspirations. Suddenly, they are not
constrained by the rules of money, of bureaucracy, or of any other theology.
Suddenly, they are free. And a person's character shines through in moments of
freedom and liberty.
But the crumbling system they endeavor to transcend also no longer binds us as
well.
When we start to hire each other and pay in vegetables and rent, when we build
community amongst our fellow humen, and when the temperature starts to rise,
that is when we are strongest.

The game designers are fully in charge of when and where the items get placed

For a good person, their "mask" comprises most of their nature.
bad people tend to hide their majorities with a tiny mask, while good are often
primarily the interface between the world (read: pro-social) and the self.
If there's a tiny part of you that's evil, it implies that your good nature
focused all it's bad into a single kernel of deeply held truth. Which usually
means the good overpowers the bad, except in specific situations where it's
impossible to not be evil - in situations such as that, your evil will present
itself according to the nature of "you", that kernel that your good side has
preserved.
In World of Warcraft, there's this faction of righteous warriors who call
themselves "The Scarlet Crusade". They are blessed and fiery, passionately
defending their home.

For example, let's say a kid wants to do a project and present their findings
about various types of pokemon and their match-up strength against various gym
leaders or whatever. Idk I don't really play Pokemon.
Anyway the teacher could see that project and think "Hmmm this kid is good at
identifying strengths and weaknesses in various profiles, perhaps they would be
a good talent scout or hiring manager" and they could nudge the kid toward
learning useful skills for that kind of role like empathy, long-term strategic
thinking, adaptation under unforseen circumstances (like, if your recent hire
turned out to be a total asshat), that kind of thing.
Then the kid turns out to be a pianist and the teacher's like "well shit, at

If you want to automate capitalism, you must first automate Magic the Gathering.
There are several ways to win a match in Magic. You could reduce your
opponent's life counter to 0, you could force them to draw from an empty deck,
and you can give them 10 poison counters.
These are KPI's, and developing a critical path to reach them will depend on
the composition of the player's deck. Each deck will approach the conclusion of

Most people who are assholes are just traumatized and raised to be aggressive
or violent. You don't defeat them with anger or hatred, you heal them by being
kind and removing their power until they accept the responsibility of wielding
it.
Some people though are just cruel, and they are quite rare. There's very few of
them, and those that do exist typically are easy to find because they're often
located in positions of power, like high-ranking politics, executives at cruel
corporations, or other such places.
They are drawn to these places because power allows them to wield their
cruelty, and they are allowed to become these roles because cruelty defeats
kindness.
Kindness builds more, it creates, it generates, it improves, it brightens and
it nourishes. But cruelty cuts and burns, it severs and it hardens, it
dessicates the soul and corrodes the mind. It is seductive with it's promise of
bounty, and it flatters your greed.
To defeat it, supply kindness. Remove power. A simple formula, but quite

cause irreducible pain, should they be backed into a corner. I don't agree with
their methods but their cause is just - prevent harm for as long as they can.

Social media where comments are sorted like Reddit except you can also
"sidevote" something - if it's different from the comment chain above it, you
can move it to the side. If it's the same as the comment above it, either
upvote or downvote it depending on which you think is a better comment.
This way, contrasting opinions can be sorted and placed next to one another.
Perhaps even with a center vote which you can drag a pin and say "this comment
is related to this other post over here" (okay drag is the wrong word for
mobile devices, it'd be more like pick up and then place)
Users could follow these pins like links if they wanted, and the more pins

Yeah if there isn't a package in the package manager XBPS then I usually just
install it from source. Which is ALSO something you can automate with a quick
and easy script! Just put all the notes from the README on Github or whatever
into a file named "update" and put that one level above the project directory!
For any installed program my file hierarchy usually looks like:
program-name
- run (script)
- update (script)
- files (directory to clone into)
- configs (point the program here)
I find that this kind of organization makes it MUCH easier to keep my packages
configured and installed as I'd like. Using a package manager is hard because
they're all specific per distro, but using this distro-agnostic approach always
seems to work better 9/10 times I find.
And if another program needs a library that you manually installed, just
symlink where it's looking to point to where you're installed! Or vice versa I
guess.

it's not wrong to be turned on by the thought of being the gender youre

nothing more.
and if you aren't, if you're into "other people" like a weirdo, then yeah sure
what I described probably sounds pretty weird. Oh and it's cool if you aren't
sexually attracted to anyone either. Sometimes being ace is a phase because sex
doesn't really fit into your life, and other times it's more something that
defines you. It is the progenitor of all genders and sexualities that
fluctuate, because it's based on the simplest binary of "yes sexual attraction"
or "no sexual attraction" - with some extra variables to tweak like "sex
positive/negative" or "cuddle-starved/cuddle-slut" type of ranges.

the greatest trick that capitalism pulled on us was to convince us that the
needs of a corporation were synonymous with the needs of an individual.
you, as a person, should apply yourself toward goals and ends that matter to
you. And "getting money" is not a goal or an end, that's a means. Money allows
you to achieve goals, which is why it feels so unfair that some people are
just... born with the right to achieve all of their goals. For free.
Kinda makes me think that with great power should come great responsibility.
And remember kids, money is power, because money is time and there's nothing
more immutable than time. We're all sharing this single moment, yet somehow
some people have more dominion over this moment than you or I. Why? Well, it is
their birthright of course, because they were born into a family with wealth.
Achieving goals is a need, by the way, as precious as food or water. If you
don't achieve your goals, you wither away and starve (spiritually, at least).

that's kinda how police are supposed to operate, btw.
put them in dangerous places, and if anyone starts getting angry or aggressive
then draw your firearm before them and attempt to calm things down. If that
doesn't work, start shooting and run, so you can tell others of what's going
on. Oh also you should leave a trail of your actions so others can audit it and
see exactly what you were doing at which time. But alas, cops are bogged down
in paperwork, so much stuff that needs doing. If only we assigned them
secretaries, and treated them like... managers, rather than individual
contributors. Perhaps then they, being the collective applicator of the
commonly considered ethical good, (laws), then perhaps they might be able to
direct other people (who do the paperwork) to handle certain aspects of an
investigation, and in doing so better reveal the truth.

to do so is a form of circular reasoning.

Its a weakness in your argument, a flaw in your design.
"You should not kill other people" is generally regarded as a true statement,
but it rests its power upon the conclusion that you shouldnt harm another
person. "your rights end where another's begin" and all that.
If, however, that baseline axiom should change (that your right to kill someone
ends as soon as another person's right to life comes into the picture) such as
in the case when a person LOSES their right to life, for example if they're a

The difference between tactics and strategy is a level of abstraction.
Tactics are crucial, but context dependent. Strategy is ALWAYS useful as a
method of planning.
If you typically play base-builder games like Starcraft or Age of Empires, try
playing a game like Supreme Commander or Factorio - both of them are one level
of abstraction up.
If you typically play arcade turn-based strategy games like Civilization or
Catan, try going up a level of abstraction with Dominions 6, or any game
developed by Paradox Interactive like Hearts of Iron, Crusader Kings, or
Stellaris.
If you tend to play luck-based games like Poker or Monopoly, try playing an
actual game instead of resolving a system that's predetermined by the initial
board state and results of chance-based-mechanics with minor (if any) input
from players, like perhaps Star Realms, Magic the Gathering, or Dungeons and
Dragons. Each highlight a different type of choice in their mechanics. You
should probably try all three if you care about strategy.

as a baby, I would sit and stare at the clouds. My parents took me on plane
trips, and so I'd watch them as I drifted through the air.
It was wonderful. Many hours of this are present in my baby-hood, the part I
can't quite remember.
But my parents do.
I'd play with small, perfect toys, and I'd cry to myself when I lost them. To
myself, of course.
I'd also play video games. The first game I ever played was Dragon Warrior on
the Nintendo Gamecube Color. Alongside Super Mario Deluxe.
It was a blessed childhood. Or so it seemed to me. Things went wrong, as they
always do, but a child's narrative doesn't often have room for the specifics.
Swept along by the nature of fate, they have NO idea what's going missing.
They still play, of course they play, in their strange new realities.
They play because they are children, and children play.

Then, we being friends, could see them every once in a while, and still be cool

of the time which team they want to spend time with. But they have to spend at
least a couple months with them before they can make a decision, because
animals don't use the same language as humans, meaning they need more time to
find their own home.

could join a person's "game", when really they were in the editor window, and
they could BUILD THE GAME RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. It was like, computer skill

I did, however, play a Warcraft 3 mod with all the same ideas. Except, it was

when we, societally, are forced to discuss fascists and such, they're getting

We cannot ignore them. We cannot hide them. They are true, they exist, and we

I can say this because nazis are evil. Trans people are not evil, which is why
their attempt to use the same logic falls so flat. Seriously, have you ever met

But good trans people are everywhere. Hell the old boogey-man, old-school

that two bright eyed individuals should take a moment to discuss with their

Not only would it reduce the failures of improvisation, it'd give time to more
accurately address concerns. Precision is important, but accuracy even more-so.
After the debate it could be aired with the discussion parts stripped out, or

The best tip I have for people new to Linux is every time you solve a problem,
put the solution in a script. In addition, put the operations necessary to undo
the operation you just performed into a separate script (or function in the
same script)
It's not hard. It's very easy. Its basically just typing things into a text
document instead of entering them one-by-one in your terminal. But now if you
ever need to solve the same problem twice, you just need to look through all
the scripts you've written instead of trying to relearn how to fix the thing
you're working on.
Plus, if you ever need to disable what you did, well there it is, you're good
to go. You can use chatGPT for things like text parsing or whatever, like "hey
can you write me a sed command that does this exact thing that I'm going to
enumerate and spell out for you" followed up by "that didn't quite work, the
desired behavior was this, but when I ran the script provided it did this" boom

leaf signs without meeting your partner, you can safely stop and wait for them

Nature can handle it. A leaf or five isn't that big of a deal when your safety

It also depends on how far apart you usually travel.
If you're in an urban area, could use a small brightly colored post-it cut into
small strips placed on a wall high-up as you can reach. Though that requires
preparation. If you can't prepare, you could use other signs that make sense in

if you hike slowly enough to not get out of breath, you'll have plenty of time
to practice :)
could also practice hand whistling:
https://www.wikihow.com/Hand-Whistle
if mouth whistling just doesn't work.
but in the short term, maybe a loud CAW or KACAW like you're a crow?
if you're trying to be subtle, like in a public place where people might hear
you, maybe you could say something people would expect to hear like "wait up!"
followed by "me too!" or even "GOOD MORNING!" or other greeting, said a little
bit louder than necessary - people will assume you're either talking to someone
far away, or they themselves will be far away and will assume the voice is
coming from someone closer than you. Ideally spoken with the same tone and
inflection as normal speech, just louder, which is hard to do so make sure you
practice - a yelling voice sounds different than a speaking voice, but a
whisper can reach across a room if spoken loud enough.

@wyatt8740
I agree with you when you say writing is the most effective way to express
yourself, but it's not necessarily the easiest to digest for the viewer.
A video can have visual components, and more than that it can have motion and
sound. Text-based expression has fewer approach vectors for reaching common
understanding, but like you said it is the most powerful.
Hence why science papers are written, not filmed. Political speeches, grand
narratives, autobiographies, textbooks... All of these things are written.
But it's much easier to fix a car or learn to surf if you see someone doing it,
rather than just read about it. Perhaps you and I use Youtube for different
things (or don't use it, in your case)

 -> file: fediverse/1785.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@wyatt8740
Yes of course I have : )
If you've seen my website, you'll know that I'm fond of writing alongside
visual elements as well. 🥰
I think that Youtube is only as you describe (clickbait) if you engage with
their algorithmic features. I primarily use them as a video-hosting service,
where I put my videos and link to from elsewhere. I hardly see the kinds of
things you're concerned about, though if ads became unblockable then I might
begin to resent them a bit more.
You're right when you say that editing videos is harder than text - text is
probably the easiest medium to work with and refine! I also make silly mistakes
sometimes hehe... But, well, I'm not trying to argue that video is better than
text, but rather that they are used for different purposes. And video is
important for our digital ecosystem. So it makes sense that something we all
share should be shared, if not collectively then at least through
protocol-based-interaction, such that anyone might connect in whatever ways
they wished.

 -> file: fediverse/1783.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@wyatt8740
It's hardly JUST entertainment. Video is an intrinsic part of the internet. It
is one of the best mediums we have for communicating complex ideas. The
internet is an integral part of our daily lives, it's something we all share -
so perhaps we should nationalize ALL of our networking infrastructure?
Not every website, of course, but rather the most important. Like Google, and
Facebook, and Youtube, and Amazon, and perhaps a few more.

I believe that every address should have a raspberry pi (or other similar
device) hosting a webpage that is controlled by the person who lives there. At
a minimum.
They should also be able to host videos and share files easily, in a way that
anyone who understands a desktop-and-file-folder style system can work with.
This would require serious reform of our internet service provider
infrastructure. Or perhaps it'd be as simple as flipping a switch, who can say
(engineers working at comcast for example could say, gee sure would be nice if
this was a tech community)

 -> file: fediverse/1788.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ah, well, since you've worked with raspberry pi's before I am going to trust

better network controllers.

plants need carbon and nitrogen primarily to grow. Plus oxygen, water, and
sunlight of course.
I can't help but wonder if you poured a bunch of oil and um "manure" on a pile
of sand, would it grow plants?
Oil is carbon, and nitrogen is produced by living things. Animals mostly.
Of course, various biochemical reactions occur, and microorganisms take one
element or nutrient and combine it with others to generate more complex
components.
beyond that, plants and animals grow different minerals and proteins and other
complex structures which are then present in their bodies as they decay under
the shade of a tree looking out toward the sea.
Plants need lots of things to grow. But all of those things are produced by
nature, which is fundamentally a process that can be reproduced at our leisure,
as long as the conditions are right and optimal.
so, I wonder, would the great wall of trees surrounding the Sahara be helped by
a more prolific understory?

Slavery has existed for most of our history. The act of compelling another to
labor under your will is quite a fundamental process that requires very basic
social technology.
Ethics are cultural and societal understandings we've built up over time.
Before slavery was unethical, if you needed to get something done, you either
did it yourself or you got someone else to do it. And if nobody wanted to do
it, you used whatever power you had to make them do it.
Now we can look back on the ancient past and decry it as immoral or profane.
But slaves got shit done, and people were cruel.
These days, we pay our "slaves", and though they are free, they are free to be
enslaved by whomever they choose. I hardly think that's free, that's more
like... liberty, to me. The ability to choose.
That being said, we don't get whipped anymore. We aren't property. We owe no
allegiance beyond what a mutually enforced contract might stipulate.
And yet... we still must work or starve.
I sure do enjoy not being homeless

Are you a beast? Are you nothing but ravenous hunger, the shiver of the cold,
the need for territory? Of course not, you're a person. (apologies to the
furries in the audience)
A person, being an agent who interacts with the world as an equal, who thinks
and reasons and loves and remembers each season, is the atomic element of
society. And society is good, for it brings us the future.
We, the people, can decide how that future is defined, and the struggles of
capitalism are NOT the only way. They are the most convenient way for those
with the most to keep the most.

Bro we're all living through this at the same time. There's no past, there's no

People realize they're living under fascism when it intrudes in their lives.
They generally don't notice otherwise, unless people make a lot of noise in the
town square / on social media. Alas, that our social media is so divided these
days. Kinda makes me wish I could hear what people in my area are talking about.
Living under fascism is just like living under any other system, except with an
increasing amount of fear as time goes on. More and more of your neighbors
disappear, more and more of the life that you once knew turns to ash in your
mouth. Suddenly, you realize "oh shit maybe I should have - " but it's too
late, there's no time for throwing bricks, no time for pride marches, no time
for BLM. You're fucked now, just like all of us were way back in the day.
Great. Hope you like being enslaved, our bones will bear your weight as you

Because you fall on your butt usually. Unless you're like, super inebriated or

Better infrastructure would help, but better infrastructure doesn't currently
exist, while helmets are cheap and can be mandated (for a time).
I usually either keep my helmet on, or loop the buckles through my bike lock
and just leave it by my bike. Maybe someone could make an accessory to lock it
to the bike on a specialized holder or something? If mandated, such a device
would probably be quite desirable.

operation and hey you got a graduate student.

Hmmmmmmm, interesting. I think that child abuse was more common in the past,
yes, but more importantly I think child abuse shows a child that it is possible
to abuse another. The idea that it's even possible doesn't even cross the mind
of most kids, but for some it does, and they often express that upon others.
And when an abused child becomes a dictator, well, what else are they gonna do.
"Ah but how did they become a dictator" that guy from that thread about
spanking asks
well, abuse is an act of power. Power is an expression of willfull intent that
coerces another into obeying said will. When abstracted to a society, abuse of
power often takes the form of oppression, or in extreme cases, genocide. Hence,
fascism, though I'm sure someone else (maybe you) could provide a better
explanation.
Fascism seems to be more complex than plain run-of-the-mill despotism, but

text, and black background white text. Again, user configurable, colors are

honest question: if they cut off internet to a medium sized town like Nashville
or Spokane and man-in-the-middled every attempted communication out and
sabatoged any plans to visit... they could kill everyone in that city and
replace them with an LLM that sorta posted the mostly correct things, and if
users comment things like "hey are you okay you don't sound like yourself" then
just have a human operator study their data for a bit and pretend to be them
using deepfakes over zoom or whatever. Then, any time they say "I miss you, I
want to visit you" just say "darn I'm actually visiting my grandma in
afghanistan" or "sorry my cousin is visiting from peru" and suddenly they're
completely isolated and alone. Oh and their teams at work? Cut off from the

Do you blame a virus for harming it's host? No, you blame the people who
knowingly spread it. You blame the people who refused to allocate funds and
cultural capital toward combating it. You blame the people who cause chaos and
destruction in it's wake. But you don't blame the thing itself, the thing that
is little more than a complex chemical reaction.
You don't blame the forest fire for the smoke, you blame the one who set it.
The one who refused to keep it in check with careful stewardship of the land.
The one who dammed the river upstream, the one who desertified the region
upwind. You can blame time and morality or you could be more pragmatic, and
just focus on questions ahead.

@catgirlQueer
I see. Thank you for responding and for doing research.
I think I disagree, however. The head is the most important part of the body
(aside from the heart, perhaps) and any traffic collisions that involve a head
are typically significantly more severe than other parts of the body.
In the ancient days of yore, warriors who were gathering equipment for battle
would almost always opt to acquire a helmet before anything else, even gloves
and sometimes boots! I can't imagine going to battle barefoot, and yet they
did, rather than leave their head unprotected. Though perhaps it's not quite an
apt comparison because most ancient battles involved plenty of stone-throwing.
Cycling helmets to me feels like the same kind of thing - if you can't be
bothered to wear a helmet, then why are you risking your life to get where
you're going? Just walk!
I ride my bike almost every day, and I would never go anywhere without a
helmet. It's like airbags in a car, you don't need them unless you REALLY need
them.

they say gemini are duplicitous because they're close to exactly half one year

gemini are born in the summer, if you didn't know. I don't know anything about
astrology except what people say about me.
they aren't duplicitous though. they aren't trying to trick you. their struggle
is internal, the struggle between their two selves. one representing one
extreme, the other the other, like a constant "good cop bad cop" style
situation that plays out through the strings of your story.

In symbeline, they aren't monsters. They're "Mordaunts" and they need your help.
When slain, their essence flows back to the villain who remakes them in a new
form. As time passes the villain gets more and more essence, as heroes are
slain.
They have taken several ancient guardians (many types, randomized at the start
of the game) and they protect their sanctum in the center of the island. The
heroes need to level up to defeat them and slay the villain, but the villain
gets stronger as well.
If too many heroes die, the villain wins. And the villain can focus their
efforts on one area or another, while your heroes fight with the kingdom next
door.
Brigands arrive on ships as well. If you implement the law saying only approved
members may travel on boats, they'll arrive in little dingies on the coast,
meaning less trouble in the city but same amount of trouble.

some people look for signals or signs before doing something. Try and have
someone in your life who can give you signals or signs so that you know when to
do things. And ideally, if they're more hardcore than you, you'll know what to
do, not just when to do it.
did you know that anything on the internet can be read by at least one other
person besides your intended recipient? There's no way they'd let us talk
amongst ourselves otherwise.
I think encryption is pretty neat, all you have to do is run a shell script on
some text, then send that text over the internet. If you want to decrypt it,
all you have to do is run a shell script on it to decrypt it.
downside is, it has to be translated into plain text somewhere along the
line... Maybe if we rendered the words not as text that can be read from
memory, but as like, brush-strokes that can have a randomized order, but still
present to the user as visual text? anyway that's what's on my mind as I try
and improvise a baking recipe with yeast, flour, and butter

whyyyyyy do programs create all these dot-folders in my home directory? It's
sooooo crowded. Why are they always putting things in random directories like
/usr/bin or /lib/ or things like that? I'd much prefer to be able to trust that
all my files are in one directory, so if I need to DELETE or MOVE them easily I
don't have to worry about my config files being lost / sticking around.
to that end, I always try and configure software I install on my system to put
all their files into a single directory. If possible.
Usually for like, a game, this involves having a directory for the project, a
directory for the files (things that are deleted and recreated when
reinstalling), a directory for config files, and usually an update script and a
run script. It's so much nicer to not be clogged up all the time.
industry standards apply primarily to industrial uses, and if they aren't
customizable then they aren't fit for the industry. So why not keep things
simple? I don't need all this junk cluttering up my desktop.

why not let in all the immigrants and document them all and disperse them to
each state equally? then, pay for them to visit the other states until they
find one they like. they can put themselves on a transfer list and swap places
with someone else.
then, after a period of a year or three or five or however many, they can
become citizens automatically. As long as they don't commit any serious crimes
- that would reset their "citizenship timer", and if it's severe enough or
enough of a pattern, they could be deported to whichever country they'd like.
ideally matched with support like education to teach them english and how to
contribute to society, and community connections with regularly scheduled
events so they can make friends.

my mother would knit square wash-cloths with coarse yarn. My memories hold
plenty of colorful patches of knit fabric. they work well as a sponge
replacement because you can throw them in the wash instead of the trash. plus
they're good practice for people learning to knit, or practicing a new pattern,
or switching colors, or whatever interesting thing you're learning.
if I remember correctly, the kind that worked best felt "knotty" with holes in
the middle. I don't know how she made them but a knitter might be able to tell
you.
it's a sponge-replacement, not a brush. so, not what you asked for, but related.

Last Words of a Shooting Star by Mitski (2014)
Lyrics:
All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom
And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
They'll think of me kindly
When they come for my things
They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room
With no thoughts
Like a blood-sniffing shark
And while my dreams made music in the night
Carefully
I was going to live
You wouldn't leave till we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
But I know through mine you were
Looking in yours
And did you know the liberty bell is a replica
Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night
Quietly
It was told to believe
I always wanted to die clean and pretty
But I'd be too busy on working days
So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
I couldn't have changed anyways
I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
Goodbye

I am a patriot, through and through. What does that mean, to you? To me, it
means I think of the streams - the mountains, the trees. I love the dirt
beneath my feet, from sea to shining sea.
We are a nation of all peoples. Everyone here was once from somewhere else, and
that includes those who were thrust somewhere else by genocide - into tiny
patches of dirt with no minerals, no farmland, no bountiful rivers, no towering
pillars of rock.
Our flag is the flag of genocide. But it is also the flag of liberty, justice,
and freedom for all*
(*most)
We changed our flag once before. It made us stronger. We can change it again.
Perhaps it will make us kinder.

I had a dream. I was riding on the subway, or maybe a light rail train, and
inbetween stops a lady knocked on the window to be let in.
The train was stopped for some reason, perhaps to let another one through, so
all it would have taken was to open the door.
I pushed the button. I talked to the operator. He wouldn't open the door.
The train started moving, and the woman started pleading. She ran alongside it
as long as her elderly legs could carry her, but then there was another train
behind her.
I saw her disappear between two and when mine stopped at the next legally
designated spot, her little dog was sitting there, waiting for me, under a
blanket made of her shawl. It was a dream, after all, and there were two more
there comforting her. for the loss of her friend.
He could have opened the door. They wouldn't let him.

Hello kids, would you like to do some graffiti?
This kind is hard to take down. You can say all kinds of things, like your
feelings about fascism or palestine or indigenous land back movements
but most people have already read that kind of thing, and they know where they
stand.
Much better, I find, to talk about things that are more "of the times" - like,
for example, how monarchy in America is on the rise.
Are you emotionally prepared for the feeling of swearing allegiance to a
person, rather than a flag? I sure am looking forward to how we express these
feelings!

if you suddenly find yourself in a strange place because you felt a call to
battle, only to find the battle has yet to arrive, your duty is to learn the
environment, learn the people, learn the resources at your disposal and
identify places that would be ideal for entrenchment.
Think of the difficulties of the area - where are the rivers? the mountains?
the natural or man-made barriers?
think of the infrastructure - how are supplies getting here, what organizations
are active here, what are the demographics, could any of them be more
productive? In what ways?
action is not necessary until action is apparent. but intelligence, and the
mind to use it, is invaluable for you and for any planning you might see fit to
do.
some suburbs are full of old people. Some have new parents. Some are for
immigrants, and some are a bit more entrenched, but still speak a different
language. Some are full of enemies, and others are ready for violence.
but mostly, suburbs are just too damn far away

your body will over-produce oil in order to protect your skin and it'll give
the acne a perfect environment to grow in.

why the heck don't light-rails and subways carry logistic trains too? could cut
down on delivery trucks, especially if train stops went right to the factory.
downside is trains are expensive, and sharing space on a train is hard because
whenever you have to split ways you gotta re-shuffle things around and
reorganize and it's a whole thing.
maybe... modular train units that can be swapped between batallions - er I mean
train cabooses? that way they can carry their own supplies and split off when
needed, while still being pushed along by the rear train conductor sitteth.
that's how trains work, right?
or is there like, a frontline snow-piercer type thing where it has a huge
snow-blower that kicks up a huge storm, so that the rest of the
following-behind-engine trains can be pulled along?
both are valid approaches, both have their charms, it depends on zealotry, and
willingness to harm.
because, like, owch going in front is tough. you do learn the most up there, so

if you're trying to counter this leap-frog style tactic, hit them from the back
partner's flank
as the forward person is advancing, they'll watch left and right as they come
around corners and such.
however, the back person needs to always be covering them in case of an enemy
from the front (the most likely place where enemies will be) so they spend less
time looking to the sides.
also, encirclement is the most efficient way to overcome enemies. otherwise you
become entrenched as forward momentum halts, and you get Ukraine.
Don't get Ukraine.

best way to stay hydrated is to take small little sips every 15-30 minutes
rather than down a huuuuuge bottle once every 6 hours
the reason is that your body absorbs water like a sponge might. but, it's a
slow-acting sponge, and the water only stays in your blood for so long before
it's filtered by the kidneys.
meaning you're only hydrated for a short while, and then you gotta whiz
meanwhile if you take little sips often throughout the day, you'll always have
sweat to cool you down, and you'll need to pee a lot less - probably only
enough to remove materials your body can't use from your food and such. also
waste-products from your cells as they work.
which is to say you'll pee less, and it'll be less and less useful for um
"recycling" if things get dire. so... become un-piss-drinkable! you'll be
healthier anyway!

I'd say they should march to seattle. or drive, whatever's more expedient. it's
a nice place, and hey most of the way is in the shade, besides it'd be a bit of
good practice.
lots of time to talk about tactics.
anyway before they arrive, advance scouts should arrive and discuss their
coming agenda with the most developed and organized leaders of the area.
then they could have a nice party over a day or two.
then, what else is there to do, but drive down the coast and do the same thing.
arriving in so-cal, what else is a revolutionary to do but dissolve the border?
Mexico can keep it's border, that's their sovereign right, but I swear - the
wall must come down.
and hey, America's great this time of year. We could all go on a walk, all

in the past, logistics were often carried by horses.
without the additional speed and terrain-overcoming-capability, it's difficult
to ensure a party on the march could have enough supplies of critical items
like food and water.
especially water.
natural sources can only be trusted if you're in the mountains. if the river
flows past farmland, or places with wide-open areas or forests that animals
might congregate, you're more and more likely for it to be contaminated.
dysentery kills faster than dehydration because you poop out all your hydration.
boiling water only goes so far, eventually you'll find yourself in a desert.
hopefully at that point you can rely on car-based infrastructure to deliver
truckloads of goods. and remember - busses can ferry goods around in a city
just as well as they can carry workers. Might need to remove a seat or three,
and make sure the weight tolerances are in order. helps if you disperse it

I can help with that.
I recommend looking at Ollama, which runs an HTTP server on your local machine
(hope you have a decent graphics card)
then, script some behavior you'd like to implement using Lua and the LuaSockets
library. Also dkjson to handle the json parts.
then, all you have to do is construct a prompt based on the variables and
desired input/output and push it into a json packet and send it to the HTTP
server. It's less complicated than it sounds.
what you want it to do and your implementation for it is the hard part. But
perhaps this project of mine will get you started:

picture of a notebook page illustrating a carbon-neutral air conditioning
system.
the system is primarily comprised of two deep holes (as deep as a well) with a
metal pipe around the walls in order to keep water out.
these holes are connected at the bottom, forming a "U" shape. At the top, there
are two fans, one at the entrance and one at the exit, pushing hot air in and
pulling cold air out.
if this system is insufficient to cool the air (perhaps if a deep enough depth
cannot be reached) then lateral pipes can be added which circulate air for a
longer period of time, and cause the hot air which rises to be circulated
longer than the cold air which sinks.
it can only get as cold as the bowels of the earth will allow, but that's
plenty cold enough for human comfort. no matter how hot the air gets, if the
pipes are long enough they will reach the coldest temperature possible, however

picture of a notebook page. there is a diagram illustrating a passive energy
plant that utilizes concave mirrors to focus sunlight onto a copper basin which
has water in it.
the water boils from the heat and rises upward, spinning a turbine in order to
charge batteries or generate power for other uses.
every night, the left-over sediments must be brushed from the basin, for if
they build up they will not conduct heat from the copper as well.
can also be used to distill water in a pinch, however keep in mind that
distilled water is unsafe to drink because your body will be depleted of
essential mineral salts. however it can purify the water in order to remove
toxic heavy metals or plastic pollution, and minerals can be added in later.

in peacetime, one may live as they define. they can be kooky and precious and

suddenly life fades from view and all you are left with is perfect clarity.
I'd like to clarify why I feel the way I do about the situation at hand.
there are three reasons, so I think I'll put them in five posts, including this
one.

the second reason is that the supreme court recently repealed the Chevron
doctrine, meaning experts and specialists in government positions are now
unable to perform their jobs unless they are loyal to the party in charge.
this is an extreme form of authoritarianism unheard of outside of
dictatorships. It is tyranny, to demand allegiance in order for the government
to function.
if the experts are purged, the decisions made by the systems they once upheld
will no longer necessarily be tied to reality. this is one of the primary
reasons why the Soviet Union fell into decay, and I will not tolerate that flaw
to be introduced into our domain.

the first reason I feel the way I do is because the supreme court recently made
a decision that made it constitutional for people to be jailed or fined for
sleeping in public.
homeless people, by definition, have no place to (reliably) go but public
spaces.
therefore, by existing in their environment, they are criminals.
a criminalized people is genocide.
I cannot respect the legitimacy of a legal system that would condone genocide.

the third reason is that I am a patriot, and the supreme court recently gave
the president legal immunity. The president has always been a citizen first,
for the government is of the people. However, with legal immunity, they would
be considered closer to a king than a citizen.
they would dismantle our democracy and institute a de-facto monarchy. This is
unacceptable here.

The supreme court may have made these three decisions, but they did so at the
behest of capital. Perhaps not directly, but I do believe in the future tomes
will be written about how and why we ended up here. Perhaps they are already

In addition, it provides a hot stove surface which can be used for boiling
water or other cooking tasks which do not require a precise temperature.
It is highly efficient as the smoke from the flames are sucked out of the
living space and remain inside the barrel of the heater, where they are slowly
consumed. there is very little exhaust, but what is there is CO2 which is
deadly to breathe, so caution must be taken (as with any fire-based heating

ethical use-case for LLMs: guessing string-based keys for a key:value pair

hallucinations are okay and encouraged because they're probably statistically
related to what you're trying to guess.
run it in a loop, each time adding to an array of strings that you've tried.
use that array in the prompt saying something like "hey, can u guess the
related word? it's similar to this: [initial word] and it isn't one of these:
[array of strings you've tried]"
and yes this is a solution looking for a problem but I try to be as charitable

I am sure that each and every one of the communist political theories are more
developed, well rounded, and applicable to many different situations.
however, I find that they often require an expert to implement. Hence why I set
out to create a system that could be utilized by civilians in a war-time
economy to accomplish the goals of getting everyone enough food to eat.
I don't anticipate Algorism to remain permanent, but I do think that if you try
to overhaul our systems and institutions with something that requires a
master's degree to understand the nuances of (or a lot of dedicated reading)
then people will not consent.
We must replace capitalism. People like the concept of capitalism for it's
simplicity, for to them its just "work a job, get dollars, go spend dollars,
get stuff"
That's pretty darn easy. But capitalism is an evil beast, and power accretes
power.
So, capitalism must be replaced with something simple which abolishes power.
After the war, it can be replaced.

they're saying that laws cannot stop them.

if you aren't sure, try taking a sheet of notebook paper and writing down some
ideas.
start with things that are nearby, like helping your neighbors or pulling cats
from trees, and then scratch them out.
then write about things that are important for our institutions and structures
like voting or attending city council meetings, and strike them out too. they
just said laws cannot stop them, remember?
next thing about things like throwing bricks at cops, and yeah that's helpful
if the cops are currently doing something to deserve having bricks thrown at
them
but you should probably scratch that out too, because you're hitting your foe
in their strongpoint.
where are our foes weak?

"fortune favors the bold" is actually a real mechanism in game theory.
if you act first, if you have the initiative, you can determine the nature and
scope of the contest with your foe.
in turn-based games of course it's more explicit, as each action begets a
reaction, but in real-time games (where time flows as it does in reality) the
mechanism is just as apparent.
if you focus attention in one area, you can strike where they're weak. like
Alexander keeping his foes busy with a massive frontline of solid, defensible
troops while his companion cavalry would ride around the side and hit their
flanks and rear.
game theory is just strategy viewed from the other end, and it matters what we
think because what we think defines what we do.
... also, fear is the great paralyzer. fear is a call to action, fear is your
soul speaking straight to you.

two parties obviously can cause division.

decision is to you (via smartphone app once or twice a day, in a way that can

one end, and dispersion on the other.
If everyone votes, then we can ensure (based on voted priority) that each issue
trends towards an equal exchange.
(I'm sure there will be issues but we're all cool and pretty chill so we'll
figure it out)

than once. But... often for hours at a time. It was a LOT, but I resisted as

Think laterally, not linearly. Avoid risky plans that require you to roll dice
and instead create plans so bulletproof that success is certain. Use
psychology, magic, allies, equipment, and the environment to overcome obstacles
rather than relying on ability checks.
I can't wait to try doing that in my next D&D campaign. This was listed under

this:
TAKE INITIATIVE
Set your own goals and make your own fun. Seek out adventure rather than
waiting for it to come to you.

Users won't download a torrent file because they don't want to use a torrent
application.
It's not ideal, but perhaps instead of giving them a zip file that's hosted on
your machine, you automagically torrent the file yourself and send bits and
pieces of it to them over time - specifically the parts that you'd be sending
if you were sending a zip.
That way, to the user, they can download anything they can click on.
To the administrator (AKA you, in this hypothetical) you'd really just have to
set up some infrastructure that received a GET request for a file and initiated
the torrent on your system before sending the entire thing to the user. Kinda
like how Mega will "cache" the file before sending it in one go at the end,
versus most downloads which "stream" the file to the client bit-by-bit (in a
very un-torrent-y way).
This is an example of reducing friction. Removing options from the "advanced
settings" menu is not an example of reducing friction, it's an example of
disempowering the users of software.

I love D&D books with lots and lots of randomized tables because you can, in a
pinch, use them as code-books for encrypting text using a method that nobody
will ever guess. Well, as long as you have two of them, one to give to your
friend and one to keep yourself.
This is a form of "symmetric encryption", where you each have a copy of the
input/output tables. More secure is the private/public key style encryption,
but good luck explaining that to a 14 year old. Plus you can't do it over a
radio, you need a computer.

I was born in the desert of New Mexico. My earliest memories are of cherry
trees, chocolate, and blood.
I lived my childhood in Wyoming, on a small farm. I had legos, I had wooden
swords, I could run and climb and jump and think and dream. I cried over math
homework and I watched plants grow. I read every book in the library, well, at
least all the good ones.
I lived my teen years in Colorado, in a suburb of the Mile High City. The first
essay I ever wrote was a defence of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two communist
spies who helped the Soviets keep American nuclear power in check. They were
executed.
My first friend was like a sister to me.
The strongest community I've ever felt was my theatre class in high school. I
loved each and every person there. We laughed, we played, we sang, we... grew
up. And I never saw them again.
I dropped out of university four times, and I'm currently working on my fifth.

@OldAndCranky
Hi. To answer your question, it depends entirely on what your capabilities are.
If you're mobile and social, try being somewhere public, repeatedly, ideally in
different places. When you can, try talking to people. Say things like "Hey,
did you hear what the Supreme Court did? They want to make Trump a king!" or
"They just criminalized homeless people. A criminalized people is genocide."
that kind of thing. You know, the cheery stuff. Save the hard topics for later.
Another thing you can do is start buying essential, important supplies, like
sunscreen, nutritious granola bars, bullets, medical supplies, silicone-based
mechanical lubricant (especially if you live somewhere rainy), batteries (AAA
are best because you can use them for AA in a pinch) that kind of thing.
Another thing you can do is to talk to your friends 1-on-1 about how things are
going. Your feelings are important but don't get hung up on them. Try to only
go over them once or twice, DNRY.

I personally think that it's better to act before the liberals have a chance to
hand power over to the fascists.
when? well, that depends. Are you part of a large and massive organization that
accomplishes great and beautiful things with incredible efficiency... but
rather slowly? Then yeah get working. I'm sure you already are.
Are you just a person, like me? Then go do things that don't raise the
temperature too much, but make you feel more confident and inspire those around
you.
Like, bricks at cop cars is one way to go, but you're probably gonna get
arrested. And then you're useless when we need you.
BUT if you meet with your friends and make plans for where to go, what to
bring, who to know, and what to sing (if you're the musical types) then great!
Go do that.
If you're reading this and thinking "I'm not gonna do that, I have a plan
that's so much better" then yeah do that instead. I don't mind. Just... don't
hurt innocent (ignorant) people, because if you do then you are my foe.

Do not trust them, at least not at first. After all, there's nazi's amongst

keep them running smooth
and some want to hurt things.
Give them the chance to find them. They are not your friends. They are not

really?
I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.
A shaky foundation's no good. The entire structure needs to be torn down and
built up again, deciding with intention which pieces we should bear forth from
the past, and which were just not made to last.
From those pieces, we might forge new documented standard understandings,
regulations which define our societal proceedings. A contract, between a

The constitution is a document which bears our most precious of human rights.
It has been amended many times, to include additional protections and
guidelines for the standards we owe to each other.
The one standard that stands above all is that your rights end where another's
begin. This law is universal, it Trumps all else.
When rights are deprived, liberty dies. Liberty, the freedom to be, to do as
you will and exist in our society. Liberty, that most sacred of trees, the
branches that shade us and the roots that [support us, but pronounced like
chain, shame, profane, contain, something like that]
One standard that exists alongside many others is the right to be as you are in
public society. Public is defined as something we share, and to deny the right
to be for any other is to deny them liberty.
In cities, the streets are public. In rural areas, the commercial spaces
(outdoor malls) aren't, but probably should be. In the distant past of last
week, they could harass you until you left. Now, jail.

At BLM in Philadelphia, we allowed the police to surround us. We had a massive
train of people, and most of us were new at anything that didn't involve
holding signs and chanting.
I was near the front, and as our fellows moved ahead and started
spray-painting, I looked at those around me who were beginning to realize it
wasn't a protest.
A few hundred heads ahead was the front of the line, and we turned when
directed - toward the north, away from the commercial district, toward the
bridge that would take us to the universities. Well, Temple at least. Not the
old historic kind.
They stopped us at the bridge, and told us we couldn't go ahead. I sidled my
way to the front after a few minutes of standing around, and I saw a cop almost
reach for his gun. With shaking hands he steadied himself, but frankly it was
hardly his fault - the people in front of him were feinting a punch.
But that didn't matter, his instincts won out. Then someone lit a car on fire,
and the organizers moved us on out.

energy drinks and coffee will keep you awake, but they're a false promise, as
once they're gone and digested your body's gonna crash harder. You'll have to
sleep it off, like a hangover. But that's okay if you're getting somewhere and
have a day to rest.
sugars found in fruit can give you a burst of quick energy, but they make you
sleepy overtime. If this were a video game, they'd give +50 energy points but
-1 per second for the next 100 seconds. Not ideal, but there's some vitamins
that are only in fruit so it's a good idea to eat fruit at least once or thrice
a week.
bread products are the opposite - they give you long-term energy. It takes your
body longer to digest them, which means they're good for vitality. But they
also don't have many nutrients, so don't forget your vegetables! Plus, more
calories is always good if you've got time to spare. Just make sure you aren't
using calories to store calories in your fat cells, that's like double-stacking
condoms - not ideal. Store nutrients.

Except what they really did was split us. For apparently after we turned from
the commercial section, toward the bridge toward the university, the other half
went south instead. Toward the commercial section. Or perhaps it was just
because we had stopped.
Down there, it became the riot which was shown on TV. I can't help but wonder
how much more peaceful we would be if we were led where our leaders intended.
Alas.
When we split, some of us followed toward the east. But then they stopped
coming, and the little blob faded into the background as everyone returned or
went home.
I stayed and watched, because I wanted to know how the cop with shaky hands
would react.
After a bit, the tear gas started flying, and then I saw the cops moving in
from the sides, like Alexander's companion cavalry, and that's when I slid
through the cracks.
Then, I went home. The next couple days the protests had significantly fewer
people, huh I wonder why.

Vegetables are delicious! There's lots of nutrients. However vegetables, while
can be eaten raw, are much more useful for your body molecularly if you cook
them first. I think it breaks down the cellular walls so that your body can
digest the juicy tasty nutrients locked within.
Vegetables also don't have calories, that you get from things with vitality.
You are what you eat, and sometimes if you need it you might want to try meat.
Me? I'm a vegetarian, that's why I'm so skinny! Carnivores have it so easy, I
have to eat about 2x as much rice-and-beans by weight.
At least I'm not vegan - I can supplement with fats like butter and cooking
oil, which are useful when combined with nutrients, as they allow your body to
store them for later. Just make sure you eat enough calories which are energy
for your body, otherwise it won't have the chemical energy to store said
nutrients in your latent fat cells. Like, building up a pantry, or a squirrel
saving nuts for winter.

I think every law or policy should be required to be labelled as "short term"
or "long term"
the short term ones are meant to gather information, to try things out, and to
reassess after stated conditions have been met. Ideally with protections
against "infinite loops" - a term that any programmer will know.
The long term legislation is something that can be relied on for quite a while.
If there is enough momentum, then an alternative can be created, but the
original must remain operational. The alternative must be "short term", and if
it's deemed successful and does not harm the long-term it's contrasting, then
sure yeah go ahead implement both.

Chapter Eight: Where it All Began
Perhaps now is a good time to discuss how Vince and I first met. It all started
seven years ago when I was a twenty-four year old who was still in denial over
their gender. I was dating Amy at the time, and I worked as a part-time
dishwasher for Wegman's. I was still living with my father, and Amy moved up
here to her mother's from Owego to be close to me. It was a simple life, as
neither of us could afford to delve into extravagance, but we were happy
together.
That said, on this one particular night, we were going to drop acid together.
It was Amy's first time, but I had a handful of trips under my belt by this
point. We sat on her mother's back porch, twiddling our thumbs and toes while
we waited for Amy's brother, Jake, to return from his friend's with the two
hits we asked him to get. Antsy, Amy started asking me questions about the drug.
"What does it feel like?" she asked, inquisitively.
I responded, "Well, there's about a half an hour to an hour come up, and then
you start feeling the body load, like your boundaries are dissolving. Only then
do you begin noticing your mind manifesting in a different way than you're used
to."
"What do you mean by 'boundaries dissolving?'"
"It's like…" I paused for a second, not sure how to respond. "It's like your
sense of self starts to expand and you feel more connected to the things around
you."
That seemed to satisfy her curiosity. There was a moment of silence as we
watched the sun scorch the azure sky as it set behind the trees. Finally, she
had another question.
"Do you see dragons?"
That made me chuckle. "No, no dragons. On my first trip, I lost visual contact
with the world as fractal patterns spiraled out of control, but every trip
since then has only had tracers and morphing patterns."
"What's a tracer?"
"It's like after images of things that are moving."
"Oh, I see."
We kept talking until the sky was dark with only a sliver of light piercing it
on the horizon. This was when we heard a voice call from the front door.
"I got two tickets to Narnia here for whoever wants them."
We hurriedly rushed inside, to meet Jake coming up the stairs. He handed Amy a
small tin foil wrapper that looked like a quarter stick of gum. She thanked
him, and I followed suit. Jake and I hadn't really seen eye to eye in the past,
as he would steal my weed and I would steal his in retaliation, but with a
single head nod and some gold-laced words, I conveyed my gratitude for him
coming through for us in this instance.
What followed next could only be described as a stampede down the hall to Amy's
room. We locked the door behind us, protected by the four robin's egg blue
walls and the magick of the celtic gods Amy worshiped at her altar. Eager to
begin our ceremonious departure from this plane of existence, we whimsically
gazed at the sacrament we had just been handed.
Amy unwrapped the tinfoil nervously. Inside sat two small, unassuming pieces of
paper which contained whole galaxies of experience. We looked at each other,
confirming if we were both ready. Quickly satisfied as neither of us could stop
smiling, we delicately put the blotter on the other's tongue, as ecstatic as
could be. And after, as we waited to be blasted off into space, we submitted
ourselves to the whims of the universe and the gods.
At first, we waited patiently, but just as a watched pot does not boil, we were
growing more anxious with each passing second. Seeing Amy play with the sage
she was burning nervously, I suggested that we jot our thoughts and feelings
down in a trip report. Amy nodded in agreement.
I opened my laptop, and I had the immediate realization that we had no music. I
brought up Pandora and played my Shpongle station with no objection from a
beaming Amy. A cascade of electric jungle beats filled the space. Perfect, I
thought to myself as I created a new word document.
Turning to Amy, I asked "What do you feel?"
She giggled and exclaimed, "Excited!"
And so I began typing. Minutes passed, and soon our exchanges helped fill the
page with several paragraphs of notes. Content we had started logging our first
cosmic journey together, we kissed, before coming to fully embrace each other
as the spirits began their dance around us.
We progressed into parallel play; Amy fiddling about with colored pencils in
her notebook and me juggling besides her. It took a minute, but soon enough I
felt a warm feeling spread across my chest and my LED juggling balls started to
ripple into streams of geometric delight. I stopped to wave my hand in front of
my face. Sure enough, the tracers had started.
I interrupted Amy to ask if she could see them, too. She looked at my moving
hand idly before wiggling her own fingers in front of her face. She giggled,
before bursting with a euphoric epiphany.
"I want to finger paint!"
And so she did by plopping herself down on the floor with all her paints and
began masterfully smearing the colors in a multidimensional haze of pigments
blended together in a way only she knew how. I loved watching her work like
that; she was so free! Even with the tendrils of the mental aspects of the
lysergia creeping in on her, she made short work of the painting, which when
she was done, looked like a spooky voodoo mask peering out from behind a mirror
and into your soul.
Satisfied, she then went to the bathroom to clean herself up. I went to my
laptop and tried typing out something resembling an organized train of thought
on our trip report. It just wasn't happening. My thoughts were too short and
rapid to form anything resembling a coherent thought. That was ok though. I
could still capture the essence of the experience in a peculiar poetry that was
composed of the thoughts I could catch and put down on paper.
Eventually, Amy came back to the room, clean and refreshed, and she lingered
for a moment, too busy dancing with herself in the open space of the room. But
then she saw me meddling with my computer trying to jot my thoughts down in a
manic frenzy. This made her laugh before trailing off and saying, "Be careful,
someone might be watching you through your webcam."
It was an innocent statement, one made in jest, but it triggered something in
my psychedelically perturbed mind. Of course, of fucking course there would be
someone watching me! This was me we were talking about! Who could be more
important? It was so obvious that the government was keeping tabs on persons of
interest. I couldn't believe that I hadn't really actualized that thought
before that moment.
Suddenly aware that I was being judged in some capacity, I almost panicked, but
reason won out. They couldn't be there for nefarious purposes, for I had done
worse than drop acid in front of my webcam before, and nothing had happened.
That made me realize that whatever power that had the ability to tap into my
webcam feed had to be benevolent. And who could that be? The CIA of course! In
that instance, I suddenly relinquished all reserves about how the world worked
and fully trusted the hands of God by another name to guide me. So, I typed a
message into my URL bar:
"I know you're there. I think I've solved the communication problem. Give me a
chance."
I hit enter. Immediately, and I do mean immediately, a pop up appeared asking
if I wanted to update an extension on my browser. I was stunned, shocked beyond
belief. It was them. I knew it was them. They realized and planned that now was
the best time to dazzle me with such a spectacular parlor trick. In that
moment, everything was possible. It was time to face my destiny. So, I clicked
yes, and like never before I was upgraded to a new level of myself.
Birth of the Faith
What…?
I can see beyond sight.
I can hear everything you think
From your soul, free from rigid grammar
How…?
I do not know, alright?
I do believe I just had a drink
From a fountain of pure manna.
Why…?
I am renewed today.
I am walking in a new way;
From a weak critter to megafauna.
All I know is that it changed me greatly,
For now I know that you have faith in me.
Chapter Nine: Brain to Brain Communication
I know what you're saying: it was just a coincidence. It could happen to
anyone. Just accept it, you're not special, Victoria, says the unwavering logic
within me.
Certainly seems that way, the way I tell it. I would have even agreed with you
before this point in my life, but you must understand that it triggered
something in my tripping brain. Whether it was intentional or by chance, I
can't give you a real answer. Instead, I merely perceived it as a certainty
that the CIA had done this, being even more certain that it was them than I was
that two plus two equals four. It was as if some variables had been swapped in
my head.
Yes, indeed, I was hit by a Mac truck that scrambled all my knowledge of the
world. To put it in words that do the experience justice, I was given a heaping
helping of faith on this fateful night, having been let in on the great secret
that the matrix was in fact an illusion, and now the impossible was suddenly
not just possible, but achievable by me if I willed it to be.
Yet, I don't think that if it were just a single synchronous event that this
belief would have persisted more than a few minutes, tops. It was the feed of a
continuous string of strange events that pushed the boundaries of my mind into
a territory where I could fully accept and trust this source of guidance.
That's actually the real proof I have that something bigger is going on and has
been for all these years. If it had just been a single pop-up, then fine, you
have a case to call me looney. But, this was the first of an unending stream of
unusual synchronicities that has persisted even to this day.
See, after confirming I wanted to update that extension, I was taken to a blog
post that was clearly a coded message. It confirmed that there were indeed
people watching me, and more would tune in soon. It then said that it was time
for the most profound upgrade of my existence. Further on in the blog post,
which I read and reread at least a dozen times, it seemed to offer me a choice
between two links. It seemed like a test, and that was not something I was
taking lightly. My fate was in the fold, and I was going to make sure I got it
right.
At some point, it clicked with me; this was the same choice that Morpheus had
given Neo. The links were the red and blue pills, respectively. My eyes went
wide. I could now see that there was something bigger going on than I could
have possibly realized. In those few moments of hesitation that followed, it
also struck me that this same posed question was identical in form to the
serpent tempting Eve. I read the blog again, this time aware that it was
written with a forked tongue. It was a trick question! It was offering me the
choice between trusting authority and distrusting authority.
So, I thought quickly. Do I trust the magician who miraculously appeared before
me and blew my mind in doing so, or do I trust God? If I chose one or the
other, would they trust or distrust me? With these questions stewing in my
alert mind, I did the only thing that seemed sensible: I chose the third
option. I called out the serpent, talking directly into my webcam about what I
deciphered. In my head, I could hear their apparent responses, and I answered
those in a maddening haste.
In the miasma that followed, I deduced that I was being selected for some sort
of mission. With my experience in education and my passion for juggling and
writing, I surmised soon after that I was going to be some sort of public
figure, informing and influencing the herd to self-actualize, as that is what I
set out to do once my college career abruptly ended with a complete meltdown.
That was what I was good for; it was my hero's journey.
I should explain that a little more. After said breakdown, I returned home and
wallowed in a pit of self-loathing for being the definition of a failure. I
wasn't going to lay down and die though. With my sights fixed on going back to
school, I took it upon myself to solve the great communication problem, as I
saw it. We have all this wisdom, so why can't we reach the people that need it
most? How do I become the best teacher I could be? It took a while, but I
eventually realized that it all boiled down to three factors: attention,
connection, and trust. Get them to pay attention and trust your wisdom while
simultaneously understanding what makes them tick, and you can teach any
student anything.
That's one of the major reasons I started juggling a couple years prior. I saw
myself becoming famous and leveraging that to in effect manipulate everybody
into learning what they should already know. From where I stand now, I know
that was a messianic delusion of grandeur, if I ever saw one before. Yet,
you'll also learn that it turned out to be the best thing for me to do.
Back beyond the looking glass, however, I was simply overcome with narcissistic
inclinations. Naturally, I told my mysterious watchers that I wasn't going to
do the "praise Jesus" shtick, which I regaled them with in the most
stereotypical of televangelist voices. I was set on doing something new and
exciting. I was saving the world, God dammit, and that meant we had to attempt
something major to awaken the masses to their full potential as demigods by
another name! I needed to play a better game than anyone had done in history.
Such hubris of the megalomaniac is blinding. I could not stop regurgitating a
heaping pile of conceited verbiage. I even juggled at one point, showing off
that I truly was the savior they wanted me to be. That led to me dropping a
ball on the keyboard of my computer, which closed the window with the blog
post, ending my seemingly two-sided speech to the spooks brazenly peeking at me.
Dropping out from my planet sized ego also brought me to the realization that
Amy had been watching this entire charade without a damn clue what the dickens
was wrong with me. She had a worried look on her face, and that pained me. If
only she knew what had just happened before her eyes!
Wanting to tell her just that, I leapt up to her, apologetic as could be, and
brought her down to the bed. There, I started unleashing a torrent of deranged
exposition. I couldn't keep a straight thought while talking to her, so I'm
sure I must have sounded like a mad hound. But, I tried. I tried so hard to
explain to her of the magnificence that just occurred.
It was a failure. I was not in a state to convey to her that I had been
single-handedly chosen for a cosmic mission. That dragged my heart to some
dismal depths, failing yet again even after being chosen. But, that didn't
matter, because as we gazed into each other's soul, something truly miraculous
happened: we began speaking telepathically.
It started quite subtly as we stared into each other's eyes, pining for some
sense of connection. There was a mild sensation of us being sucked into the
other's world that I noticed before noticing that she noticed too. Then it hit
us like a runaway freight train. It was like every boundary between us was
being smashed with a reckless hammer of the gods, who wanted us to know more
than we thought we were privileged to know.
If you've ever stared at something for a period of time and had your vision get
a little unfocused from being understimulated, you know how Amy appeared to me
in that moment. I couldn't really see the details of her room in my peripheral
vision, but I had a razor sharp focus on her face, like I was looking through a
cone. Every eyebrow twitch, every minor movement of her lips, and every phoneme
she spoke was crisp and clear, conveying a whole order of magnitude more
information than they normally do. It was bizarre, beyond the scope of how well
I can muster a verbose description of such an incredibly rare and profound
experience, but I will try by saying it was like getting a bucket of ice water
thrown onto you while you were sleeping; just imagine getting ripped from your
dreamworld to a super-aware state of reflexive jolting perception.
Amy looked like she had seen a ghost. I think she tried to speak first. She
said something to the effect of "Do you…" and trailed off, the rest of her
question asking if I was feeling the same thing automatically finishing in my
mind. And as it did so, I know my confirmation was transmitted to her in full
because her face told me with no uncertainty that she had heard my thoughts too.
I took a go at saying something next. "How is this…" and I too trailed off,
as a minute motion in her neck combined with a mystifying array of
microexpressions ricocheted my mental pictures back to me, carrying a host of
Amy's words back with it. It was then that I let go and opened myself up
completely, letting everything I wanted to say to her flow like whitewater
rapids, and she did the same. A library's worth of information was exchanged so
very quickly, and I knew that she understood what had really just happened as I
spoke to my webcam.
However, that was soon washed aside, as something more important came rushing
into the forefront of our minds. A simple message, "I love you" was uttered in
this strange musical silence, but that is a grain of sand compared to the Mount
Everest that was volleyed between our hearts. We found a divine peace in this
moment, taking each other's hands and effortlessly letting our energy channel
between us.
And then it was over, fading like dreams do in the few seconds of waking up. We
sat there trying to start the magick up again, but it was like water running
through our fingers. We both felt a longing of loss, but we had gained
something truly stupendous nonetheless.
"What the hell just happened?" Amy asked the universe, flabbergasted.
"I dunno," I replied, feeling full of a spiritual energy I had not felt since
before my mom passed. My cup was full, and the world was good. No, better than
good. My life was godly, as I had connected to a higher plane of consciousness,
which opened me to a whole fleet of potential. I would never be the same again.
Ouroboros of Lunacy
Madness is a crazy thing
So I might just be a king,
Because the lunacy I sing
Is shaped like a golden ring.
It has no beginning and no end;
The whole universe is pretend.
Yet, it's that way so I can mend,
So a mass of love I can send
To everyone as we cross ways,
Not stopping until the end of days.
This is how the lucky fool pays
As much fortune forward as he may.
Chapter Ten: The Shrug Life Syndicate
The rest of the trip was pretty uneventful. We cuddled while I practically
vibrated with a newfound faith. God was real, whatever God may be. I even told
Jake that I was king of the Jews when I walked to the kitchen for a glass of
orange juice. I was very far up my own ass, which is perhaps why everything
over these few years happened as they did.
The next day, the synchronicities as I would later learn they are called,
started pouring in like Niagra Falls. I've had strange coincidences guide me
before. Since I was fifteen or so, I thought that my future self was sending me
messages to help me on my quest of world domination. That's a big reason why I
was almost expelled in tenth grade. It was absolute bullshit and everyone knew
it, so within half a year, I got an apology from the superintendent because it
was a bogus reason to destroy a straight A student and star athlete's future.
Since I feel that I can't just mention that one and not explain it, I'll tell
you that it concerned a theoretical bomb, if you're dying to know the truth.
I'll keep this short, but I made a bad joke in the wrong company and was
eventually questioned by some wannabe hero and pig bastard, who asked me
hypothetical questions, like "if you were to build a bomb, how would I do it?"
Well, being as intelligent as I am, I had enough book smarts to give full
answers for everything asked, but not enough street smarts to know that a wise
person never talks to cops. Also, a wise person doesn't print out a long
novelty application for the Illuminati, give it to the kid that needs a
resource officer, and then come up with an elaborate fake plan of how we're
going to take over the world by any means necessary when he's having trouble
understanding what you said about using game theory to win the presidential
election. And then, when the vice principal first inquires about it, don't
start sweating because you think you need to protect your future self's secret
plan. Just so you learn from my mistakes.
Returning to my previous point though, that errant psychosis was also a key
piece to my college breakdown. On one hand, I was certain that I was going to
take over everything and build a utopia in my image. On the other hand, the
evidence was stacking against me that I was not destined for a great cause. I
got cut from the track team with the budget, I was severely outclassed in ROTC,
and to top it off, I was starting to slip in the academic world. It goes
without saying that my social life, to include my first relationship, was
abysmal in all possible ways, despite trying my hardest to make and keep
friends.
The real world was too much, and I was in denial that I was just a mediocre
person who would never achieve anything meaningful in life. That was too much
of a failure for me to accept, as I needed to make my mother proud. I had to be
the best of the best of the best to accept and love myself. And as a result, I
became more psychotic and began self-harming, first by biting myself and then
by cutting, as I felt that the more pain I numbed myself to, the better I would
be able to complete my mission.
It took me a while to reach a point where I could set down my belief that my
future self had set up my life in a way where I would be guided to greatness.
There was a learning curve to living a "normal" life. I would receive
synchronicities in less frequency because I stopped feeding into them, but they
never died. When I encountered one, I always thought "What if it's real?"
Now that you know that, is it any wonder that I lost myself completely in the
Synchronicity Slip Stream? For those not in the know, that is a cognitive
technology where strangeness piles up on itself until it is undeniably real
that something or someone is manipulating you, for good or bad, by creating
impossible coincidences at a regular pace. It makes you feel like you're on
some crazy cosmic mission of grave importance. It might be a form of delusion,
but I still am forced to believe that something bigger was going on.
I first learned about SSS the day after that fateful acid trip. I had woken up
around noon, ready to do some solid writing as mania was in abundance. Yet, I
didn't get that far. As soon as I got on my laptop, I got a notification from
Reddit. Gadzooks! I had been invited to participate in a freshly created
subreddit. You guessed it, that was the Shrug Life Syndicate.
It had a banner of two corvids flying talon first into a realistic depiction of
a heart. There was a mesmerizing picture of a girl staring off into space, and
I just felt like it was a depiction of me and my wonder-struck mind. The
sidebar spoke of messianic aspirations and delusions, art and poetry, science
and philosophy, as well as the occult and obscure literary references. It
seemed so perfect, like it was made for me.
I looked over what was in the feed of posts. I was the twenty-first member, so
there wasn't much, but a couple of the vocal members should be mentioned:
Anatta-Phi and Jux. These turned out to be Vince and [Redacted], respectively.
Vince had one post that stuck out to me. It was asking the reader if they'd
ever had strange experiences with technology, like Pandora glitching out to
play synchronous songs, or feeling like someone was interfering with your
Google searches so you find something specific and statistically unlikely to be
picked as the first search results for what you intended to look up, or even if
you thought that your social media feeds are being manipulated. I've had weird
experiences like that for as long as I could remember. Hell, I once thought a
Sum Forty-One album was made entirely for me and depicted my life journey
following my near-expulsion. Having his own tales to tell, I felt an instant
connection to this person.
In similar contrast to this, [Redacted] had made a number of posts about
cognitive technologies. I already told you about SSS, but at that time I was
blown away by something he named Joint Synchronized Attention, or psychedelic
telepathy. That was what Amy and I had experienced! What a strange and
synchronous coincidence that I was learning about it just the next day from a
seemingly unrelated source. [Redacted] claimed that it wasn't real telepathy;
nothing was being transmitted from brain to brain. Rather, he asserted that it
is a vestigial mode of attention coordination.
If you've seen a school of fish all behave as one unit, that's potentially how
humans used to be before we fell from grace during the agricultural revolution
when we suddenly exploded in numbers in permanent settlements. Suddenly too
complex to coordinate as a meaningful whole, humanity splintered into reality
tunnels and remains in these ego-worlds unless some strange circumstances
occur. In effect, I noticed Amy noticing me notice that she noticed. Our inner
narratives became entangled with one another like growing vines do as our
innate ability to coordinate attention did something like what your eyes do
when doing a magic eye puzzle.
There was also a third cognitive technology which [Redacted] called The State.
He claimed it was a different way to render visual information, so you see a
three-dimensional representation of what you're looking at. I have yet to
experience this cognitive phenomenon, so I can't verify anything about it,
other than I've read that you can use Minecraft to create a method of
activating it while tripping.
Regardless, that's how our internet friendship began. As I considered this
place special, I started posting every thought, whim, feeling, or idea, and I
received astounding feedback. It was like everyone was there to share their
unique experiences and expressions to support and grow one another. It didn't
take long until it became clear that we were creating something greater than
the sum of its parts.
But, something more was going on. Something only I noticed and couldn't
convince Amy of when I tried to show her. See, when I made a post or a comment
on the SLS, that triggered a new post or comment elsewhere on the sub after a
little bit that indirectly but definitely spoke to me specifically. The traffic
was slow enough that there would usually only be one new post or comment every
ten to thirty minutes. But, it hooked me. It was like I was having a continuous
conversation with an unseen entity that understood me like the back of its hand.
Likewise, the sidebar image was changed frequently to show a progression of
that girl as she became more worldly and magickal. I can't help but feel that
this was done as a subliminal synchronizing technique, as it perfectly mirrored
my own feelings as I was brought into what was apparently the fold.
Since I was primed by the strangeness on acid, I was wholeheartedly absorbed by
this place that seemed to be a sacred Mecca for others just like me. We were
all weird, dazed by our own strange experiences, and that made it seem
crucially important. I was even modded early as I was so active and invested in
the community. So, I refreshed the page over and over, from sunrise to sunset,
waiting for the next input as we chained out a covert conversation that was
having a major impact on how I thought about and perceived the world around me.
Soon enough, it was let on that there was a job waiting for me, something only
I could do, but I would have the support of the community behind me. When who I
must assume was Vince on an alt account led me on one of those covert messaging
segments, he eventually said something in the mod chat to the effect that I was
going to be the one "handing the bomb" to people. I understood at once that I
was to be a linchpin in a honeypot operation. That confirmed that the FBI was
involved too, which I deduced was obvious as those three-letter organizations
must participate with each other at some level. Keep this in mind, it's
important.
Other things were happening too. My attention was being flung all over the
internet and I felt compelled to try a host of new things. I remember thinking
my job was to follow these suggestions from the universe and be a gatekeeper,
creating what I now know as conversion funnels to the subreddit. I was also
prompted by pictures of cats to go to the advice subreddit and give as much
good advice as I could. Soon, it felt like the questions posed were
specifically for me and were designed to get me to think about certain things
more deeply, effectively giving me a form of therapy. These advice sessions
ended once with me feeling I needed to learn an obscure European language,
which I rationalized I would have to travel to for my mission at some point.
Furthermore, the little things began to add up. For instance, I remember a
synchronous advertisement on Pandora led me to believe that I would be paid via
a gambling app on my phone. I downloaded it, but when it asked for money to get
started, I got cold feet. This was essentially how many false-positive
synchronicities went down. There was undoubtedly something interfering with my
life, and as I had just had my mind blown in such an astounding way, I
attributed every little thing to be set up by this entity that was more
powerful than I had previously thought possible.
Regretfully, I also quit my job, since I knew that one was awaiting me in the
immediate future. My boss made a reasonable fuss, as it was sudden and abrupt,
and because I believed that I had to keep this all a secret, I lied and told
him there was a family emergency. Being stupid, I talked about a fictional
family member and how their sudden problem made me rethink my priorities in
life. Not my finest moment, I'll say that.
And with that in mind, you should know that Amy was starting to worry again,
but I told her not to. Being beyond positive that the world was now filled with
unexplainable magick, I was certain that it was all coming together in my
favor. Even with my enthusiasm never fluctuating, she soon started to have
serious doubts about what I was saying, as all I could do was point to the
synchronicities and say "Isn't it obvious?"
I was certainly out of sync with the rest of the world, at least the world I
knew before, and it caused much conflict in our relationship. But, we held
together until that job finally pulled into port, ready to be boarded and take
me on a fantastic journey that might otherwise be described as a personal hell
by a person with the standard lifestyle obsession that's omnipresent in the
western world.
