        <div class="poem-content">My mom was always the reason I did school work. After she stopped pushing me, I 
stopped moving because I didn&#39;t know how to generate my own momentum. I had no 
passion and was listless. Least of all for school work.

So, how to do it better? Instead of buying toys and extravagance for kids, you 
should set them up with projects. Ask what they want, and then help them build 
it. Include them in your thought processes when you&#39;re problem solving, and ask 
them for input. If they offer bad ideas, then *tell them*, don&#39;t just let them 
fail. If you&#39;re not 100% sure but they&#39;re convinced, then trust them! Try it 
out, who knows. Maybe it&#39;ll work better than what you had in mind. The goal 
isn&#39;t to be BETTER than them, it&#39;s to make them BETTER than you! Not right now 
(don&#39;t push too hard), but when they&#39;re your age. Like, it&#39;s best if they 
accomplish more and lived life more fully than you did at your age, but don&#39;t 
push them to be wise or strong or intelligent at the age they are now. Trust 
that they will grow when you give them room to, and guide and cultivate them 
toward goodness. For example, if they do something wrong (hitting other kids, 
messing with animals, destroying objects) then guide them toward a better path. 
Teach them empathy, and show them how it works by doing it yourself! Ask them 
questions like &quot;How would you feel if that happened to you?&quot;, show them weak 
points and how to avoid them when playing, and give them alternatives to the 
behaviors they do that directly harm others. &quot;Maybe play with the dog this way, 
instead of being rough&quot; &quot;Maybe you and that other kid can ride your bikes or 
draw instead of fighting - or if you still want to fight, then learn how to 
tell when someone is hurt and try to help them.&quot;

The goal isn&#39;t to push them really hard off a cliff in a hanglider, hoping they 
can figure it out in the air, it&#39;s to strengthen their legs so they can run 
fast enough that they can take off successfully.</div>
