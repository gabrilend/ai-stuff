# Phase 8 Progress Report

## Phase 8 Goals

**"Website Completion"**

Phase 8 focuses on completing the website generation pipeline so that `run.sh` produces a fully deployable static website with all navigation working.

### **From Phase 7**
- Pipeline executes with zero warnings and errors
- Output is clean, minimal, and informative
- All paths displayed as relative paths
- Validation statistics are accurate

### **Phase 8 Objectives**
- Integrate complete HTML generation into automated pipeline
- Generate all similarity-sorted pages (similar/XXX.html)
- Generate all diversity-sorted pages (different/XXX.html)
- Rename "unique" to "different" for clarity
- Ensure all navigation links are functional

**8-002: Implement Multi-threaded HTML Generation** - IN PROGRESS
- ✅ Created `scripts/generate-html-parallel` using effil library
- ✅ Similarity page generation working (10 pages/sec with 4 threads)
- ✅ Batch-based thread pool with progress reporting
- ✅ Difference page generation working (centroid-based diversity algorithm)
- ✅ 62MB embeddings loaded and shared via effil.table
- ✅ Option C optimization: `scripts/precompute-diversity-sequences` created
- ✅ Thermal management with configurable sleep between batches
- ✅ Cache-based fast path in generate-html-parallel
- Pending: Run pre-computation (~42 hours), pipeline integration

**8-003: Remove Remaining CSS from HTML Generation** - COMPLETED (2025-12-23 re-completed)
- ✅ Removed 3 `<style>` blocks from templates (Phase 1)
- ✅ Replaced inline `style=` with `<font color=""><b>` tags (Phase 1)
- ✅ Removed container div inline styles (Phase 1)
- ✅ Verified: 0 style attributes, 15,576 font color tags in test output (Phase 1)
- ✅ [PHASE 2] Removed remaining 4 `style=` attributes missed in Phase 1:
  - Image tags: `style="max-width:100%%; height:auto;"` (2 occurrences)
  - Pre tags: `style="text-align: left; max-width: 90ch; margin: 0 auto;"` (2 occurrences)
- ✅ [PHASE 2] Templates now use plain `<pre>` tag without CSS
- ✅ [PHASE 2] Verified: 0 style attributes in generated HTML

**8-004: Implement Embedding Validation and Empty Poem Handling** - COMPLETED
- ✅ Empty poems now get random embeddings (seeded by poem ID for reproducibility)
- ✅ Random embeddings normalized to unit vectors
- ✅ Added `is_random = true` flag to identify synthetic embeddings
- ✅ Pre-flight validation in `scripts/generate-html-parallel`
- ✅ Pre-flight validation in `scripts/precompute-diversity-sequences`
- ✅ Scripts exit with helpful error if poems with content lack embeddings

**8-005: Integrate Images into HTML Output** - OPEN
- Image catalog exists (539 images in `assets/image-catalog.json`)
- `flat-html-generator.lua` does not consume image catalog
- Need to associate images with poems via source metadata
- Render `<img>` tags in poem HTML output

**8-006: Fix Golden Poem Box-Drawing Format** - COMPLETED
- ✅ Rewrote `apply_golden_poem_formatting()` with proper 84-char box
- ✅ Integrated progress bar colors into golden corners (╔═─┐ / ╚═─┘)
- ✅ Added side borders with padding (║ content │) to each content line
- ✅ Updated `generate_progress_dashes()` to 82-char border width
- ✅ Fixed line splitting and text wrapping to preserve paragraph breaks
- ✅ 244 golden poems now render correctly with 80-char content area

**8-007: Add Box-Drawing Borders Around Navigation Links** - COMPLETED
- ✅ Added corner box separator line: `╟─────────┐` + gap + `┌───────────┤`
- ✅ Added corner box navigation line with vertical walls
- ✅ Bottom border junctions adapt to progress: `╧` for ═ section, `┴` for ─ section
- ✅ Regular (non-golden) poems now have corner boxes connecting to progress bar
- ✅ Corner characters: `╘` (left) and `┘` (right) close regular poem corner boxes

**8-013: Implement TXT Export Functionality** - COMPLETED (2025-12-23)
- ✅ `render_attachment_images_txt()` for `[Image: alt-text]` format
- ✅ `strip_html_tags()` for removing HTML and decoding entities
- ✅ `generate_txt_file_header()` for consistent file headers
- ✅ `generate_similarity_txt_file()` with headers
- ✅ `generate_diversity_txt_file()` with headers
- ✅ `M.generate_chronological_txt_file()` created and integrated
- ✅ Pipeline integration (regenerate-clean-site.lua, main.lua)
- Note: Download links in HTML pages moved to 8-012 scope

**8-012: Implement Paginated Similarity Chapters** - IN PROGRESS (Phases A+B complete)
- ✅ Circular dependency with 8-013 resolved
- ✅ Added pagination config to `config/input-sources.json`
- ✅ Documented `minimum_pages` setting requirement
- ✅ Phase A: Core pagination logic implemented (10 new functions)
- ✅ Phase B: Prev/next navigation implemented
- ✅ Test: 134KB page with 100 poems, proper navigation
- Pending: Phase C - Export Format Integration (download links)
- Pending: Phase D - Pipeline integration
- ✅ Phase E - Chronological stays as single file (per 8-020)
- Related: 8-016 (validator) depends on this issue
- **Modified by 8-020**: Hybrid pagination strategy

**8-020: Hybrid Pagination Strategy** - OPEN
- **Storage constraint**: 45 GB Neocities limit
- **Full chronological.html**: All 7,793 poems (~12 MB) - NOT paginated
- **Paginated similar/different**: Max 15 pages per poem = 1,500 poems per direction
- **Storage budget**: ~38 GB used of 45 GB available
- **Reserved**: ~31 MB for Phase 11 maze pages
- Modifies 8-012, 8-016 validation scope

**8-016: Validate Poem Representation in Pagination** - OPEN
- Depends on 8-012 completion
- Post-generation validator to ensure all poems appear in output
- Optional `--fix` flag to regenerate missing pages
- Pipeline integration for deployment confidence

**8-008: Implement Configurable Centroid Embedding System** - COMPLETED
- ✅ Created `assets/centroids.json` config with 5 example moods (melancholy, wonder, rage, tenderness, absurdity)
- ✅ Implemented `src/centroid-generator.lua` for embedding generation via Ollama
- ✅ Implemented recursive chunking algorithm for long content (not triggered for keyword-only centroids)
- ✅ Created `src/centroid-html-generator.lua` for HTML page generation
- ✅ Generated 11 files: index.html + 5 similar + 5 different pages in `output/centroid/`
- ✅ Similarity scores verified working (0.72-0.78 range for top matches)
- Use cases: themed entry points, mood-based exploration, curated collections

**8-010: Fix Note Filenames in Generated HTML** - COMPLETED
- ✅ Created `get_poem_display_filename()` helper function
- ✅ Notes now display original descriptive filenames (e.g., `notes/what-a-lame-movie`)
- ✅ Fediverse/messages display numeric ID without `.txt` extension
- ✅ Updated all 4 file header generation locations
- ✅ Verified: notes show `source_file`, no `.txt` extensions anywhere

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] `run.sh` generates complete website without manual intervention
- [ ] All poem IDs have corresponding similar/XXX.html files
- [ ] All poem IDs have corresponding different/XXX.html files
- [ ] Navigation links use "different" (not "unique")
- [ ] chronological.html links point to correct files
- [ ] Generation completes in reasonable time
