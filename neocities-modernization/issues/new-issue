the user browses poems. they click a drop-down menu. they can select from among their pinned favorites
the style of the poem they want to [error: their pinned favorites not available, instead fallback to [curated collection]]
and then it would display the generated art that was derived from the poem they clicked on displayed in the style of the
poem or curated compilation that was available (calculated and cached)

(at first, make the drop-down auto-active, but as more and more of them get
filled out, consider making it hidden by default)

essentially, combining the forms of two disparate poems, and generating something
that was the same message as one, but the presentation style of the other.

rather than melange style soup, try making parts that are uneven. (this side
shift 40% in this vector direction, this side shift -60% in the opposite vector
direction. then, let it normalize, which is really all that AI training is do.)

(this should be considered a toy, and the link to any melange-style-soup-manipulator toys
should be recorded as a symlink and table-of-contents entry as "toys")

stored monorepo-wide, and genericized like the scripts/ and libs/ directory.

then make it abstractable to any AI embedding generated dataset (like the similarity matrix and embedding array)
and let the user play around, see if they can create it by routing their process
through some script files

"here's the absolute path of the similarity matrix, here's the path to the image file that this is based off of"
