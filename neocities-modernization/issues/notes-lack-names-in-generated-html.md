please rewrite and sort this issue according to whichever phase it belongs to.

the notes that are inserted into the HTML page lack names. The filenames are
stripped away and the ID is inserted like so:

 -> file: notes/48.txt

however, the intended behavior is that they read like such:

 -> file: notes/name-of-poem

note also the lack of .txt extension, as most of them don't posses extensions.

In addition, the fediverse posts and messages also contain the .txt extension,
when they really shouldn't. Please simply number them.
