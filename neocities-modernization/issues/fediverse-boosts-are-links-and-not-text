currently, the fediverse boosts are simply links to the post.

we should change this behavior to (slowly!) scrape the text of the post and
present it instead of the link. We should anonymize the usernames included in
the boost (if any) in the same way that we anonymize the usernames inside of
the rest of the poem text.
